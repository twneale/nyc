  a staff of administrative law  judges.  Each  administrative  law  judge
  shall  be  an attorney admitted to practice in the state of New York for

  agency  pursuant  to subdivision two of section one thousand forty-eight
  of this chapter or assigned to any particular tribunal or part  thereof,
  or  category  of adjudications, transferred pursuant to such subdivision
  that may be specified by the chief administrative law judge.  The  chief
  administrative  law  judge  may prescribe alternative qualifications and
  terms and conditions of employment for any administrative law judges  or
  hearing   officers  who  are  not  subject  to  paragraph  (a)  of  this
  subdivision.

    (d) regulate the course of the hearing in accordance with agency rules
