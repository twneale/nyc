Section 1048.

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  1048.  Office. 1. There shall be an office of administrative trials
  and hearings which shall conduct adjudicatory hearings for all  agencies
  of  the city unless otherwise provided for by executive order, rule, law
  or pursuant to collective bargaining agreements.  The  office  shall  be
  directed by the chief administrative law judge, who shall be an attorney
  admitted  to  practice for at least five years in the state of New York.
  The chief administrative law judge shall be appointed by the mayor.
    2. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of  law  and  except  as
  provided  in  subdivision  five  of  this  section,  the  mayor shall be
  authorized to designate by executive order the office of  administrative
  trials and hearings as the tribunal for the impartial administration and
  conduct  of  adjudicatory  hearings  for violations of this charter, the
  administrative code of the city of New York, rules promulgated  pursuant
  to  this  charter or such code and any other laws, rules, regulations or
  other policies enforced or implemented  by  the  agencies  of  the  city
  through  the  conduct  of adjudications. Pursuant to any such order, the
  mayor may transfer entire tribunals or parts thereof, or  categories  of
  adjudications  to  such office, which may perform such responsibilities,
  including responsibilities delegated elsewhere by this charter or  other
  law, as the mayor shall direct in such order. In furtherance of any such
  order,  agencies  shall  be  authorized to establish their tribunals, or
  parts thereof, within such office. No existing right or  remedy  of  any
  character shall be lost, impaired or affected by reason of a transfer of
  a tribunal or part thereof or category of adjudications pursuant to this
  subdivision except as may be necessary to implement such transfer.
    3.  Any  order issued by the mayor pursuant to subdivision two of this
  section may include provision for matters pending at the time  that  any
  transfer  pursuant  to  such  subdivision  shall  take effect and may in
  appropriate instances deem agency rules in effect on  the  date  of  any
  transfer  to  be  rules  of  the  office  of  administrative  trials and
  hearings. Any such order may in addition address circumstances in  which
  agencies shall continue to make final findings of fact and/or decisions,
  determinations or orders.
    4.  (a)  The  mayor  shall  constitute  a  committee  to  evaluate the
  adjudicatory  functions  carried  out  by  city  agencies  and  to  make
  recommendations  with respect to the transfers authorized by subdivision
  two of this section. Such committee shall be chaired by the deputy mayor
  for legal affairs or another  designee  of  the  mayor.  It  shall  have
  representatives  from  the office of administrative trials and hearings,
  the law department, the department of citywide  administrative  services
  and  any  other  agency  the  mayor  deems  necessary  to  implement the
  transfers described in this section. The work of such committee shall be
  deemed  complete  upon  submission  to  the  mayor  of  a  final  report
  identifying   the   tribunals   or   parts  thereof,  or  categories  of
  adjudications, that have been consolidated or that should be  considered
  for  future  consolidation, provided that the mayor may reconstitute the
  committee at any  time  to  perform  the  functions  described  in  this
  section.
    (b) Before recommending transfers of tribunals or parts thereof, or of
  categories  of  adjudications, the committee shall solicit comments from
  the public, including, to the extent practicable, any  segments  of  the
  public  particularly  affected by such transfers. In furtherance of such
  solicitation, the committee or a person  or  agency  designated  by  the
  committee shall hold a public hearing, on notice of at least twenty days
  published  in  the  City Record. Such notice shall specify the transfers
  that are under consideration by the committee for recommendation to  the
  mayor.

    (c)  The  authority  conferred  upon the mayor by subdivisions two and
  three of this section shall not be limited by  or  contingent  upon  the
  requirements of this subdivision.
    5.  Subdivisions  two  through four of this section shall not apply to
  the office of administrative tax appeals, including the  tax  commission
  and the tax appeals tribunal, or the board of standards and appeals.
