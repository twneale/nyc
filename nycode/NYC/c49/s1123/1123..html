  refuse  or  fail  to  appear  before any court or judge, any legislative
  committee, or any officer, board  or  body  authorized  to  conduct  any

  city or of  any  county  included  within  its  territorial  limits,  or
  regarding  the  nomination, election, appointment or official conduct of
  any officer or employee of the city or of any such county, on the ground
  that the answer of such council member, officer or employee  would  tend
  to  incriminate  him  or  her,  or  shall  refuse to waive immunity from
  prosecution on account of any such matter in relation to which he or she
  may be asked to testify upon any such hearing or inquiry,  the  term  or
  tenure  of  office  or  employment  of  such  council member, officer or
