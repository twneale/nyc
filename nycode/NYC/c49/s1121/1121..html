    &sect;  1121.  Agreements  concerning  performance of agency administrative
  functions. Notwithstanding any other  provision  of  local  law  to  the
  contrary,  two  or  more  agencies of the city may, by mutual agreement,
  share in  the  performance  of  specified  administrative  functions  or
  designate one or more of such agencies to perform such functions for one
  or  more  other  such  agencies if, in the judgment of the heads of such
  agencies, such sharing or designation will result in more  effective  or
  efficient  performance  of such functions for the agencies entering into
  such agreement. An agreement pursuant to this section  may  include  but
  shall  not  be  limited to the sharing of, or designation of one or more
  agencies to perform, one or more of the following  functions:  personnel
  services,   labor  relations,  facilities  maintenance  and  management,
  purchasing,  information  technology  and   telecommunications,   budget
  administration,  and  internal  auditing.  For purposes of this section,
  "agencies of the city" shall include but not be limited to  mayoral  and
  non-mayoral  agencies,  city  boards and commissions, and the offices of
  elected city officers.
