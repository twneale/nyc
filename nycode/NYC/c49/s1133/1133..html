Section 1133.

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  1133.  Transmission of reports; disposal of records; destruction of
  other materials.   a. The head of each  agency  shall  transmit  to  the
  municipal  reference  and  research  center at least four copies of each
  report, document, study or publication of such agency immediately  after
  the  same  shall  have been published or issued. The head of each agency
  shall also  transmit  to  the  department  of  records  and  information
  services  or  its  successor  agency, in electronic format, each report,
  document, study and publication required by local law, executive  order,
  or  mayoral  directive  to  be  published, issued, or transmitted to the
  council or mayor, within ten business days of such publication, issuance
  or transmittal to the council or mayor, which materials  shall  be  made
  available  to  the public on or through the department's website, or its
  successor's website, within  ten  business  days  of  such  publication,
  issuance  or  transmittal  to  the  council  or  mayor. The agency shall
  further transmit to the municipal reference  and  research  center  four
  copies  of  each  report,  document,  study  or  publication prepared by
  consultants, or other independent contractors, as soon as such report or
  study is released, and shall further transmit within ten  business  days
  of  release  by  the  agency, in electronic format, to the department of
  records and information services each such report,  document,  study  or
  publication.  Such  materials  shall  further  be  made available to the
  public on or  through  the  department's  website,  or  its  successor's
  website,  within  ten  business  days  of  release  by the agency. Where
  practicable, each agency shall also transmit, in electronic  format,  to
  the  department  of  records  and  information services or its successor
  agency any report,  document,  study  and  publication  required  to  be
  published  by  any  state  or federal law, rule or regulation within ten
  business days of publication.  Such  materials  shall  further  be  made
  available  to  the public on or through the department's website, or its
  successor's website, within ten business days of such publication.
    b. No records shall be  destroyed  or  otherwise  disposed  of  by  an
  agency,  officer  or  employee  of  the  city  unless  approval has been
  obtained from the commissioner of records and information services,  the
  corporation  counsel  and  the  head  of the agency which created or has
  jurisdiction over the records who shall base their determinations on the
  potential administrative, fiscal, legal, research or historical value of
  the record. Approval for records  disposal  shall  be  contained  in  an
  approved  records disposal schedule and remain in force until the status
  of the records changes. The  commissioner  of  records  and  information
  services  or  the  head  of the agency which created or has jurisdiction
  over the records may initiate action to eliminate records  eligible  for
  disposal.    The  commissioner of records and information services shall
  insure the destruction of disposable records within six  months  of  the
  date of eligibility.
    c.  Records of historical, research, cultural or other important value
  shall be transferred to the municipal  archives  for  permanent  custody
  pursuant  to a records disposition schedule approved by the commissioner
  of records and information services and, if applicable, the head of  the
  agency which created or has jurisdiction over the records. Such schedule
  is  subject  to  the conditions set forth herein. The city shall reserve
  and  retain  ownership,  possession,  and  control  of  all  records  of
  historical,  research,  cultural  or other important value in accordance
  with the provisions of this section  and  subdivision  five  of  section
  3003.
    d.  Other  materials  not included within the definition of records in
  this charter may be destroyed, if not otherwise prohibited  by  law,  at
  any  time  by  the  agency  in  possession of such materials without the
  approval of the commissioner of records and information  services.  Such

  commissioner  may,  however, formulate procedures and interpretations to
  guide in the disposition of such materials.
