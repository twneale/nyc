    &sect;  1130. Members of fire department; elective office. Any commissioner
  or any member of the uniformed force of the fire department  may  accept
  any  additional  place  of  public  trust  or  civil emolument or may be
  elected to public office. Provided, however, if  the  fire  commissioner
  determines  that  serving  in  such  capacity interferes with his or her
  performance as a member of the department, the commissioner may  require
  that  such  member  be  on  a  leave  of  absence  without  pay from the
  department during the time that such member holds such office.
