  promulgate rules regarding its contents, organization and management.
    c. The mayor shall ensure adequate public access to the information on
  contracts  and  contractors,  which  shall  be maintained in a manner to
  facilitate public  review,  with  due  consideration  for  the  need  to
  protect, where appropriate, the confidentiality of any such information.
    d.  The information on contracts and contractors shall be computerized
  to the extent feasible. The computerized information shall be stored  in
  a   manner   which  allows  for  meaningful  read-only  access  to  such

  contract  number  included in prior notices published in the City Record
  pursuant to section three hundred twenty-five.  At  least  one  computer
