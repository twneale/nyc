    c.  All  advertising  required  to  be  done  for  the city, except as
  otherwise provided by law, shall be inserted at the  public  expense  in

  with any law requiring publication of such matters or notices.
    d. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the publication elsewhere of
  any advertisement required by law to be so published.
    e.  The commissioner of citywide administrative services shall cause a
  continuous series of the City Record to be bound as completed  quarterly
  and to be deposited with his or her certificate thereon in the office of
  the  city  register,  in the county clerk's office of each county and in
  the office of the city clerk; and copies of the contents of any part  of
  the  same, certified by such register, county clerk or city clerk, shall
  be received in judicial proceedings as prima facie evidence of the truth
  of the contents thereof.
    f. The commissioner of citywide administrative services shall  provide
  copies  of  each issue of the City Record to the municipal reference and
  research center where they shall be  available  without  charge  to  any
  member of the public requesting a copy on the publication date or within
  a  reasonable  period  of  time  thereafter,  to  be  determined  by the
  commissioner of records and information services. The commissioner shall
  also provide free subscriptions to  the  City  Record  to  each  borough
  president,  council  member,  community  board, and branch of the public
