    &sect;  1059.  Inspection  by  taxpayers  of  books  and papers. All books,
  accounts and papers in the  office  of  any  borough  president  or  any
  division  or bureau thereof, or in any city administration or department
  or  any  division  or  bureau  thereof,  except  the  police   and   law
  departments,  shall  at  all  times  be  open  to  the inspection of any
  taxpayer, subject to such reasonable rules and regulations in regard  to
  the  time  and  manner  of  such  inspection  as  the borough president,
  administration, department, office, division or bureau may make; in case
  such inspection shall be refused, such taxpayer, on his sworn  petition,
  describing  the  particular  book,  account  or paper that he desires to
  inspect, may, upon notice of not less than one day, apply to any justice
  of the supreme court for an order  that  he  be  allowed  to  make  such
  inspection  as such justice shall by his order authorize. The provisions
  of this section shall not apply to any papers prepared  by  or  for  the
  comptroller  for use in any proceedings to adjust or pay a claim against
  the city or any agency, or by or for  counsel  for  use  in  actions  or
  proceedings  to  which  the city or any agency is a party, or for use in
  any investigation authorized by this charter.
