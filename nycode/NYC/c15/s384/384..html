Section 384.

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  384.  Disposal  of property of the city. a. No real property of the
  city may be sold, leased, exchanged or otherwise disposed of except with
  the approval of the mayor and as may be  provided  by  law  unless  such
  power is expressly vested by law in another agency.
    b. Except as otherwise specifically provided by law:
    1.  The  mayor  may  authorize  the sale or lease only for the highest
  marketable price or rental, at public auction  or  by  sealed  bids  and
  after  advertisement for at least thirty days in the City Record, of any
  real property belonging to the city or any  interest  therein.  No  such
  sale  or  lease shall be authorized until a public hearing has been held
  with respect to such sale or lease after the publication  of  notice  in
  the City Record at least thirty days in advance of such hearing. No such
  lease shall run for a term longer than ninety-nine years. Any conveyance
  or  lease  may  provide  for  the  restriction  of  the use of such real
  property.
    2. Real property of the city may be leased only after  appraisal  made
  within  six months prior to the authorization of the lease by the mayor,
  provided, however, that advertisement for a public auction or for sealed
  bids shall be commenced within sixty days of such authorization.
    3. Real property of the city may be sold  only  after  appraisal  made
  within  six  months  prior  to the authorization of the sale and after a
  review of such appraisal by the department  of  citywide  administrative
  services  within  thirty  days  prior to authorization of sale, provided
  that advertisement for  the  public  auction  for  such  sale  shall  be
  commenced within sixty days of such authorization.
    4.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of this charter, or any general,
  special, or local law to the contrary, the mayor may, with the  approval
  of  a  majority  of  the  members of the borough board of the borough in
  which such real property is located, lease or sell any real property  of
  the  city,  except  inalienable  property  or any interest therein, to a
  local development corporation without competitive bidding and  for  such
  purpose  or  purposes  and  at  such  rental or for such price as may be
  determined by the mayor to be in the public interest, and no such  lease
  shall run for a term longer than ninety-nine years.
    * 4-a.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  paragraph  one  of  this
  subdivision, the mayor may,  without  public  auction  or  sealed  bids,
  authorize  the  sale  of  real  property of the city, except inalienable
  property  or  any  interest  therein,  that  cannot   be   independently
  developed,  directly  to  private owners of abutting property, and/or an
  entity or entities comprised thereof. The consideration for  a  sale  of
  real  property pursuant to this paragraph shall be the fair market value
  of such  parcel  as  determined  by  appraisal.  For  purposes  of  this
  paragraph,  real  property  that cannot be independently developed shall
  mean  property  that  cannot  be  developed  due  to  its  size,  shape,
  applicable zoning, configuration or topography, which factors, singly or
  in  combination,  render  the  development of such property economically
  impracticable or infeasible. No such sale directly to  private  property
  owners  shall  take  place  without  a public auction or sealed bids (i)
  unless a  finding  by  the  mayor,  based  on  a  certification  by  the
  commissioner   of  citywide  administrative  services  that  independent
  development is economically impracticable or infeasible, has  been  made
  that  such  sale  is in the best interests of the city, and (ii) until a
  public hearing has been  held  with  respect  to  such  sale  after  the
  publication of notice in the City Record at least thirty days in advance
  of  such  hearing,  and  (iii)  at  least thirty days in advance of such
  hearing, a copy of the aforesaid notice in  the  City  Record  has  been
  mailed  to  each abutting property owner accompanied by a statement that
  the real property to be sold without auction abuts such property owner's

  property. Any conveyance may provide for the restriction of the  use  of
  such  real  property.  Nothing in this paragraph exempts dispositions of
  real property to abutting owners (and/or an entity or entities comprised
  thereof)  from any applicable review and approval requirements set forth
  in sections one hundred ninety-seven-c and one hundred ninety-seven-d of
  this charter.
    * NB Repealed December 31, 2015
    5. Any application for the sale, lease (other  than  lease  of  office
  space), exchange or other disposition of real property of the city shall
  be  subject  to  review  and  approval  pursuant to sections one hundred
  ninety-seven-c and one hundred  ninety-seven-d.  Such  review  shall  be
  limited  to  the  land  use  impact  and  implications  of  the proposed
  transaction.
    (a) A community board may waive the conduct of a  public  hearing  and
  the preparation of a written recommendation with respect to any proposed
  lease  of property which in the judgment of the board does not involve a
  substantial land use interest.
    (b) The city planning commission may waive a  public  hearing  on  any
  application involving a lease of property.
