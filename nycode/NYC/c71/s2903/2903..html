  provided by law,  the  commissioner  shall  have  control  over  and  be
  responsible  for all those functions and operations of the city relating
  to transportation including, without limitation, the following:
    a. Parking and traffic operations. The commissioner shall:
    (1) make such rules and regulations for the conduct of  vehicular  and
  pedestrian  traffic  in  the  streets,  squares,  avenues,  highways and
  parkways of the city as may be necessary. The violation  of  such  rules
  and  regulations shall be a traffic infraction triable by a judge of the
  criminal court of the city of New York and, except as otherwise provided

  police commissioner may, in  an  emergency,  suspend  for  a  period  of
  forty-eight  hours  the  provisions  of  any such rule or regulation and
  shall immediately notify the commissioner of such suspension.  In  order
  to  expedite  the  movement  of  traffic  or to safeguard pedestrians or
  property, a police officer or authorized employee of the  transportation
  department  may  order  a  person to disregard any traffic signal or any
  such rule or regulation;
    (2) establish, determine, control, install and  maintain  the  design,
  type,  size  and  location  of  any and all signs, signals, marking, and
  similar devices indicating the names of the  streets  and  other  public
  places   and   for   guiding,  directing  or  otherwise  regulating  and
  controlling vehicular and pedestrian traffic in  the  streets,  squares,
  parks,  parkways, highways, roads, alleys, marginal streets, bridges and
  other public ways of the city;
    (3) make recommendations to the mayor as to the design and location of
  highway lighting devices, poles and fixtures, and the type of  intensity
  of illumination of streets and highways;
    (4)  prepare  and  submit  to  the mayor a proposed comprehensive city
  traffic plan;
    (5) collect and compile traffic data and prepare  engineering  studies
  and surveys in regard to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
    (6)  prepare  and  submit  to  the mayor detailed reports in regard to
  traffic conditions in the city;
    (7) make  recommendations  to  the  mayor  in  regard  to  methods  of
  ameliorating  traffic  conditions  which adversely affect the welfare of
  the city and which cannot be remedied by traffic rules and regulations;
    (8) submit to the mayor  from  time  to  time  for  consideration  and
  forwarding   to   appropriate  city  agencies,  specific  proposals  for
  amendment of any resolutions, rules, or regulations of any  city  agency
  which  affect  traffic  conditions in the city, and proposed legislation
  which may be necessary to implement and effectuate such proposals;
    (9) prepare and submit to the mayor, for consideration and  forwarding
  to  the  council,  the city planning commission and to other agencies of
  the city, recommendations and proposals for the improvement of  existing
  streets,  street  widening  and  the  location  of new streets, avenues,
  highways and parkways; the location and design of  parking  garages  and
  parking  areas;  the establishment of public parking garages and parking
  areas; the location, type and design of off-street loading and unloading
  and parking facilities; and other matters relating to traffic control;
    (10)  coordinate  the   efforts   of   and   consider   the   reports,
  recommendations and suggestions of public and private agencies and civic
  groups in regard to traffic conditions and traffic control in the city;
    (11)  prepare analyses of traffic accidents with a view to determining
  their causes and means for their prevention;

    (12) carry on educational activities  for  the  purpose  of  promoting
  traffic  safety and free movement of vehicular and pedestrian traffic in
  the city;
    (13)  establish parking meter zones, determine the design, type, size,
  location and use of parking meters and  fix  the  fees  for  parking  in
  parking  areas  and  public  parking  garages  except  that  regulations
  pertaining to the use of parking meter zones shall not apply to vehicles
  operated  by  disabled   persons   duly   displaying   special   vehicle
  identification  cards  issued  by  the  commissioner other than at those
  periods of time when "no standing" restrictions are  in  effect  in  the
  metered zones. The parking fees and fines and penalties for violation of
  parking rules so collected shall be paid into a special fund to be known
  as  the  "traffic  improvement  fund."  The  revenues of such fund, upon
  authorization by the council, shall be used for the payment of all costs
  of purchase, rental, engineering, installation,  operation,  maintenance
  and  repair  of  parking  meters,  for  the collection of coins, for the
  enforcement of rules and regulations pertaining  to  vehicular  parking,
  the  collections  of fines and penalties for violation of such rules and
  regulations, and for the payment of interest  on,  amortization  of,  or
  payment  of  any  indebtedness contracted by the city in connection with
  the installation, operation  and  maintenance  of  parking  meters.  Any
  revenues  remaining  after  such  payments  are  made  shall be used for
  capital and other expenditures to ameliorate  traffic  conditions  which
  adversely affect the welfare of the city;
    (13-a)  in  conjunction  with the commissioner of finance and with any
  other city agency, enter into at least one agreement  with  a  financing

  credit cards as an alternate means of payment of fines, civil penalties,
  charges and fees incurred due to  a  violation  of  any  law,  rule,  or
  regulation  providing  for  or regulating parking, stopping, standing or
  trespassing of a motor vehicle. Such agreement(s) shall be in accordance
  with the provisions of the administrative code governing the  acceptance
  by  the  city of credit cards as an alternate means of payment of fines,
  civil penalties, taxes, fees, rent, rates, charges or other amounts owed
  by a person to the city.
    (13-b) notwithstanding the provisions of any other law,  consult  with
  the  commissioner  of  finance  or the police commissioner, or any other
  appropriate agency head, one or more of whom shall enter into  at  least
  one  agreement with a financing agency or card issuer to provide for the
  acceptance by the city  of  at  least  two  major  credit  cards  as  an
  alternate  means  of  payment  of fees or charges required to be paid in
  order to retrieve a  motor  vehicle  which  has  been  towed  due  to  a
  violation  of  any  law, rule, or regulation providing for or regulating
  parking, stopping, standing or trespassing  of  a  motor  vehicle.  Such
  agreement(s)   shall  be  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the
  administrative code governing the acceptance by the city of credit cards
  as an alternate means of payment of fines, civil penalties, taxes, fees,
  rent, rates, charges or other amounts owed by a person to the city.  For
  purposes  of  this  provision,  the  term "major credit card" shall mean
  MasterCard, Visa, American Express or Discover. This provision shall not
  be construed to apply to the towing of a vehicle in  satisfaction  of  a
  judgment for an outstanding debt owed to the city.
    (14)  enforce  laws,  rules  and regulations concerning the parking of
  vehicles and the  movement  and  conduct  of  vehicular  and  pedestrian
  traffic;
    (a)  Notwithstanding  the provisions of any other law the commissioner
  shall have the  power,  concurrently  with  the  police  department,  to
  enforce   all  laws,  rules  and  regulations  prohibiting,  regulating,

  directing, controlling or restricting both the parking of  vehicles  and
  the  movement  and conduct of vehicular and pedestrian traffic in and on
  all streets, squares, avenues, highways, parkways and public  off-street
  parking  facilities  in  the  city.  As  used  in  this section the term
  "parking" shall mean and include the parking, standing and  stopping  of
  vehicles  at  meters  and  off-street  parking  metered areas and on any
  highway in the city as such terms are defined in the traffic regulations
  of the city promulgated pursuant to law; and the  term  "highway"  shall
  mean  and  include  any highway or public highway as defined in sections
  one hundred thirty-four and sixteen hundred forty-two of the vehicle and
  traffic law.
    (b) The commissioner may employ, hire and retain officers, agents  and
  employees  for  the  purpose  of  enforcing  laws, rules and regulations
  prohibiting,  regulating,  directing,  controlling  or  restricting  the
  parking  of  vehicles  and  the  movement  and  conduct of vehicular and
  pedestrian traffic, which officers,  agents  and  employees  are  hereby
  authorized,  empowered  and designated to issue, make and serve tickets,
  summonses and complaints for traffic  infractions  pursuant  to  article
  two-A  of  the vehicle and traffic law and such rules and regulations as
  may be promulgated thereunder,  to  issue,  make  and  serve  simplified
  traffic informations and to issue, make and serve appearance tickets for
  traffic infractions, misdemeanors and violations related to the movement
  and  conduct  of  vehicular  traffic,  pursuant  to article two-B of the
  vehicle and traffic law and title nineteen of the administrative code of
  the city  of  New  York  and  such  rules  and  regulations  as  may  be
  promulgated thereunder.
    (15) issue special vehicle identification parking permits;
    (a)  The  commissioner  shall  issue  a special vehicle identification
  parking permit to a New York city resident who requires  the  use  of  a
  private automobile for transportation and to a non-resident who requires
  the  use of a private automobile for transportation to a school in which
  such applicant is enrolled or to a place of employment, when such person
  has been certified by the department of health and mental hygiene  or  a
  provider  designated  by  the department or the department of health and
  mental hygiene, who shall make such  certification  in  accordance  with
  standards  and guidelines prescribed by the department or the department
  of health and mental hygiene, as having a permanent disability seriously
  impairing mobility. A permit shall be issued to such person upon his  or
  her  application.  A  permit  shall  also  be issued to such person upon
  application made on such person's behalf by a parent,  spouse,  domestic
  partner,  guardian  or  other individual having legal responsibility for
  the administration of such person's day  to  day  affairs.  Any  vehicle
  displaying  such  permit  shall  be  used exclusively in connection with
  parking a vehicle in which the person to whom  it  has  been  issued  is
  being  transported  or will be transported within a reasonable period of
  time. Such permit shall not be transferable and shall be revoked if used
  on behalf on any other person. Any abuse by  any  person  to  whom  such
  permit  has  been  issued  of  any  privilege,  benefit or consideration
  granted  pursuant  to  such  permit,  shall  be  sufficient  cause   for
  revocation of said permit.
    (b)  A vehicle bearing such special vehicle identification permit when
  parked shall not be deemed in violation of any of the provisions of  the
  rules  and regulations governing parking in the city except where such a
  vehicle shall be parked in a bus stop, a taxi-stand, within fifteen feet
  of a fire hydrant, a fire zone, a driveway, a crosswalk, a  no  stopping
  zone, a no standing zone, or where such vehicle is double parked.
    (c)  The name, address and telephone number where the permittee can be
  reached shall be written on the reverse side of the permit,  not  to  be

  displayed  to  the  public,  but to be available for emergency purposes.
  Such permit shall also include on the front side  thereof,  the  license
  plate  number(s)  of  the vehicle(s) which will be used to transport the
  permittee.  The  commissioner shall allow the permittee to add or delete
  license plate number(s) as may be necessary; however, at no  time  shall
  the number of license plate numbers on any given permit exceed ten.
    (d) Any person to whom a permit has not been issued, and who shall use
  a  permit  issued  pursuant  to  this section for any purpose other than
  parking a motor vehicle  while  transporting  a  physically  handicapped
  person, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
    (e)  Certifications  by the department of health and mental hygiene of
  applications for special vehicle identification permits shall be made at
  those district  health  offices  designated  for  such  purpose  by  the
  commissioner  of  health  and mental hygiene. At least one such district
  health office shall be designated in each borough  for  special  vehicle
  identification  permit  certifications.  Such  certifications  shall  be
  available by appointment at each of said borough health offices,  or  an
  alternative   location   within   the   borough  as  designated  by  the
  commissioner by regulation, on a regular basis.
    (17) Establish and publicize a telephone number for citizen  reporting
  of violations of section 1203-c of the vehicle and traffic law;
    (a)  The  department  shall affix a sign indicating the aforementioned
  telephone number to all above grade  signs,  located  on  city  property
  which display the international symbol of access;
    (b) Any person, firm or corporation that is required by law to install
  such  above  grade  signs,  which  display  the  international symbol of
  access, shall affix  a  sign  indicating  the  aforementioned  telephone
  number to these signs.
    (c) Whenever the department shall determine that such a sign should be
  installed  or affixed, it may order the owner of the property to perform
  such work. Such order shall specify the work to be performed  and  shall
  fix   a  reasonable  time  for  compliance.  The  department  shall,  by
  appropriate regulations, provide for a reinspection  by  a  departmental
  inspector, if the owner of the property requests such reinspection.
    (d)  Upon  the  owner's  failure  to  comply with such order or notice
  within thirty days of service thereof, the department  may  perform  the
  work  or  cause  same  to be performed, the cost of which, together with
  administrative expenses, as determined by the commissioner, but  not  to
  exceed  twenty  percent  of  the cost of performance, shall constitute a
  debt recoverable from the owner by lien  on  the  property  affected  or
  otherwise.  Upon  entry by the city collector, in the book in which such
  charges are to be entered,  of  the  amount  definitely  computed  as  a
  statement  of  account  by the department, such debt shall become a lien
  prior to all liens or encumbrances on such property, other  than  taxes.
  An owner shall be deemed to have complied with this subdivision if he or
  she  performs  such  work  as specified in the order within the time set
  forth therein.
    (e) Service of a notice  or  order  upon  an  owner  pursuant  to  the
  provisions  of this section shall be made upon such owner or upon his or
  her designated managing agent personally or by certified  or  registered
  mail,  return  receipt  requested,  addressed  to  the person whose name
  appears on the records of the city collector as being the owner  of  the
  premises.  If the records of the city collector show that a party, other
  than the owner, has been  designated  to  receive  tax  bills  for  such
  property,  the  notice  shall  be mailed to such party as well as to the
  owner of the record, at his or her last known  address.  If  the  postal
  service  returns  the  order  with  a notation that the owner refused to

  accept delivery of such notice, it may be served by  ordinary  mail  and
  posted in a conspicuous place on the premises.
    (f)  A  copy of such notice or order shall also be filed in the office
  of the clerk of the county where the property is situated, together with
  proof of service thereof.
    (g) A notice of such account, stating the amount due and the nature of
  the charge, shall be mailed by the  city  collector,  within  five  days
  after  such  entry,  to  the last known address of the person whose name
  appears on the records of the city collector as being the owner  or  the
  agent  or  as the person designated by the owner to receive tax bills or
  where no name appears, to the premises, addressed to either the owner or
  the agent.
    (h) If such charge is not paid within ninety days  from  the  date  of
  entry,  it shall be the duty of the city collector to charge and receive
  interest thereon, to be calculated to the date of payment from the  date
  of entry.
    (i)  Such  charge and interest shall be collected and the lien thereof
  may be foreclosed in the manner provided by law for the  collection  and
  foreclosure  of  the  lien  of  taxes, sewer rents, sewer surcharges and
  water charges due and payable to the city, and the provisions of chapter
  four of title eleven of the code shall apply  to  such  charge  and  the
  interest thereon and the lien thereof.
    (j)  In addition to collecting the charge for the cost of installation
  or affixing of such a sign, the city may maintain  a  civil  action  for
  recovery  of  such  charge  against  a property owner who is responsible
  under this section  for  such  work  in  the  first  instance,  provided
  however, that in the event that the department performs the work without
  duly  notifying  such  person in the manner prescribed in subdivision e,
  the cost to the city of  performing  such  work  shall  be  prima  facie
  evidence of the reasonable cost thereof.
    (18)  upon receipt of a complaint in the appropriate borough office of
  the  department  concerning  a  measurement  error,  incorrect  property
  assessment,  or  that  the property qualifies for local law sixty-seven,
  the borough office shall notify the property owner, within ten  business
  days,  in  writing, where appropriate, that all records will be reviewed
  and the results will be sent, if applicable, to the sidewalk  assessment
  review  board  within  the  department  for review within thirty days of
  receipt of the complaint. The property owner may schedule an appointment
  in the appropriate borough office  of  the  department  to  review  that
  property  owner's  records.  The appropriate borough office shall notify
  the property owner of  the  determination  of  the  sidewalk  assessment
  review  board  in  writing within fifteen business days of receiving the
  determination from the sidewalk assessment  review  board.  The  borough
  office  shall  also  notify  the  property  owner in writing that if the
  property owner is not satisfied with the determination, of the right  to
  file a notice of claim with the office of the comptroller as provided by
  section  19-152.2 of the administrative code of the city of New York and
  of the right to file a petition for appeal and commence a proceeding  to
  review  and/or  correct the notice of account and/or the quality of work
  performed under the direction of the department in the  manner  provided
  by  section 19-152.3 of the administrative code of the city of New York.
  Such notice shall also include the appropriate claim form  to  be  filed
  with the office of the comptroller.
    Upon  receipt  of  complaint  in the appropriate borough office of the
  department regarding the quality of work, the department shall  send  an
  inspector  to  investigate  the  complaint  within  thirty  days.  Where
  appropriate the department shall notify the property owner in writing of
  the inspection date at least five days prior to the inspection date.  If

  the  quality  of  the  work  is determined to be poor, the work shall be
  corrected by  the  appropriate  contractor  within  eighteen  months  of
  substantial   completion.   If  the  property  owner  alleges  that  the
  subsequent  or  the  corrective  work  was  of  poor  quality, or if the
  inspector determines that no correction is required, the property  owner
  shall  be  informed  in  writing, where appropriate, within ten business
  days, by the appropriate borough office of the department of  the  right
  to file a notice of claim with the office of the comptroller as provided
  in  section  19-152.2 of the administrative code of the city of New York
  and of the right to file a petition for appeal and commence a proceeding
  to review and/or correct the notice of account  and/or  the  quality  of
  work performed under the direction of or by the department in the manner
  provided  by  section 19-152.3 of the administrative code of the city of
  New York. Such notice shall also include the appropriate claim  form  to
  be filed with the office of the comptroller. Upon receipt of a complaint
  other  than a measurement error, incorrect property assessment, that the
  property qualifies for local law sixty-seven or  concerning  quality  of
  work  performed  under  the  direction  of  or  by the department in the
  appropriate borough office of the department,  the  appropriate  borough
  office  shall notify, in writing, where appropriate, within ten business
  days, of the right to file a notice of claim  with  the  office  of  the
  comptroller  as  provided by section 19-152.2 of the administrative code
  of the city of New York and of the right to file a petition  for  appeal
  and commence a proceeding to review and/or correct the notice of account
  in the manner provided by section 19-152.3 of the administrative code of
  the  city  of  New  York.  Upon  request  of  the owner of property, the
  department through the appropriate borough office shall  within  fifteen
  business days provide for the reinspection as provided in section 19-152
  of  the administrative code of the city of New York. Upon request of the
  owner of property, the appropriate borough office shall  within  fifteen
  business days provide for the reinspection as provided in section 19-152

  also  post  signs  in conspicuous places in the borough offices advising
  the public of such rights;
