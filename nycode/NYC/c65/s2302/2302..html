  shall  contain  information  regarding  complaints   received   by   the
  commission from the public, including, but not limited to, complaints of
  overcharging,   as   well  as  enforcement  actions  undertaken  by  the
  commission, whether the enforcement action was dismissed or settled,  or
  if  a  penalty  was  imposed  by  the  commission  on the subject of the
  enforcement action. The information regarding enforcement actions  shall
  include,  but not be limited to, enforcement actions relating to illegal
  street  hails,  unlicensed  vehicles,  overcharging,   and   toll   lane
  infractions.  The  complaint and enforcement action information shall be
  disaggregated by the type of license held by the person or entity who is
  the subject of the complaint or action and the month  during  which  the
  complaint  was  received  or  enforcement action undertaken. Enforcement
  actions shall be further disaggregated by  the  subject  matter  of  the
  action  and  geographic location. Complaint information shall be further
  disaggregated to the extent practicable by the  subject  matter  of  the
  complaint.  In  addition to inclusion in the commission's annual report,
  the disaggregated complaint and enforcement information shall be  posted
  on  the  commission's  website updated no less than monthly. Information
  shall be published in a manner that does  not  identify  the  individual
  parties  involved  in  the  actions  reported  upon in this section. The
  chairman of the city council committee on transportation may at any time
  direct the commission or the chairman of the commission to appear before
  the committee to give testimony pertaining thereto, and  to  furnish  to
  the members of the council any reports deemed necessary.
    b. The commission shall make a quarterly report to the city council on
  or  before  the  second Monday of March, June, September and December in
  each year. Each such quarterly report shall contain information for  the

  contain  the number of instances when the wait for an inspection exceeds
  four weeks. All information shall be disaggregated by vehicle type.
