Section 107.

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  107.  Budget modification.   a.   Subject to the quarterly spending
  allotments  and  aggregate  position  and    salary  limits  established
  pursuant  to section one hundred six, and to other applicable provisions
  of this charter, of the civil service law and of other law,  changes  in
  schedules,  within  units  of  appropriation, may be made by the head of
  each agency.  Any such changes shall be reported to the  mayor  and  the
  comptroller      before  the  effective  date thereof, and shall be made
  available for public inspection under reasonable terms and conditions.
    b.  The mayor during any fiscal year may transfer part or all  of  any
  unit of appropriation to another unit of appropriation, except that when
  any  such  transfer (1) shall be from one agency to another or (2) shall
  result in any unit of appropriation having been increased  or  decreased
  by  more  than  five  per  cent  or fifty thousand dollars, whichever is
  greater, from the budget as adopted for such unit of appropriation,  the
  mayor  shall  notify  the council of the proposed action.  Within thirty
  days after the first stated meeting of the council following the receipt
  of such notice,    the  council  may  disapprove  the  proposed  action;
  provided, however, that the mayor may recommend such a transfer if it is
  related  to  an appropriation included in the budget pursuant to section
  one hundred two only  with  the  concurrence  of  the  relevant  borough
  president;  and  a borough president may make such a recommendation with
  regard to such an appropriation if it is concurred in by the  mayor  and
  does not include a reduction in an appropriation other than one included
  in  the budget pursuant to section one hundred two on the recommendation
  of such borough president.  Written notice of any transfer  pursuant  to
  this  subdivision  shall  be  given  to  the  comptroller  and  shall be
  published in the City Record as soon as possible after such transfer.
    c.  The provisions of this section shall not be  deemed  to  authorize
  any transfer from appropriations required by law.
    d.  The council may during any fiscal year transfer part or all of any
  unit  of  appropriation  within  the  council appropriation to any other
  council unit of appropriation for any of its programs or projects or for
  any other purpose, solely by adoption of a  council  resolution.    Each
  such  transfer  shall be published in the City Record and written notice
  thereof shall be given to the mayor and to the comptroller not less than
  ten days before the effective date thereof.
    e.  The procedures and required approvals  pursuant  to  sections  two
  hundred  fifty-four,  two hundred fifty-five, and two hundred fifty-six,
  without regard to the dates specified therein, shall be followed in  the
  case  of:  (1)  any  proposed  amendment  to  the  budget respecting the
  creation of new units of appropriation; or (2) the appropriation of  new
  revenues  from  any  source  except  for revenues from federal, state or
  private sources  in  regard  to  the  use  of  which  the  city  has  no
  discretion;  provided,  however, that the mayor shall give notice to the
  council of the receipt and proposed utilization of any such revenues; or
  (3) the proposed use by the  city  of  previously  unappropriated  funds
  received  from  any  source.    Any  request  by the mayor respecting an
  amendment to the budget that involves an increase in the budget shall be
  accompanied by a statement of the source of current  revenues  or  other
  identifiable  and  currently available funds required for the payment of
  such additional amounts.
