    &sect;  100.  Format  of expense budget departmental estimates, preliminary
  expense budget, and executive expense budget.   a.   The expense  budget
  departmental   estimates,   the  preliminary  expense  budget,  and  the
  executive expense budget for each year shall consist of  proposed  units
  of   appropriation   for   personal   service   and  proposed  units  of
  appropriation for other than personal service  for  the  ensuing  fiscal
  year.
    b.  Each  agency  head, for the departmental estimates, and the mayor,
  for the executive budget, shall submit (i) a statement of the impact  of
  the  proposed  units  of  appropriation  on  the level of services to be
  provided during the ensuing fiscal year and (ii)  a written response  to
  each  of  the  expense  budget  priorities  included in   each community
  board's statement of budget  priorities  submitted  in  accordance  with
  section  two  hundred thirty of this charter,  including the disposition
  of each such priority and a meaningful explanation of  any  disapprovals
  contained in such estimates or budget.
    c.  Each  proposed  unit  of  appropriation shall represent the amount
  requested for personal service or for other than personal service for  a
  particular program, purpose, activity or institution; provided, however,
  that  a  single  unit  of appropriation for personal service or a single
  unit of appropriation for other than personal service may represent  the
  amount requested for more than one particular program, purpose, activity
  or  institution if the council has adopted, on the recommendation of the
  mayor, or if the council has adopted on its own initiative and the mayor
  has approved, a resolution setting forth the names, and a  statement  of
  the  programmatic  objectives,  of  each  program,  purpose, activity or
  institution to be included in  such  a  single  unit  of  appropriation.
  Copies  of  such  resolutions  must  be  included  as an appendix to any
  preliminary budget, executive budget, and adopted budget to  which  they
  apply.    If,  in  accordance with such a resolution, a proposed unit of
  appropriation for other than personal service shall represent the  total
  amount  requested  for  other  than  personal  service for more than one
  proposed unit of appropriation for personal service, the amount of  such
  unit of appropriation for other than personal service which is allocable
  to  each  unit  of appropriation for personal service shall be set forth
  for informational purposes at the end of each such unit of appropriation
  for personal service.   If, in accordance  with  such  a  resolution,  a
  proposed  unit of appropriation for personal service shall represent the
  total amount requested for personal service for more than  one  proposed
  unit  of  appropriation  for  other than personal service, the amount of
  such unit of appropriation for personal service which  is  allocable  to
  each  unit of appropriation for other than personal service shall be set
  forth for informational purposes  at  the  end  of  each  such  unit  of
  appropriation for other than personal service.
    d.   Each proposed unit of appropriation contained in the departmental
  estimates, the preliminary expense  budget  and  the  executive  expense
  budget   shall  be  accompanied  by  a  statement  of  the  programmatic
  objectives of the program, purpose, activity or institution involved.
    e.  Each proposed unit of appropriation contained in the  departmental
  estimates  and  the  executive budget shall be   supported by line items
  showing how the total amount of such unit is determined.
    f.  The departmental estimates shall be in such form and contain  such
  further  information as may be required by the mayor or by law and shall
  be public records which shall at all reasonable times be open to  public
  inspection.
    g.    For each city agency that has local or borough service districts
  within community districts and boroughs, the departmental estimates  and
  the  executive  budget,  where practicable, shall contain a statement of

  proposed direct expenditures in each  such  service  district  for  each
  requested unit of appropriation.
    h.   The departmental estimates and the executive expense budget shall
  include a contract budget prepared in accordance with the provisions  of
  section one hundred four.
