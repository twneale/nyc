Section 104.

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  104.  Contract  budget.  a. Each contract budget shall set forth by
  agency each major category of contractual  services  and  each  multiple
  purpose  category  of  contractual services for which appropriations are
  being proposed.
    b. Each agency head for the departmental estimates, the mayor for  the
  executive budget, and the council for the adopted budget by a resolution
  adopted  with  the  budget,  shall  certify  that each major category of
  contractual services is presented as such and that no  multiple  purpose
  category contains a major category of contractual services.
    c. For purposes of this section
    1. the term "major category" shall mean:
    (a) a programmatic category related to a major service provided by the
  agency  or  a  major  responsibility  of the agency regardless of dollar
  amount; or
    (b) a programmatic category related to a particular state  or  federal
  requirement; or
    (c) a subcategory of those categories set forth in subparagraph a or b
  of this paragraph where the dollar amount constitutes a major commitment
  of city funds; or
    (d) a category established by the council as a major category pursuant
  to subdivision f of this section; or
    (e) a category certified by the mayor as a major category.
    2. the term "multiple purpose category" shall mean:
    (a)  groupings  of  contractual services for related purposes, none of
  which individually constitute  a  major  category,  but  which  together
  facilitate  public  understanding of contractual spending provided by an
  agency; or
    (b) a grouping of unrelated contractual services,  which  individually
  do  not  constitute  a  major  category, and which are not appropriately
  grouped with other contractual spending of the agency.
    3. the term "contractual services" shall mean technical, consultant or
  personal services provided to the city through contracts.
    d. Major categories. Each major category of contractual services shall
  be accompanied by a detailed description of the programmatic  objectives
  of the category, the number of contracts estimated to be included in the
  category and the proposed appropriations for that category.
    e.  Multiple  purpose categories. All other contractual services shall
  be aggregated in multiple  purpose  categories.  Each  multiple  purpose
  category shall be accompanied by the number of contracts estimated to be
  included  in  the  category and the supporting schedules identifying the
  purposes and amounts involved in sufficient detail to allow the  council
  to  certify  that  the  category  does  not  contain major categories of
  contractual services.
    f. Change of categories. The council may alter  any  category  in  the
  contract  budget  submitted  by  the  mayor,  or  change  any  terms and
  conditions of it. The mayor shall  provide  sufficient  information  and
  technical  assistance to allow the council to certify each category as a
  major or  multiple  purpose  category.  The  mayor  may  disapprove  any
  alteration  by the council. The mayor's disapproval may be overridden by
  a two-thirds vote of all of the members of the council.
    g. Adoption of contract budget. The council  may  increase,  decrease,
  add or omit any amount in the contract budget as submitted by the mayor,
  or  change  any terms and conditions of the amount in that category. The
  mayor may disapprove any increase or addition  to  the  amounts  in  the
  categories,  or  any  change  in  any term and condition of the contract
  budget. The mayor's disapproval may be overridden by a  two-thirds  vote
  of all of the members of the council.

    h.  Modification of terms and conditions. All spending for contractual
  services shall be in accordance with the terms  and  conditions  of  the
  contract  budget  as  adopted; provided, however, that during any fiscal
  year the mayor shall notify the council of any proposed modification  of
  such a term or condition. Within thirty days of the first stated meeting
  of  the  council  following  the receipt of such notice, the council may
  disapprove the proposed notification.
