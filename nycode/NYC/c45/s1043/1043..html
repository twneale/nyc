Section 1043.

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  1043.  Rulemaking.  a. Authority. Each agency is empowered to adopt
  rules necessary to carry out the powers and duties delegated to it by or
  pursuant to federal, state or local law. No agency shall  adopt  a  rule
  except pursuant to this section. Each such rule shall be simply written,
  using ordinary language where possible.
    b.  Notice. 1. Each agency shall publish the full text of the proposed
  rule in the City Record at least thirty days prior to the date set for a
  public hearing to be held pursuant to the requirements of subdivision  e
  of  this  section  or  the  final  date for receipt of written comments,
  whichever is earlier. A proposed rule amending an  existing  rule  shall
  contain  in brackets any part to be deleted and shall have underlined or
  italicized any new part to  be  added.  A  proposed  rule  repealing  an
  existing  rule  shall contain in brackets the rule to be repealed, or if
  the full text of the rule was published in the Compilation  required  to
  be published pursuant to section one thousand forty-five, shall give the
  citation  of the rule to be repealed and a summary of its contents. Such
  published notice shall include  a  draft  statement  of  the  basis  and
  purpose  of  the  proposed  rule, the statutory authority, including the
  particular sections and subdivisions upon which the action is based, the
  time and place of public hearing, if any, to be held or the reason  that
  a  public  hearing  will  not be held, and the final date for receipt of
  written  comments.  If  the  proposed  rule  was  not  included  in  the
  regulatory  agenda,  such  notice shall also include the reason the rule
  was not anticipated,  as  required  in  subdivision  c  of  section  one
  thousand forty-two of this chapter.
    2.   Copies   of   the  full  text  of  the  proposed  rule  shall  be
  electronically transmitted to the office of the speaker of the  council,
  the  council's office of legislative documents, the corporation counsel,
  each council member, the chairs of all community boards, the news  media
  and  civic  organizations  no  later  than the date the proposed rule is
  transmitted to the City Record for publication pursuant to paragraph one
  of subdivision b of this section; provided that an  inadvertent  failure
  to fully comply with the notice requirements of this paragraph shall not
  serve to invalidate any rule.
    3. (a) News media, for the purposes of this subdivision, shall include
  (i)  all  radio  and television stations broadcasting in the city of New
  York, all newspapers  published  in  the  city  of  New  York  having  a
  city-wide  or  borough-wide  circulation, and any newspaper of any labor
  union or trade association representing an  industry  affected  by  such
  rule,  and  (ii)  any  community newspaper or any other publication that
  requests such notification on an annual basis.
    (b) Civic organizations, for the purposes of this  subdivision,  shall
  include  any  city-wide or borough-wide organization or any labor union,
  trade association or other group that requests such notification  on  an
  annual basis.
    4.  In addition to the requirements set forth in paragraph one of this
  subdivision, each agency shall provide information regarding the  public
  hearing  to  be  held  with  regard  to  a  proposed rule in a prominent
  location on such agency's website at least seven days prior to the  date
  set  for such hearing. Each agency shall further provide, in a prominent
  location on such agency's website, a link to the NYC Rules online portal
  or any successor city website or page that is substantially  similar  in
  form or function. Each agency shall, to the greatest extent practicable,
  and  in  addition  to the electronic transmissions required by paragraph
  two  of  this  subdivision,  publicize  upcoming  public  hearings   via
  electronic  means  that  are  likely  to reach interested members of the
  public. This paragraph shall not be construed to create a private  right

  of  action to enforce its provisions. Inadvertent failure to comply with
  this paragraph shall not result in the invalidation of any rule.
    c. Review of statutory authority. The corporation counsel shall review
  the  proposed  rule  to  determine  whether  it  is within the authority
  delegated by law to the agency proposing the rule.  If  the  corporation
  counsel  determines  that  the  proposed rule is not within the agency's
  delegated authority, the corporation counsel shall notify the agency  in
  writing prior to the publication of the final rule in the City Record.
    d.  1.  The  law department and the mayor's office of operations shall
  review each proposed rule prior to publication of such proposed rule  in
  the  City  Record.  At  the conclusion of its review, the law department
  shall state whether  each  proposed  rule:  (i)  is  drafted  so  as  to
  accomplish the purpose of the authorizing provisions of law; (ii) is not
  in conflict with other applicable rules; (iii) to the extent practicable
  and  appropriate,  is  narrowly drawn to achieve its stated purpose; and
  (iv) to the extent practicable and appropriate, contains a statement  of
  basis  and purpose that provides a clear explanation of the rule and the
  requirements imposed by the rule. As part of  its  review,  the  mayor's
  office  of  operations  shall  analyze each proposed rule and state: (a)
  whether such rule is understandable and written in plain  language;  (b)
  how  the  drafting  process  of  the rule, to the extent practicable and
  appropriate, included analysis sufficient  to  minimize  the  compliance
  costs for the discrete regulated community or communities, to the extent
  one  exists,  consistent  with achieving the stated purpose of the rule;
  and (c) why, in the event such rule  involves  the  establishment  of  a
  violation,  modification of a violation or modification of the penalties
  associated with a violation without also including  a  cure  period,  or
  other  opportunity  for  ameliorative  action  by  the  party or parties
  subject to enforcement,  such  cure  period  or  other  opportunity  for
  ameliorative  action  was  not  included. Provided, however, that if the
  proposed rule solely establishes or modifies the amount  of  a  monetary
  penalty  or penalties then the law department statement required by this
  paragraph shall not be required  and  the  analysis  of  the  office  of
  operations  may  be  limited  to  the reason or reasons a cure period or
  other opportunity for ameliorative action was not included.
    2. After completing the review as set forth in paragraph one  of  this
  subdivision,  the  law  department  and the mayor's office of operations
  shall certify that they have performed such review, and  shall  promptly
  transmit  a copy of such certification, including the analysis performed
  by the mayor's office of operations, to the relevant agency. Such agency
  shall annex such certification and analysis to  the  full  text  of  the
  proposed  rule  as  published in the City Record. Such certification and
  analysis shall also be made  available  to  the  public  on  the  city's
  website  and  transmitted to the speaker of the city council at the time
  of publication. In no event shall  a  proposed  rule  be  submitted  for
  initial publication in the City Record unless the law department and the
  mayor's   office  of  operations  have  issued  such  certification  and
  analysis.
    3. This subdivision shall not be construed to create a  private  right
  of  action to enforce its provisions. Inadvertent failure to comply with
  this subdivision shall not result in the invalidation of any rule.
    4. This subdivision shall not apply to rules that: (i) are promulgated
  pursuant to the emergency procedures set forth in subdivision i of  this
  section;   (ii)   are   solely   concerned  with  the  establishment  or
  modification of the amount of a monetary penalty or penalties,  and  the
  underlying  violation or a modification of the penalties associated with
  such violation has previously been analyzed in accordance with paragraph
  one  of  this  subdivision;  (iii)  are  solely   concerned   with   the

  establishment  or  modification  of  the amount of a fee or fees or (iv)
  implement particular mandates or standards set forth  in  newly  enacted
  federal,  state,  or  local laws, regulations or other requirements with
  only  minor,  if any, exercise of agency discretion in interpreting such
  mandates or standards.  If  an  analysis  of  a  proposed  rule  is  not
  performed  pursuant to the exceptions noted in this paragraph, such fact
  shall be noted and the note annexed to the full  text  of  the  proposed
  rule as published in the City Record.
    e. Opportunity for and consideration of agency and public comment. The
  agency  shall  provide  the  public  an  opportunity  to  comment on the
  proposed rule (i) through outreach to the discrete  regulated  community
  or  communities,  if  one exists, provided that this clause shall not be
  construed  to  create  a  private  right  of  action  to  enforce   this
  requirement;   (ii)  through  submission  of  written  data,  views,  or
  arguments, and (iii) at a public hearing unless it is determined by  the
  agency  in  writing,  which shall be published in the notice of proposed
  rulemaking in the City Record, that such a public hearing on a  proposed
  rule  would  serve no public purpose. All written comments and a summary
  of oral comments concerning a proposed rule received from the public  or
  any  agency  shall  be  placed  in  a  public record and be made readily
  available to the public as soon as practicable and in any event within a
  reasonable time, not to be delayed because of the continued pendency  of
  consideration  of the proposed rule. After consideration of the relevant
  comments presented, the agency  may  adopt  a  final  rule  pursuant  to
  subdivision  f  of  this section; except that, other than a rule adopted
  pursuant to subdivision i of  this  section,  no  final  rule  shall  be
  adopted  by such board or commission unless its final language is posted
  in a prominent location on  such  agency's  website  and  electronically
  transmitted  to  each  member of such board or commission at least three
  calendar days, exclusive of Sundays,  prior  to  such  rule's  adoption;
  provided,  however,  that  revisions  may  be made to a final rule posed
  online and sent electronically in conformity with  this  subdivision  at
  any  time  prior to the vote on such rule if such revisions are approved
  by all members of such board or commission by  unanimous  consent.  Such
  final rule may include revisions of the proposed rule, and such adoption
  of  revisions  based  on  the consideration of relevant agency or public
  comments shall not require further notice and comment pursuant  to  this
  section. This paragraph shall not be construed to create a private right
  of  action to enforce its provisions. Inadvertent failure to comply with
  this paragraph shall not result in the invalidation of any rule.
    f. Effective date. 1. No rule shall be effective until
    (a) the rule is filed by the agency with the corporation  counsel  for
  publication in the Compilation,
    (b)  the  rule  and a statement of basis and purpose is transmitted to
  the council for its information, and
    (c) the rule and a statement of basis and purpose have been  published
  in  the City Record and thirty days have elapsed after such publication.
  The  requirement  that  thirty  days  shall  first  elapse  after   such
  publication  shall not apply where a finding that a substantial need for
  the earlier implementation of a program or policy has been made  by  the
  agency  in  writing  and  has  been  approved  by the mayor prior to the
  effective date of the rule and such finding and approval is contained in
  the notice.
    2. A rule shall be void if it is not published in the next  supplement
  to  the  Compilation  in which its publication is practicable; provided,
  however, that in the case of an inadvertent failure to publish a rule in
  such supplement, the rule shall become effective as of the date  of  its
  publication,  if  it  is  published  within  six  months of the date the

  corporation  counsel  receives  notice  of  its  omission;  and  further
  provided  that  any  judicial  or  administrative  action or proceeding,
  whether criminal or civil, commenced under or by virtue of any provision
  of  a  rule  voided  pursuant  to this section and pending prior to such
  voidance, may be prosecuted and defended to final  effect  in  the  same
  manner as they might if such rule had not been so voided.
    g.  Petition  for rules. Any person may petition an agency to consider
  the adoption of any rule. Within sixty days after the  submission  of  a
  petition, the agency shall either deny such petition in writing, stating
  the  reasons  for  denial,  or  state the agency's intention to initiate
  rulemaking,  by  a  specified  date,  concerning  the  subject  of  such
  petition.  Each  agency  shall  prescribe  by  rule  the  procedure  for
  submission, consideration and disposition of such petitions. In the case
  of a board, commission or other body that is  not  headed  by  a  single
  person,  such  rules of procedure may authorize such body to delegate to
  its chair the authority to reject such petitions. Such decision shall be
  within the discretion of the agency and shall not be subject to judicial
  review.
    h. Maintenance of comments. Each agency shall establish a  system  for
  maintaining  and  making  available  for  public  inspection all written
  comments received in response to each notice of rulemaking.
    i. Emergency procedures. 1. Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of
  this section, an agency may adopt a rule prior to the notice and comment
  otherwise  required  by  this  section if the immediate effectiveness of
  such rule is necessary to address an imminent threat to health,  safety,
  property  or  a necessary service. A finding of such imminent threat and
  the specific reasons for the finding must be  made  in  writing  by  the
  agency adopting such rule and shall be approved by the mayor before such
  rule  may be made effective. In the event that an elected official other
  than the mayor has the authority to promulgate rules, such official  may
  make  such  findings  without  prior  mayoral  approval.  The  rule  and
  accompanying finding  shall  be  made  public  forthwith  and  shall  be
  published in the City Record as soon as practicable. Agencies shall also
  electronically  transmit  all  emergency  rules adopted pursuant to this
  paragraph to the office of the speaker of  the  council,  the  council's
  office  of  legislative documents, the corporation counsel, each council
  member, the chairs of all community boards, the  news  media  and  civic
  organizations, as such term is defined in subdivision b of this section,
  no  later  than the date the emergency rules are transmitted to the City
  Record for publication pursuant to this paragraph.
    2. A rule adopted on an emergency basis shall not remain in effect for
  longer than sixty days  unless  the  agency  has  initiated  notice  and
  comment  otherwise required by this section within such sixty day period
  and publishes with such notice a statement that  an  extension  of  such
  rule  on an emergency basis is necessary for an additional sixty days to
  afford an opportunity for notice and comment and to adopt a  final  rule
  as required by this section; provided that no further such finding of an
  emergency  may  be  made  with  respect  to  the same or a substantially
  similar rule.
