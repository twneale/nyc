Section 1042.

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  1042.  Regulatory agenda. a. Each agency shall publish by the first
  day of May annually, a regulatory agenda which shall contain:
    1. a brief description of the subject areas in which it is anticipated
  that rules may be promulgated during the next fiscal year,  including  a
  description of the reasons why action by the agency is being considered;
    2. a summary, to the extent known, of the anticipated contents of each
  such proposed rule, its objectives and legal basis;
    3. a description of the types of individuals and entities likely to be
  subject to the rule;
    4.  an  identification,  to  the  extent  practicable, of all relevant
  federal, state, and local laws and  rules,  including  those  which  may
  duplicate, overlap or conflict with the proposed rule; and
    5.  an  approximate  schedule  for adopting the proposed rule, and the
  name and telephone number of an agency official knowledgeable about each
  subject area involved.
    b. Each agency the single head of which  is  appointed  by  the  mayor
  shall forward to the mayor its regulatory agenda. The mayor shall review
  such  regulatory agenda to determine whether regulations contemplated by
  city  agencies  are  consistent  with  the  policy  objectives  of   the
  administration.
    c.  Failure  to  include  an  item  in  a  regulatory agenda shall not
  preclude action thereon. If rulemaking is undertaken  on  a  matter  not
  included in the regulatory agenda the agency shall include in the notice
  of  proposed  rulemaking  the  reason  the rule was not anticipated. The
  inadvertent failure to provide the reason such rule was not included  in
  the regulatory agenda shall not serve to invalidate the rule.
