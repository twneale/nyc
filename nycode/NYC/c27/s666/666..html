    1.  To  make, amend and repeal rules and regulations for carrying into

  from,  or fire protection in, all buildings within the city, which shall
  take the place of the industrial code and of any rules  and  regulations
  of the department of labor of the state of New York relating to the same
  subject-matter.
    3.  To  make,  amend  and  repeal  rules,  regulations  and directives
  governing the preparation and presentation by the  director  of  matters

  the state of New York elsewhere in the state.
    5. To determine and vary the application of the zoning  resolution  as
  may  be  provided in such resolution and pursuant to section six hundred
  sixty-eight.
    6. To hear and decide appeals from and review,
    (a) except as otherwise  provided  by  law,  any  order,  requirement,

  deputy commissioner  of  buildings  or  any  borough  superintendent  of
  buildings   acting   under  a  written  delegation  of  power  from  the
  commissioner of buildings filed in accordance  with  the  provisions  of
  section  six hundred forty-two or section six hundred forty-five of this
  charter, or
    (b) any order, requirement, decision  or  determination  of  the  fire
  commissioner  or  any  rule or regulation or amendment or repeal thereof
  made by the fire commissioner, or
    (c)  any  order,  requirement,  decision  or  determination   of   the
  commissioner  of  transportation  or the commissioner of ports and trade

  regulation,  decision  or  determination appealed from, and to make such
  order, requirement, decision or determination as in its opinion ought to

  or  the  provisions  of  any  law  relating  to  the  construction, use,
  structural changes, equipment, alteration or  removal  of  buildings  or
  structures,  or vaults in sidewalks appurtenant thereto, where there are
  practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship in the  way  of  carrying
  out the strict letter of the law, so that the spirit of the law shall be
  observed,  public  safety secured and substantial justice done, provided

  that  the  provisions  of  the  housing  maintenance  code  and  of  any

  regulation, amendment or repeal thereof,  and  any  order,  requirement,
  decision or determination from which an appeal may be taken to the board
  under  the  provisions  of  this  chapter or of any law, or of any rule,
  regulation or decision of the board; but no such review shall  prejudice
  the  rights  of any person who has in good faith acted thereon before it
  is reversed or modified. The provisions  of  this  chapter  relating  to
  appeals to the board shall be applicable to such review.
    9. To afford an equal right to the city planning commission, community
  boards,  and borough boards and lessees and tenants as well as owners to

  evidence  in  respect  of  any  matter brought before it pursuant to the
