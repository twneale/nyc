    &sect;  669.  Procedure on appeals. a. An appeal may be taken by any person
  aggrieved or by the head of any agency.
    b. Such appeal may be taken within such time as shall be prescribed by
  the board by general rule, by filing with  the  officer  from  whom  the
  appeal  is  taken  and with the board a notice of appeal, specifying the
  grounds thereof.   The officer from  whom  the  appeal  is  taken  shall
  forthwith  transmit  to the board all the papers constituting the record
  upon which the action appealed from was taken.
    c. The board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing  of  appeals,
  and give due notice thereof to the parties, and decide the same within a
  reasonable  time.  If  the  appeal is from an order revoking a permit or
  approval, the hearing shall be had no later than at the third  scheduled
  hearing of the board following the date of filing of the appeal, or five
  weeks  following such date, whichever is sooner, and the decision of the
  board shall be rendered expeditiously.  Upon the hearing any  party  may
  appear in person or by agent or attorney.
    d.  Any  decision  of  the board under this section may be reviewed in
  accordance with section 25-207 of the administrative code of the city of
  New York.
