    &sect;  1052.  Campaign  finance  board.  a.   1. There shall be a campaign
  finance board consisting of five members.   Two  members  of  the  board
  shall  be  appointed  by the mayor, provided that not more than one such
  member shall be enrolled in any one political  party,  and  two  members
  shall be appointed by the speaker of the council, provided that not more
  than  one  such member shall be enrolled in any one political party, and
  one member, who shall be the chairperson,  shall  be  appointed  by  the
  mayor  after  consultation  with the speaker. The members shall first be
  appointed to serve as follows:
    (a) one member appointed by the speaker for a term of one year;
    (b) one member appointed by the mayor for a term of two years;
    (c) one member appointed by the speaker for a term of three years;
    (d) one member appointed by the mayor for a term of four years; and
    (e) the chairperson for a term of five years.
    The first  term  shall  commence  on  April  first,  nineteen  hundred
  eighty-eight.  Thereafter,  each member shall be appointed, by the mayor
  or the speaker, according to the original manner of appointment,  for  a
  term  of five years that shall, for any term beginning on or after March
  first two thousand eleven, commence on December first. Terms that  began
  before,  and have not expired on, March first, two thousand eleven shall
  be extended and shall expire on the November thirtieth  following  their
  original  March  thirty-first  expiration  dates. Upon expiration of the
  term of a member, if the mayor or the  speaker,  as  appropriate,  shall
  fail  to  appoint  a  member  within  one  hundred  twenty  days  of the
  expiration of such term, the member whose  term  has  expired  shall  be
  deemed  appointed  for  an  additional  term  of  five  years, provided,
  however, that if the expiration of such term occurs in a year  in  which
  elections,  except special elections, covered by the voluntary system of
  campaign finance reform are scheduled, the member whose term has expired
  shall be deemed appointed for an additional term of five  years  if  the
  mayor  or  the  speaker,  as appropriate, shall fail to appoint a member
  within ninety days of the expiration of such term. In case of a  vacancy
  in  the  office  of  a  member, a member shall be appointed to serve the
  remainder of the unexpired term by the mayor or the  speaker,  according
  to  the  original manner of appointment. If the mayor or the speaker, as
  appropriate, shall fail to appoint a member within  one  hundred  eighty
  days  of  such vacancy, then a member shall be appointed by the board to
  serve for the remainder  of  the  unexpired  term,  if  additional  time
  remains  in such term, provided, however, that if such vacancy occurs in
  a year, or within ninety days prior  to  a  year,  in  which  elections,
  except  special  elections,  covered by the voluntary system of campaign
  finance reform are scheduled, then a member shall be  appointed  by  the
  board  to  serve  for the remainder of the unexpired term, if additional
  time remains in such term, if the mayor or the speaker, as  appropriate,
  shall  fail  to  appoint  a  member  within ninety days of such vacancy.
  Except for the chairperson, such member shall not  be  enrolled  in  the
  same  political  party as the other member appointed by the official who
  failed to so appoint. Each member shall  be  a  resident  of  the  city,
  registered  to  vote  therein.  Each  member  shall  agree  not  to make
  contributions to any candidate for nomination for election, or election,
  to the office of mayor, public advocate, comptroller, borough president,
  or member of the council which in the aggregate are  in  excess  of  the
  maximum contribution applicable to such office pursuant to any local law
  establishing  a  voluntary  system of campaign finance reform. No member
  shall serve as an officer of a political party, or be  a  candidate,  or
  participate in any capacity in a campaign by a candidate, for nomination
  for  election  or  election  to  the  office  of mayor, public advocate,
  comptroller, borough president or member of the city  council.  Officers

  and employees of the city or any city agency, lobbyists required to file
  a  statement  of  registration under section 3-213 of the administrative
  code and the employees of such lobbyists shall not  be  eligible  to  be
  members  of the board. In appointing members to the board, the mayor and
  the  speaker  shall  consider  campaign  experience   in   general   and
  particularly campaign experience with the New York city campaign finance
  system.  Members  of  the  board  shall  be required to undergo training
  developed pursuant to paragraph 14 of this section.
    2. The members of the board shall be compensated at the  rate  of  one
  hundred dollars per calendar day when performing the work of the board.
    3.  The  board  may  employ  necessary  staff,  including an executive
  director and a counsel,  and  make  necessary  expenditures  subject  to
  appropriation.
    4.  No  member  of  the  campaign  finance board shall be removed from
  office except for cause and upon notice and hearing.
    5. The board shall have the power to investigate all matters  relating
  to the performance of its functions and any other matter relating to the
  proper administration of any voluntary system of campaign finance reform
  established  by  local law and for such purposes shall have the power to
  require the attendance and examine and take the testimony under oath  of
  such persons as it shall deem necessary and to require the production of
  books,   accounts,   papers   and   other   evidence  relative  to  such
  investigation.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision   of   law,   the
  investigative  and adjudicatory powers and functions of the staff to the
  board shall be separate and no staff member of the board  shall  perform
  both investigative and adjudicatory tasks or functions.
    6.  The  board  shall publicize, as it deems appropriate, the names of
  candidates for nomination or election to the  office  of  mayor,  public
  advocate,  comptroller,  borough  president, or city council who violate
  any of the provisions of any voluntary system of campaign finance reform
  established by local law.
    7. The board may render advisory opinions with  respect  to  questions
  arising  under any local law establishing a voluntary system of campaign
  finance reform. Such advisory opinions may be rendered  on  the  written
  request of a candidate, an officer of a political committee or member of
  the  public,  or  may be rendered on its own initiative. The board shall
  make public its advisory opinions. The board shall develop a program for
  informing candidates and the public as to the purpose and effect of  the
  provisions   of   any   voluntary  system  of  campaign  finance  reform
  established by local law.
    8. The board shall have the authority to  promulgate  such  rules  and
  provide  such  forms as it deems necessary for the administration of any
  voluntary system of campaign finance reform established  by  local  law.
  The  board  shall  promulgate  regulations  concerning the form in which
  contributions and expenditures are to be reported,  the  periods  during
  which  such  reports  must  be  filed and the verification required. The
  board  shall  require  the  filing  of  reports  of  contributions   and
  expenditures   for   purposes   of   determining   compliance  with  any
  contribution or  expenditure  limitations  provided  in  any  local  law
  establishing  a  voluntary  system  of campaign finance reform, provided
  that the schedule established by the board for such filings shall be  in
  accordance  with  the schedule specified by the state board of elections
  for the filing of campaign receipt and expenditure statements.
    9. The board shall develop a computer data base that shall contain all
  information necessary for the  proper  administration  of  this  chapter
  including information on contributions to and expenditures by candidates
  and  their  authorized  committees  and distributions of moneys from the

  campaign finance funds. Such  data  base  shall  be  accessible  to  the
  public.
    10.  The board may take such other actions as are necessary and proper
  to carry out the purposes of any  local  law  establishing  a  voluntary
  system  of campaign finance reform. If at any time, the board determines
  that the amount of money in any special fund or funds established by any
  such local law, establishing a  voluntary  system  of  campaign  finance
  reform,  to  fund  a  system  of  optional public campaign financing for
  candidates abiding by the requirements of such law, is insufficient,  or
  is  likely  to  be  insufficient,  for  payment  to  such  participating
  candidates pursuant to such law, it shall report this  determination  to
  the  commissioner  of finance, along with its estimate of the additional
  amount which will be necessary to provide such participating  candidates
  with  financing  pursuant  to  such  law and a detailed statement of the
  assumptions and methodologies on which such estimate is based. Not  more
  than  four  days after receiving such estimate and supporting materials,
  the commissioner of finance shall  transfer  an  amount  equal  to  such
  estimate from the general fund to such special fund or funds. All monies
  transferred  to  such  special  fund  or  funds  shall not be considered
  revenues of the city and payments from such fund or funds shall be  made
  without appropriation and shall not be included in the expense budget of
  the  city.  The  comptroller shall have custody of such fund or funds on
  behalf of the board and shall have the power to  invest  the  monies  of
  such  fund  or  funds  in  the manner in which the city is authorized to
  invest its funds and shall deposit the monies of the fund  or  funds  in
  such  deposit  banks  as  have been designated by the banking commission
  pursuant to section fifteen hundred twenty-four  of  this  charter.  The
  comptroller  shall  submit  monthly  reports  to the board regarding the
  status of the fund or funds and more frequent  reports  when  the  board
  requires.  Monies  of  the  fund  or  funds  shall  be  paid  out by the
  comptroller only on warrant of the board.
    11. The board  shall  have  the  authority  to  implement  any  system
  established  for the regulation of inauguration and transition donations
  and expenditures including the promulgation of rules and regulations and
  the imposition of any penalties related thereto, as  required  by  local
  law.
    12.  (a)  The board shall require that candidates participating in the
  voluntary system of campaign finance reform or candidates who  otherwise
  file  disclosure  reports with the board shall disclose to the board the
  acceptance of campaign contributions from individuals and entities doing
  business with the city. The board shall  promulgate  such  rules  as  it
  deems  necessary  to implement and administer this provision and provide
  that information regarding such contributions shall be accessible to the
  public. The board shall also promulgate such rules as it deems necessary
  to regulate the acceptance by candidates participating in the  voluntary
  system  of  campaign  finance  reform  of  campaign  contributions  from
  individuals and entities doing business with the city,  including  rules
  that  determine  which business dealings shall be covered by such rules.
  Elected officials, city agencies, boards and commissions, including  the
  mayor,  comptroller,  public  advocate,  borough  presidents,  the  city
  council and members of the city council shall cooperate with  the  board
  to  provide  to  the  board  such information about such individuals and
  entities as the board shall require.
    (b) The board shall promulgate such rules as  it  deems  necessary  to
  attribute  expenditures  that  indirectly  assist or benefit a candidate
  participating in the voluntary system  of  campaign  finance  reform  as
  in-kind contributions to such candidate.

    (c)  In promulgating rules pursuant to this paragraph, the board shall
  consider the following criteria: (1) the effectiveness of the  voluntary
  system of campaign finance reform, (2) the costs of such system, (3) the
  maintenance  of  a reasonable balance between the burdens of such system
  and the incentives to candidates to participate in such system.
    (d)  Any rules promulgated pursuant to this paragraph shall apply only
  with respect to nomination for election, or election, to the  office  of
  mayor, public advocate, comptroller, borough president, or member of the
  city council.
    (e)  Proposed  rules  promulgated  pursuant to this paragraph shall be
  published in accordance with  subdivision  b  of  section  one  thousand
  forty-three  of  this  charter  no  later  than  December  thirty-first,
  nineteen hundred ninety-nine. Final rules promulgated pursuant  to  this
  paragraph  shall  be  adopted in accordance with such section as soon as
  practicable thereafter. Final rules adopted in the initial  promulgation
  of  rules  pursuant  to  this paragraph shall supersede any inconsistent
  provisions of  the  administrative  code  that  are  in  effect  on  the
  effective date of such final rules.
    13.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  law,  the board shall
  prohibit candidates for offices  covered  by  the  voluntary  system  of
  campaign finance reform from accepting, either directly or indirectly, a
  campaign  contribution, loan, guarantee or other security for such loan,
  from any corporation. The board shall promulgate such rules as it  deems
  necessary to implement and administer this provision.
    14  a.  The  council  and  the mayor, in conjunction with the campaign
  finance board, shall develop a curriculum to be used to train members of
  the campaign finance board and staff. Such curriculum shall include  the
  issues  and  problems confronted by campaigns for covered office and how
  the application and enforcement of  the  city's  campaign  finance  laws
  impacts these campaigns.
    15. (a) For purposes of this paragraph, the following terms shall have
  the following meanings:
    (i)  "Independent  expenditure"  shall  mean  a  monetary  or  in-kind
  expenditure made, or liability incurred, in support of or in  opposition
  to  a  candidate  in  a covered election or municipal ballot proposal or
  referendum, where no candidate, nor any  agent  or  political  committee
  authorized   by  a  candidate,  has  authorized,  requested,  suggested,
  fostered or cooperated in  any  such  activity.  The  term  "independent

  volunteers his or her personal services, to the extent such expenses are
  unreimbursed and do not exceed five hundred dollars in value,

    (c) Any literature, advertisement or other communication in support of
  or in opposition to any candidate in any covered election that  is  paid
  for   by   an  individual  or  entity  making  independent  expenditures
  aggregating one thousand dollars or more shall disclose the name of  any
  individual or entity making the expenditure.
    (d)  The  board  may,  upon notice and opportunity to be heard, assess

  each  violation  of this paragraph. The intentional or knowing violation
  of this paragraph shall be punishable as a misdemeanor  in  addition  to
  any other penalty provided under law.
    (e) The board shall promulgate rules concerning the form and manner in
  which  independent  expenditures  are  to be reported and disclosed, the
  information to be reported  and  disclosed,  the  periods  during  which
  reports  must  be  filed, and the verification required. The board shall

  promulgate such additional rules as it  deems  necessary  to  implement,

  such  rules  that  information  regarding  independent  expenditures  be
  promptly  made  accessible  to  the  public  during the covered election
  cycle.
    b. The board shall  take  such  actions  as  it  deems  necessary  and

  or city council or  ballot  proposals  or  referenda  pursuant  to  this
  charter  or  the  municipal home rule law, including but not necessarily
  limited to the publication of a  non-partisan,  impartial  voters  guide
  providing information on candidates, ballot proposals and referenda, and
  the  distribution  of  one copy of such guide to each household in which
  there is at least one registered voter eligible to vote in the  election
  involved.  In  any  year in which the board publishes a voters guide, if
  the board  determines  that  the  amount  of  money  in  its  budget  is
  insufficient  or  likely  to  be  insufficient  for  the publication and
  distribution of the voters guide, it shall report such determination  to
  the  director  of  the  office  of  management  and  budget,  who, after
  consultation with the board, shall, without an  appropriation,  transfer
  to  the  board  a reasonable amount, as the director shall determine, to
  cover the cost of publishing and distributing the voters guide.
    c. The board shall, not later than March tenth of each  year,  approve
  and  submit  to  the  mayor detailed itemized estimates of the financial
  needs of the campaign finance board for the ensuing  fiscal  year.  Such
  estimates  shall  be  comprised of at least one personal service unit of
  appropriation and at least one  other  than  personal  service  unit  of
  appropriation.  The  mayor shall include such estimates in the executive
  budget without revision, but with such recommendations as the mayor  may
  deem  proper.  Upon  inclusion  in  the  executive  budget,  the  budget
  submitted by the campaign finance board shall  be  adopted  pursuant  to
  such  provisions of chapter ten of this charter as are applicable to the
  operating budget of the council.
    d. The board may take such other actions as are necessary  and  proper
  to  carry  out  any  other  authority the city council shall give to the
  board in any local law, including the promulgation of any rules and  the
  provision of any forms.
    e.  The  board  shall  take  such  actions  as  it deems necessary and
  appropriate to encourage, promote, and facilitate voter registration and
  voting by all residents of New York  City  who  are  eligible  to  vote,
  including,   but   not  necessarily  limited  to  the  employment  of  a
  coordinator of voter assistance and other  necessary  staff.  The  board
  shall have authority to promulgate rules in order to implement the voter
  assistance  provisions  of  this  chapter,  except  that  any rules with
  respect to city agency  operations  concerning  voter  registration  and
  voting,  including  but  not  limited  to  implementation of section one
  thousand fifty-seven-a, shall be promulgated  in  conjunction  with  the
