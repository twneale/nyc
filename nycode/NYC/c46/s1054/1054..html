    &sect; 1054. Voter assistance advisory committee. a. There shall be a voter
  assistance  advisory  committee  consisting of nine members, which shall
  assist the  board  with  its  duties  and  responsibilities  under  this
  chapter,  including  but  not limited to overseeing the voter assistance
  program established by this chapter. Two members shall be  appointed  by
  the mayor, provided that not more than one such member shall be enrolled
  in  any  one  political  party;  two  members  shall be appointed by the
  speaker of the city council, provided that not more than one such member
  shall be enrolled in any  one  political  party;  one  member  shall  be
  appointed  by  the  comptroller;  one  member  shall be appointed by the
  borough presidents acting together; and one member shall be appointed by
  the mayor in consultation with the speaker and shall serve as chair.  In
  addition,  the committee shall include the public advocate, or in his or
  her absence, a representative, and the executive director of  the  board
  of  elections  (or, in his or her absence, the deputy executive director
  of the board of elections). In appointing members to the committee,  the
  mayor,  speaker,  comptroller  and  borough  presidents  shall  consider
  experience  with  groups   or   categories   of   residents   that   are
  underrepresented  among those who vote or among those who are registered
  to vote and community, voter registration, civil  rights,  and  disabled
  groups.  The  appointed  members  shall  first  be appointed to serve as
  follows:
    1. one member appointed by the speaker for a term of one year;
    2. one member appointed by the mayor for a term of two years;
    3. one member appointed by the speaker for a term of three years;
    4. one member appointed by the mayor for a term of four years;
    5. one member appointed by the comptroller for a term of four years;
    6. one member appointed by the borough presidents for a term  of  five
  years; and
    7.  the chair, appointed by the mayor in consultation with the speaker
  for a term of five years.
    Each term shall  commence  on  January  first,  two  thousand  eleven.
  Thereafter,  each  member  shall  be  appointed for a term of five years
  according to the original manner of appointment. Upon expiration of  the
  term  of a member, if the appointing official or officials shall fail to
  appoint a member within one hundred twenty days  of  the  expiration  of
  such  term,  the member whose term has expired shall be deemed appointed
  for an additional term of five years. In case of a vacancy in the office
  of an appointed member, a member shall be appointed  to  serve  for  the
  remainder  of  the  unexpired  term  according to the original manner of
  appointment. For appointees of the mayor or speaker, such  member  shall
  not  be  enrolled  in  the  same  political  party  as  the other member
  appointed by the official making the appointment to  fill  the  vacancy.
  Each member shall be a resident of the city, registered to vote therein.
  No  member other than the public advocate shall serve as an officer of a
  political party, or be a candidate, or participate in any capacity in  a
  campaign  by a candidate, for nomination for election or election to the
  office of mayor, public  advocate,  comptroller,  borough  president  or
  member  of  the  city  council. The members of the committee shall serve
  without compensation.

  city agencies and institutions;  mailings  by  city  agencies  to  reach
  citizens;  cooperative  efforts  with  non-partisan  voter  registration
  groups,  community  boards,  agencies  of  city,  state,   and   federal
  governments,  and  entities  doing  business  in the city; publicity and
  other efforts to educate youth about the importance  of  voting  and  to
  encourage  eligible  youth  to  register  to  vote;  and  other outreach

    4. make such recommendations as it deems appropriate to the mayor, the

  of New York City who are eligible to vote;
    5. undertake, by itself or in cooperation with other public or private

  registration and voter participation in New York City. Any member of the
  board may attend and participate in committee meetings and hearings.
