  for  proposals  and  evaluate responses thereto, negotiate, award, enter
  into and administer contracts, loans  or  other  agreements,  award  and

  include,  but  not  be  limited  to,  the  number of contacts during the
  reporting period, the  number  of  placements  in  transitional  housing
  resulting  from such contacts during the reporting period and the number
  of referrals of persons so contacted to programs or services during  the
  reporting period;
