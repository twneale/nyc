Section 2704.

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  2704.  Coterminality of local services. a.  The head of each agency
  responsible for one or more of the services listed below shall  organize
  the local service delivery districts of such agency as follows.
    (1)  To  be  coterminous  with each of the community districts:  local
  parks services; local recreation services; street  cleaning  and  refuse
  collection  services;  the patrol services of the police department; and
  social services, including community  services,  community  development,
  youth  services,  child  development, and special services for children;
  and
    (2) To  be  coterminous  with  one  or  more  community  districts  or
  aggregates  of  them:  housing  code  enforcement,  highway  and  street
  maintenance  and  repair,  sewer  maintenance  and  repair,  and  health
  services, other than municipal hospitals.
    b.    Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision a, the requirement
  that patrol services of the police department be coterminous  with  each
  of  the  community  districts  in  any  borough  shall  not apply to any
  community district where the mayor, after consultation with  the  police
  commissioner,  shall  determine that establishment of such coterminality
  would be inconsistent with the most effective delivery of such services.
  The mayor shall promptly notify the council of any  such  determination,
  and  the  council  may,  by majority vote, disapprove such determination
  with respect to any community district within sixty days after the first
  stated meeting of the council following the receipt of such  notice.  If
  the  council  shall  disapprove  such  determination with respect to any
  community  district,  the  police  commissioner  shall  organize  patrol
  services to be coterminous with such district within ninety days of such
  disapproval.
    c. The council, by resolution subject to the approval of the mayor, or
  the  mayor by executive order, may direct that city services in addition
  to those specified in subdivision a of this section be made  coterminous
  with one or more community districts or aggregates of them.
    d.  The head of each agency whose local service delivery districts are
  not required to be coterminous  with  community  districts  pursuant  to
  subdivision  a  or  c  of  this section shall organize the local service
  delivery districts of the agency to coincide as closely as  possible  to
  the boundaries of the community districts.
    e.  For purposes of this section, coterminality of services shall mean
  that the boundaries of  the  local  service  districts  of  each  agency
  service  listed  in  subdivision  a  or  required to be made coterminous
  pursuant  to  subdivision  c  shall  coincide  with  the  boundaries  of
  community districts.
    f.    The  head  of  each  agency  responsible  for one or more of the
  services listed in subdivision a or  required  to  be  made  coterminous
  pursuant  to subdivision c shall:  (1) assign to each such local service
  district  at  least  one  official  with   managerial   responsibilities
  involving  the  exercise  of  independent  judgment  in  the scheduling,
  allocation and assignment of personnel and equipment and the  evaluation
  of  performance  or  the  management and planning of programs; each such
  official shall have operating or line authority  over  agency  programs,
  personnel  and  facilities within the local service district; (2) assign
  to each borough at least one borough commissioner, or official  with  an
  equivalent  title,  who  shall have line authority over agency programs,
  personnel and facilities within the borough related  to  such  services;
  such  official  shall  consult  regularly with the borough president and
  shall be a member of the borough service cabinet established pursuant to
  section twenty-seven  hundred  six  of  the  charter;  and  (3)  publish
  semi-annually  in  the  City  Record  and  make  available to interested
  parties a list, by community district and borough, of the  name,  title,

  office  mailing  address,  and  office telephone number of the officials
  appointed pursuant to paragraphs one and two of this subdivision and  to
  subdivision a of section twenty-seven hundred six.
    g.  The  head  of  any  agency  may  assign  or  reallocate personnel,
  equipment or other  resources  outside  a  community  district  to  meet
  emergency needs, special situations, or temporary conditions.
    h.  Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit any agency from maintaining
  sub-districts within a community district for purposes of efficient  and
  effective  service  delivery so long as the combined sub-districts shall
  coincide  with  the  boundaries  of  the  community  district.   Nothing
  contained in this section shall prevent the establishment of any special
  district  authorized  pursuant  to  federal,  state  or  local  law, the
  boundaries of which do not coincide with the boundaries of  a  community
  district.
    i.  Each borough president may publish an annual report evaluating the
  delivery,  within  the  borough,  of  the  services  which are listed in
  subdivision a, or are  required  to  be  made  coterminous  pursuant  to
  subdivision c, of this section.
    j.  On  or  before the first day of December, nineteen hundred ninety,
  the mayor shall appoint a task force on service delivery, consisting  of
  no  more than ten members, to review the requirements of subdivisions a,
  c and f of this section. Such task force shall include members appointed
  upon the recommendation of the council,  comptroller,  public  advocate,
  and  borough presidents. The membership of the task force shall include,
  but not be limited to, community board members, district  managers,  and
  representatives  of  the  agencies  subject  to the requirements of this
  section. On or before  the  first  day  of  December,  nineteen  hundred
  ninety-two,  the  task  force  shall  submit  a  report to the mayor and
  council summarizing its conclusions and presenting such  recommendations
  for  changes  in  the  list  of  services  made  coterminous pursuant to
  subdivisions a or c, and in the requirements for such services contained
  in subdivision f, as the task force deems appropriate.
    k.  The  mayor  shall  report  biennially  to  the  council   on   the
  implementation  of  the  requirements of this section. Such report shall
  include: (1) an evaluation of the quality of the services  delivered  to
  community  districts  pursuant  to  subdivisions a and c of this section
  during the preceding two fiscal years, (2) a  review  of  the  agencies'
  implementation  of  subdivisions  d  and  f  of  this  section,  and  of
  subdivision  a  of  section  twenty-seven  hundred  six,  and  (3)   any
  recommendations   for   changes   in  the  services  listed  or  in  the
  requirements for those services which the mayor deems appropriate.
