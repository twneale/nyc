    &sect; 2701. Community districts. a.  Each community district shall:
    (1)  Lie within the boundaries of a single borough, except as provided
  in subdivisions d and e of this section,  and  coincide  with  historic,
  geographic   and  identifiable  communities  from  which  the  city  has
  developed;
    (2) Be suitable for the efficient  and  effective  delivery  of  those
  services  of municipal agencies required to be made coterminous with the
  community districts, pursuant to  section  two  thousand  seven  hundred
  four, including particularly the service and districting requirements of
  the police and sanitation departments; and,
    (3)  Be  compact and contiguous and have a population of not more than
  two hundred fifty thousand persons.
    b.  Community districts shall be as nearly equal  in  population  with
  each  other as is possible under the criteria in paragraphs one, two and
  three of subdivision a of this section.
    c. With respect to the city's central business district in the borough
  of Manhattan from fifty-ninth street south, the  council  may  adopt  as
  part  of  the  community district map, districts which shall reflect its
  unique character as the city's  financial,  business  and  entertainment
  center.  In  so  doing,  the  council  shall take into consideration the
  residential, working and other daytime populations as well as the  hotel
  and  transient  or  other  nighttime populations and adhere as nearly as
  possible to the provisions of paragraph three of subdivision a  of  this
  section.
    d.  The  community  district  map  for  the borough of Manhattan shall
  include Roosevelt Island, located in  the  east  river,  as  part  of  a
  community district in the borough of Manhattan, immediately opposite and
  to  the  west of Roosevelt Island.  However, for the purposes of meeting
  the requirements  of  section  twenty-seven  hundred  four  relating  to
  coterminality  of  local  services,  section  twenty-seven  hundred five
  relating to district service cabinets and section  twenty-seven  hundred
  seven relating to agency budget and service statements, Roosevelt Island
  shall  be  deemed included within a community district of the borough of
  Queens immediately opposite and to the east of Roosevelt  Island.    The
  chairperson  of  the community board of the Manhattan community district
  which includes Roosevelt Island, or his or  her  designee,  shall  be  a
  member  of  the  district  service  cabinet  of  each  of  the community
  districts in which  Roosevelt  Island  is  included  in  the  respective
  boroughs.
    e.  The  community  district  map  for  the borough of the Bronx shall
  include that portion of the borough of Manhattan which lies north of the
  Harlem River.
