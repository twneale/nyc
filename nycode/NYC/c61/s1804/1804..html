    &sect;  1804.    Acquisitions  of  real  property.    No  purchase,  lease,
  condemnation or other acquisition of real  property  by  the  department

  respect to the acquisition after the publishing of notice  in  the  City
  Record  at  least  thirty  days  in  advance of such hearing and (2) the
  department shall have received the  approval  of  the  mayor;  provided,
  however, that in the case of an acquisition by purchase or condemnation,
