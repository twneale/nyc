<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  568.  Mental hygiene advisory board. a. (1) There shall be a mental
  hygiene advisory board which shall be advisory to the  commissioner  and
  the  deputy  commissioner for mental hygiene services in the development
  of community mental health, mental retardation, alcoholism and substance
  abuse facilities and services and programs related  thereto.  The  board
  shall   have  separate  subcommittees  for  mental  health,  for  mental
  retardation and  developmental  disabilities,  and  for  alcoholism  and
  substance  abuse.  The  board and its subcommittees shall be constituted
  and their  appointive  members  appointed  and  removed  in  the  manner
  prescribed  for  a  community  services  board  by the provisions of the
  mental hygiene law. Pursuant to the provisions of such law, such members
  may be reappointed without limitation on the number of consecutive terms
  which they may serve.
    (2) Members of the mental hygiene advisory board and its subcommittees
  shall serve thereon without compensation except that each  member  shall
  be  allowed  actual  and  necessary  expenses  to be audited in the same
  manner as other city charges.
    (3) No person shall be ineligible for membership on the board  or  its
  subcommittees  because  such  person  holds  any  other  public  office,
  employment or trust, nor shall any  person  be  made  ineligible  to  or
  forfeit such person's right to any public office, employment or trust by
  reason of such appointment.
    b. (1) Contracts for services and facilities under this chapter may be
  made  with  a  public or private voluntary hospital, clinic, laboratory,
  health, welfare or mental hygiene agency or other  similar  institution,
  notwithstanding  that any member of the board or its subcommittees is an
  officer or employee of such institution or agency or is a member of  the
  medical or consultant staff thereof.
    (2)  If any matter arises before the board or any of its subcommittees
  directly involving a  public  or  private  voluntary  hospital,  clinic,
  laboratory,  health,  welfare  or mental hygiene agency or other similar
  institution of which any member of the board or such subcommittee is  an
  officer,  employee  or  on the medical or consultant staff thereof, that
  member shall participate in the deliberations of the board  or  of  such
  subcommittee  on  the  matter only insofar as to provide any information
  requested  of  such  person  by  the  other  members  of  the  board  or
  subcommittee,  and  that  member  shall  not  participate further in the
  deliberations of the board or subcommittee on the  matter  after  having
  provided the required information.
