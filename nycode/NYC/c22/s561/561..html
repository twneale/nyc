    * &sect;  561.  Permits.  The  board of health in its discretion may grant,
  suspend or revoke permits for businesses or other matters in respect  to
  any  subject  dealt  with  in  the  health  code  and  regulated  by the
  department and may prescribe reasonable fees for the  issuance  of  said
  permits.  Whenever the board of health in the health code authorizes the
  issuance, suspension or revocation of a permit by the commissioner,  his
  action  shall be subject to review by the board of health upon an appeal
  by the party aggrieved under such rules as the board may  provide.  Such
  rules  may  provide  in  what cases an appeal may stay the action of the
  commissioner until final determination  by  the  board  of  health,  but
  notwithstanding  any  such  rule the board of health shall have power to
  grant or refuse a stay in any particular case.
