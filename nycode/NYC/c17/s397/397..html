    &sect;  397.  Delegation of legal authority.  a.  The mayor may delegate to
  any agency, after consultation with the corporation counsel and the head
  of the agency, responsibility for the conduct of routine  legal  affairs
  of  the  agency  subject  to  standards, policies, and guidelines of the
  corporation  counsel,  and  consistent  with  city-wide   controls   and
  uniformity.    The  mayor  may transfer or assign attorneys from the law
  department to the agency to assist in  the  conduct  of  such  delegated
  functions.    The  corporation  counsel  shall monitor and evaluate on a
  regular  and  continuous  basis  the  exercise  of  authority  delegated
  pursuant  to  this  section  and  the  mayor,  on  recommendation of the
  corporation counsel, may suspend or  withdraw  any  delegated  authority
  whenever  in  his or her judgment the interests of the city justify such
  action.
    b.  Nothing contained in this section shall abrogate the authority  of
  the  corporation  counsel as attorney and counsel for the city and every
  agency of the city.
