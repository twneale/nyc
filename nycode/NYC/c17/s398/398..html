Section 398.

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  398.  Ex  parte  administrative warrants. If entry to a location or
  premises to be inspected pursuant to an agency's powers  and  duties  is
  not  gained on consent, or if circumstances call for entry without prior
  notice, the commissioner of  such  agency,  or  his  or  her  authorized
  representative,   may   request  the  corporation  counsel  to  make  an
  application, ex parte, in any court of  competent  jurisdiction  for  an
  order  directing  the  entry and inspection of such premises or location
  and, in accordance with applicable law, to abate any  nuisance  thereon.
  Nothing  in this section shall be construed to limit, abridge, affect or
  amend the power of an agency under law, including state, local  or  case
  law, to enter and inspect any location or premises or abate any nuisance
  thereon,  either  with  or  without  a  warrant, to carry out any of its
  functions, powers and duties.
