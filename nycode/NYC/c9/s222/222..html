    &sect;  222.  Scope  of project. a.  Each agency, with respect to a capital
  project under its jurisdiction  included  in  a  capital  budget,  shall
  prepare  a proposed scope of project within appropriated planning funds.
  In preparing the proposed scope of project,  the  agency  shall  consult
  with the community board for the community district in which the capital
  project is to be located. The proposed scope of project, or, in the case
  of a delay, an explanation for such delay along with a revised schedule,
  shall be submitted to the mayor and to the respective council committee,
  borough  president  and  community  board  by  the date specified in the
  adopted capital budget in which the capital project  is  included.  Such
  proposed  scope  shall  identify all substantial differences between the
  guidelines for the capital project as contained in such  scope  and  the
  description  of  the  capital  project  contained  in  the report issued
  pursuant to subdivision d of section two hundred nineteen  at  the  time
  such  project  was  proposed  in  the  executive budget or following the
  budget adoption in which such project was added to the capital budget.
    b. Not later than sixty days after receipt of the  proposed  scope  of
  project  from  an  agency pursuant to subdivision a of this section, the
  mayor shall approve, modify, or disapprove the proposed scope of project
  and notify the agency, and the  respective  council  committee,  borough
  president  and  community  board. In the case of a scope approved by the
  mayor with modifications, such notification shall include a copy of  the
  scope as approved.
    c.  During  the review of the selection of a site of a capital project
  pursuant to the uniform land use review procedure established by section
  one hundred ninety-seven-c, the community board  and  borough  president
  shall also review, and may comment on, the scope of the project.
    d.  No  scope  of project shall be approved by the mayor unless (1) it
  contains the information required  by  paragraph  four  of  section  two
  hundred  ten and it conforms to the applicable standards for the type of
  project adopted pursuant to this chapter, and (2)  funds  are  available
  within  the appropriate program category of the capital program that can
  be reserved for each fiscal year required to complete the project.
