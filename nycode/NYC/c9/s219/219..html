<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  219.  Project  initiation;  commitment  plan. a. The inclusion of a
  capital project in the  capital  budget  as  adopted  or  amended  shall
  constitute  a  direction  and  order  to  the agency to proceed with the
  preparation of a scope  of  project  pursuant  to  this  chapter  unless
  sufficient planning funds for such purpose have not been appropriated in
  the  capital budget. The head of the agency shall notify the comptroller
  of the amount of appropriated planning funds to be encumbered  for  such
  purpose.
    b.  The  approval of a scope of project for a capital project pursuant
  to this chapter,  including  the  amount  of  obligations  necessary  to
  finance  the  design and construction of the project, shall constitute a
  direction and  order  to  the  agency  to  design  the  project,  unless
  sufficient  funds  for  such  purpose  have not been appropriated in the
  capital budget or are otherwise not  available  within  the  appropriate
  program  category of the capital program. Such approval shall constitute
  notification to the comptroller of the  comptroller's  authorization  to
  expend appropriated design funds.
    c.  The approval of the final design for a capital project pursuant to
  this chapter shall constitute  a  direction  and  order  to  the  agency
  responsible  for  construction to prepare bid and award documents and to
  proceed to bid, unless sufficient funds for such purpose have  not  been
  appropriated in the capital budget or are otherwise not available within
  each  year  of  the  capital program in which it is projected that funds
  will be expended for the completion of the project. Such approval  shall
  constitute   notification   to  the  comptroller  of  the  comptroller's
  authorization to expend appropriated construction funds.
    d. The mayor shall require each agency to prepare and submit  periodic
  reports  in  regard  to  the progress of its capital projects, including
  schedules and clear explanations of any delays for  particular  projects
  and  summary  information  on each agency's record on such matters. Such
  reports shall be published at least three times each year: within ninety
  days of the adoption of the capital budget; with the preliminary capital
  budget; and with the executive capital budget. Copies  of  such  reports
  shall  be  transmitted  by  the  mayor to the council, the city planning
  commission, and the community boards, the  borough  boards  and  borough
  presidents.  Such reports shall include, for each project, the dates set
  in the adopted capital budget for the completion of scope,  design,  and
  construction and any changes in such dates.
    1. The report issued with the executive budget shall include, for each
  new   capital   project  being  proposed  in  the  executive  budget,  a
  description of the project including, to  the  extent  practicable,  the
  information  required  to be included in a scope of project by paragraph
  four of section two hundred ten.
    2. The report issued  following  the  adoption  of  the  budget  shall
  include,  for each capital project added to the budget, a description of
  the project  including,  to  the  extent  practicable,  the  information
  required  to  be  included  in  a  scope of project by paragraph four of
  section two hundred ten.
    3. The report issued  following  the  adoption  of  the  budget  shall
  include,  for  each  capital  project for which a substantial change was
  made, a revised description of the  project  including,  to  the  extent
  practicable,  the  information  required  to  be  included in a scope of
  project by paragraph four of section two hundred ten.
    e.  Any  capital  project  which  results  in   the   acquisition   or
  construction   of   a  capital  asset  which  will  be  subject  to  the
  requirements of section eleven hundred ten-a shall contain  a  provision
  requiring  a  comprehensive  manual setting forth the useful life of the

  asset and explaining the activities  necessary  to  maintain  the  asset
  throughout such useful life.
    f.  The  mayor may issue directives and adopt rules and regulations in
  regard to  the  execution  of  capital  projects,  consistent  with  the
  requirements  of subdivisions a, b, c and d of this section, which shall
  be binding upon all agencies.
