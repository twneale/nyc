  from the mayor or a borough president, in manner specified  herein,  the

  manner as the  adoption  of  the  capital  budget  and  capital  program
  including the right to approve the proposed amendment as submitted or to
  increase  or  decrease  the amounts of funds proposed to be appropriated
  thereby, but only if funds are available within the capital  budget  and
  the  applicable  program  category  of  the  capital  program; provided,
  however, that (i)  the  mayor  may  only  recommend  such  an  amendment
  relating  to an appropriation included in the capital budget pursuant to
  section two hundred eleven with the concurrence of the relevant  borough
  president;  and  (ii)  the  borough  president  may  only  make  such  a
  recommendation with regard to such an appropriation if it  provides  for
  an offsetting reduction in another appropriation included in the capital
  budget  pursuant  to section two hundred eleven on the recommendation of
  such borough president and it is concurred in by the mayor.
    b.  Upon the adoption of any such amendment by the  council, it  shall
  be  certified  by the mayor, the public advocate and the city clerk, and
  the capital budget shall be amended accordingly.
    c.  Not later than five days after such certification  such  amendment
  shall  be  filed in the office of the comptroller and shall be published
