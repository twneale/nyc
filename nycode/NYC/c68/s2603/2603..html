Section 2603.

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  2603.  Powers and obligations. a. Rules. The board shall promulgate
  rules as are necessary to implement and interpret the provisions of this
  chapter, consistent with the goal of providing clear guidance  regarding
  prohibited  conduct.  The  board,  by  rule, shall once every four years
  adjust the dollar amount established in subdivision sixteen  of  section
  twenty-six  hundred  one  of  this  chapter  to  reflect  changes in the
  consumer price index for the metropolitan  New  York-New  Jersey  region
  published by the United States bureau of labor statistics.
    b.  Training and education. 1. The board shall have the responsibility
  of informing public servants and assisting their  understanding  of  the
  conflicts  of  interest  provisions  of this chapter. In fulfilling this
  responsibility, the board shall develop educational materials  regarding
  the  conflicts of interest provisions and related interpretive rules and
  shall develop and administer an on-going program for  the  education  of
  public servants regarding the provisions of this chapter.
    2.  (a)  The  board  shall  make  information  concerning this chapter
  available and known to all public servants. On or before the  tenth  day
  after  an individual becomes a public servant, such public servant shall
  be provided with a copy  of  this  chapter  and  shall  sign  a  written
  statement,  which shall be maintained in his or her personnel file, that
  such public servant has received and read and  shall  conform  with  the
  provisions of this chapter.
    (b)  Each  public servant shall undergo training provided by the board
  in the provisions of this chapter on or before the sixtieth day after he
  or she becomes a public servant, and periodically as appropriate  during
  the  course  of  his  or  her city service. Every two years, each agency
  shall develop and implement  an  appropriate  agency  training  plan  in
  consultation  with  the board and the mayor's office of operations. Each
  agency shall cooperate with the board in order to ensure that all public
  servants in the agency receive the training required by this subdivision
  and shall maintain records  documenting  such  training  and  the  dates
  thereof.  The  training  required  by this subdivision may be in person,
  provided either by the board itself or by agency  personnel  working  in
  conjunction  with  the board, or through an automated or online training
  program developed by the board.
    (c) The failure of a public servant to receive the  training  required
  by  this  paragraph,  to  receive a copy of this chapter, or to sign the
  statement required by this paragraph, or the failure of  the  agency  to
  maintain the required statement on file or record of training completed,
  shall  have  no effect on the duty of such public servant to comply with
  this chapter or on the enforcement of the provisions thereof.
    c. Advisory opinions. 1. The board shall render advisory opinions with
  respect to all matters covered by  this  chapter.  An  advisory  opinion
  shall  be  rendered  on the request of a public servant or a supervisory
  official of a public  servant  and  shall  apply  only  to  such  public
  servant.  The request shall be in such form as the board may require and
  shall be signed by the person making the request.  The  opinion  of  the
  board  shall  be  based on such facts as are presented in the request or
  subsequently submitted in a written, signed document.
    2. Advisory opinions shall be issued only  with  respect  to  proposed
  future  conduct  or  action  by a public servant. A public servant whose
  conduct or action is the subject of an advisory  opinion  shall  not  be
  subject  to penalties or sanctions by virtue of acting or failing to act
  due to a reasonable reliance on the opinion, unless material facts  were
  omitted  or misstated in the request for an opinion. The board may amend
  a previously issued advisory opinion after giving reasonable  notice  to
  the  public  servant that it is reconsidering its opinion; provided that

  such amended advisory opinion shall apply  only  to  future  conduct  or
  action of the public servant.
    3.  The  board  shall  make  public  its  advisory  opinions with such
  deletions as may be necessary to prevent disclosure of the indentity  of
  any public servant or other involved party. The advisory opinions of the
  board  shall  be  indexed by subject matter and cross-indexed by charter
  section and rule number and such index shall be maintained on an  annual
  and cumulative basis.
    4. Not later than the first day of September, nineteen hundred ninety,
  the  board  shall initiate a rulemaking to adopt, as interpretive of the
  provisions of this chapter, any advisory opinions of the board of ethics
  constituted pursuant to chapter sixty-eight of the charter heretofore in
  effect, which the board determines to be consistent  with  and  to  have
  interpretive value in construing the provisions of this chapter.
    5.  For  the  purposes  of this subdivision, public servant includes a
  prospective and  former  public  servant,  and  a  supervisory  official
  includes a supervisory official who shall supervise a prospective public
  servant  and  a  supervisory  official  who  supervised  a former public
  servant.
    d.  Financial  disclosure.  1.  All  financial  disclosure  statements
  required  to be completed and filed by public servants pursuant to state
  or local law shall be filed by such public servants with the board.
    2. The board shall cause each statement filed with it to  be  examined
  to  determine  if  there  has  been  compliance  with the applicable law
  concerning financial disclosure and  to  determine  if  there  has  been
  compliance with or violations of the provisions of this chapter.
    3.  The  board  shall  issue  rules concerning the filing of financial
  disclosure statements for the purpose of ensuring compliance by the city
  and all public servants with  the  applicable  provisions  of  financial
  disclosure law.
    e.   Complaints.  1.  The  board  shall  receive  complaints  alleging
  violations of this chapter.
    2. Whenever a written complaint is received by the board, it shall:
    (a) dismiss the complaint if it determines that no further  action  is
  required by the board; or
    (b)  refer  the  complaint  to  the  commissioner  of investigation if
  further investigation is required for the board to determine what action
  is appropriate; or
    (c) make an initial determination that  there  is  probable  cause  to
  believe  that a public servant has violated a provision of this chapter;
  or
    (d) refer an alleged violation of this chapter  to  the  head  of  the
  agency served by the public servant, if the board deems the violation to
  be  minor  or  if  related  disciplinary charges are pending against the
  public servant.
    3. For the purposes of this subdivision, a public servant  includes  a
  former public servant.
    f.  Investigations.  1.  The  board shall have the power to direct the
  department of investigation to conduct an investigation  of  any  matter
  related   to  the  board's  responsibilities  under  this  chapter.  The
  commissioner  of  investigation  shall,  within   a   reasonable   time,
  investigate  any such matter and submit a confidential written report of
  factual findings to the board.
    2. The commissioner of investigation shall make a confidential  report
  to  the board concerning the results of all investigations which involve
  or may involve violations of the provisions of this chapter, whether  or
  not such investigations were made at the request of the board.

    g.  Referral  of  matters within the board's jurisdiction. 1. A public
  servant or supervisory official of such public servant may  request  the
  board  to  review  and  make a determination regarding a past or ongoing
  action of such public servant. Such request shall be reviewed and  acted
  upon  by  the  board  in  the same manner as a complaint received by the
  board under subdivision e of this section.
    2. Whenever an agency receives a complaint  alleging  a  violation  of
  this  chapter  or  determines  that a violation of this chapter may have
  occurred, it shall refer such matter to the board. Such  referral  shall
  be  reviewed  and  acted  upon  by  the  board  in  the same manner as a
  complaint received by the board under subdivision e of this section.
    3. For the purposes of this subdivision,  public  servant  includes  a
  former public servant, and a supervisory official includes a supervisory
  official who supervised a former public servant.
    h.  Hearings. 1. If the board makes an initial determination, based on
  a complaint, investigation or other information available to the  board,
  that  there  is  probable  cause  to believe that the public servant has
  violated a provision of this chapter, the board shall notify the  public
  servant  of  its  determination  in  writing. The notice shall contain a
  statement of the facts upon which the board relied for its determination
  of probable cause and a statement of the  provisions  of  law  allegedly
  violated.  The board shall also inform the public servant of the board's
  procedural rules. Such public servant shall have a  reasonable  time  to
  respond,  either  orally  or  in writing, and shall have the right to be
  represented by counsel or any other person.
    2. If, after receipt of  the  public  servant's  response,  the  board
  determines  that  there is no probable cause to believe that a violation
  has occurred, the board shall dismiss the matter and inform  the  public
  servant  in  writing of its decision. If, after the consideration of the
  response by the public  servant,  the  board  determines  there  remains
  probable  cause  to  believe  that a violation of the provisions of this
  chapter has occurred, the board shall hold or direct  a  hearing  to  be
  held  on the record to determine whether such violation has occurred, or
  shall refer the matter to the appropriate agency if the  public  servant
  is subject to the jurisdiction of any state law or collective bargaining
  agreement  which  provides  for the conduct of disciplinary proceedings,
  provided that when such a matter is referred to an  agency,  the  agency
  shall consult with the board before issuing a final decision.
    3.  If  the board determines, after a hearing or the opportunity for a
  hearing, that a public servant has violated provisions of this  chapter,
  it  shall,  after  consultation  with  the  head of the agency served or
  formerly served by the public servant, or in the case of an agency head,
  with the mayor, issue an order either imposing such  penalties  provided
  for  by  this  chapter  as  it  deems  appropriate, or recommending such
  penalties to the head of the agency served or  formerly  served  by  the
  public  servant,  or  in  the  case  of  an  agency  head, to the mayor;
  provided, however, that the board shall  not  impose  penalties  against
  members of the council, or public servants employed by the council or by
  members  of the council, but may recommend to the council such penalties
  as it deems appropriate. The order shall include findings  of  fact  and
  conclusions  of  law.  When  a  penalty  is recommended, the head of the
  agency or the council shall report to the board what action was taken.
    4. Hearings of the board shall not be public unless requested  by  the
  public servant. The order and the board's findings and conclusions shall
  be made public.
    5.  The  board  shall  maintain an index of all persons found to be in
  violation of this chapter, by name, office and date of order. The  index

  and  the determinations of probable cause and orders in such cases shall
  be made available for public inspection and copying.
    6.  Nothing  contained  in  this section shall prohibit the appointing
  officer of a public servant from terminating or  otherwise  disciplining
  such   public  servant,  where  such  appointing  officer  is  otherwise
  authorized to  do  so;  provided,  however,  that  such  action  by  the
  appointing  officer  shall  not  preclude  the board from exercising its
  powers and duties under this chapter with respect to the actions of  any
  such public servant.
    7. For the purposes of this subdivision, the term public servant shall
  include a former public servant.
    i. Annual report. The board shall submit an annual report to the mayor
  and  the  council  in  accordance with section eleven hundred and six of
  this charter. The report shall include a summary of the proceedings  and
  activities  of  the  board,  a description of the education and training
  conducted pursuant to the requirements of this  chapter,  a  statistical
  summary  and  evaluation  of complaints and referrals received and their
  disposition, such legislative and administrative recommendations as  the
  board  deems  appropriate,  the  rules  of  the  board, and the index of
  opinions and orders of that  year.  The  report,  which  shall  be  made
  available  to  the  public,  shall  not  contain  information, which, if
  disclosed, would constitute an unwarranted invasion of the privacy of  a
  public servant.
    j. Revision. The board shall review the provisions of this chapter and
  shall  recommend  to  the  council  from  time  to  time such changes or
  additions as it may consider appropriate or desirable. Such  review  and
  recommendation shall be made at least once every five years.
    k. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the records, reports,
  memoranda  and files of the board shall be confidential and shall not be
  subject to public scrutiny.
