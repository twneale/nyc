    &sect;  2602. Conflicts of interest board. a. There shall be a conflicts of
  interest board consisting of five members, appointed by the  mayor  with
  the  advice  and  consent  of  the  council. The mayor shall designate a

  commitment  and  high  ethical standards. No person while a member shall
  hold any public office, seek election to any public office, be a  public
  employee in any jurisdiction, hold any political party office, or appear
  as a lobbyist before the city.
    c. Each member shall serve for a term of six years; provided, however,
  that  of the three members first appointed, one shall be appointed for a
  term to expire on March thirty-first, nineteen hundred ninety, one shall
  be appointed for a  term  to  expire  on  March  thirty-first,  nineteen
  hundred  ninety-two  and  one shall be appointed for a term to expire on
  March thirty-first, nineteen hundred ninety-four, and of  the  remaining
  members,  one  shall  be  appointed  for  a  term  to  expire  on  March
  thirty-first, nineteen hundred ninety-two and one shall be appointed for
  a term to expire on March thirty-first, nineteen hundred ninety-four. If
  the mayor has not submitted to the council a nomination for  appointment
  of  a  successor at least sixty days prior to the expiration of the term
  of the member whose term is expiring, the term of the member  in  office
  shall  be  extended for an additional year and the term of the successor
  to such member shall be shortened by an equal amount  of  time.  If  the
  council  fails  to  act  within  forty-five  days  of  receipt  of  such
  nomination from  the  mayor,  the  nomination  shall  be  deemed  to  be
  confirmed.  No member shall serve for more than two consecutive six-year
  terms. The three initial nominations by the mayor shall be made  by  the
  first  day  of  February,  nineteen  hundred eighty-nine, and both later
  nominations by the mayor shall be  made  by  the  first  day  of  March,
  nineteen hundred ninety.
    d.  Members  shall  receive  a per diem compensation, no less than the
  highest amount paid to an official appointed to a  board  or  commission
  with the advice and consent of the council and compensated on a per diem
  basis, for each calendar day when performing the work of the board.
    e.  Members  of the board shall serve until their successors have been
  confirmed. Any vacancy occurring other than  by  expiration  of  a  term
  shall  be  filled  by nomination by the mayor made to the council within
  sixty days of the creation of the vacancy, for the unexpired portion  of
  the  term  of  the  member succeeded. If the council fails to act within
  forty-five days of receipt  of  such  nomination  from  the  mayor,  the
  nomination shall be deemed to be confirmed.
    f.  Members  may  be  removed  by the mayor for substantial neglect of
  duty, gross misconduct in office, inability to discharge the  powers  or
  duties  of office or violation of this section, after written notice and
  opportunity for a reply.
    g. The board shall appoint a counsel to  serve  at  its  pleasure  and
  shall employ or retain such other officers, employees and consultants as
  are  necessary  to  exercise its powers and fulfill its obligations. The
  authority of the counsel shall be  defined  in  writing,  provided  that
  neither  the  counsel,  nor any other officer, employee or consultant of
  the board shall be authorized to issue advisory    opinions,  promulgate
  rules, issue subpoenas, issue final determinations of violations of this
  chapter, or make final recommendations of or impose penalties. The board
  may delegate its authority to issue advisory opinions to the chair.
    h.  The board shall meet at least once a month and at such other times
  as the chair  may  deem  necessary.  Two  members  of  the  board  shall
  constitute  a  quorum  and  all  acts  of  the  board  shall  be  by the
  affirmative vote of at least two members of the board.
