    &sect;  14.  Office  of  veterans'  affairs. a. There shall be an office of
  veterans' affairs, the head of which shall be the director of  veterans'
  affairs, who shall be appointed by the mayor.
    b. Definition. The term "veteran" means a person who has served in the
  active  military  service of the United States and who has been released
  from such service otherwise than by dishonorable discharge.
    c. Powers and duties.  The  office:  1.  shall  have  such  powers  as
  provided by the director of the state veterans' service agency and shall
  have  the  duty  to  inform military and naval authorities of the United
  States and assist members of the armed  forces  and  veterans,  who  are
  residents  of this state, and their families, in relation to (a) matters
  pertaining  to  educational  training  and   retraining   services   and
  facilities,   (b)   health,   medical  and  rehabilitation  service  and
  facilities,  (c)  provisions  of  federal,  state  and  local  laws  and
  regulations  affording  special  rights and privileges to members of the
  armed forces  and  veterans  and  their  families,  (d)  employment  and
  re-employment  services,  and  (e)  other matters of similar, related or
  appropriate nature. The office also shall perform such other  duties  as
  may  be  assigned  by  the  state  director of the division of veterans'
  affairs;
    2. shall utilize, so  far  as  possible,  the  services,  commissions,
  boards, bureaus, institutions and other agencies of the state and of the
  political  subdivisions thereof and all such officers and agencies shall
  cooperate with and extend such services and facilities to the office  as
  it may require.
    d.  Veterans advisory board. There shall be a veterans' advisory board
  consisting of nine members, all of whom shall be veterans, five of  whom
  shall  be  appointed by the mayor and four of whom shall be appointed by
  the speaker of the council of the  city  of  New  York.  Of  these  nine
  appointees,  there  shall  be  one  representative from each of the five
  boroughs of the city of New York. The mayor and the speaker  shall  each
  consider  service  in  conflicts  involving members of the United States
  armed forces when making such appointments. All members shall serve  for
  a  term of three (3) years and may be removed by the appointing official
  for cause. Members of the advisory board shall elect  by  majority  vote
  one  such member to serve as chairperson and one such member to serve as
  vice-chairperson, each to serve in that capacity for one-year terms.  In
  the  event  of a vacancy on the advisory board during the term of office
  of a member by reason of removal, death, resignation,  or  otherwise,  a
  successor   shall   be  chosen  in  the  same  manner  as  the  original
  appointment. A member appointed to fill a vacancy shall  serve  for  the
  balance  of  the unexpired term. The advisory board shall (i) advise the
  director  on  all  matters  concerning  veterans;  (ii)  meet  at  least
  quarterly;  (iii) keep a record of its deliberations; (iv) determine its
  own rules  of  procedure;  and  (v)  submit  an  annual  report  of  its
  activities  to  the  mayor and the council on or before December 31st of
  each year.
