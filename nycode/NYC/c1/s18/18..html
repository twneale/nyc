Section 18.

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 18. Office of immigrant affairs. a. The city recognizes that a large
  percentage  of  its  inhabitants were born abroad or are the children of
  parents who were born abroad and that the well-being and safety  of  the
  city  is  put  in jeopardy if the people of the city do not seek medical
  treatment for illnesses that may be contagious, do  not  cooperate  with
  the  police when they witness a crime or do not avail themselves of city
  services to educate themselves  and  their  children.  It  is  therefore
  desirable  that the city promote the utilization of city services by all
  its residents, including foreign-born inhabitants, speakers  of  foreign
  languages and undocumented aliens.
    b.  In  furtherance  of  the  policies stated in subdivision a of this
  section, there shall be established in the executive office of the mayor
  an office of  immigrant  affairs.  The  office  shall  be  headed  by  a
  director,  who  shall  be  appointed  by  the mayor. The director of the
  office of immigrant affairs shall have the power and the duty to:
    1. advise and assist the mayor  and  the  council  in  developing  and
  implementing   policies   designed   to   assist  immigrants  and  other
  foreign-language speakers in the city;
    2. enhance the  accessibility  of  city  services  to  immigrants  and
  foreign-language speakers by establishing programs to inform and educate
  immigrant and foreign language speakers of such services;
    3.   manage  a  citywide  list  of  translators  and  interpreters  to
  facilitate communication between  city  agencies  and  foreign  language
  speakers;
    4.   perform  policy  analysis  and  make  recommendations  concerning
  immigrant affairs; and
    5. perform such other duties and functions as may  be  appropriate  to
  pursue the policies set forth in subdivision a of this section.
    c.  Any  service  provided by a city agency shall be made available to
  all aliens who are otherwise eligible  for  such  service  to  the  same
  extent  such service is made available to citizens unless such agency is
  required by law to deny eligibility for such service to aliens.
