    &sect;  13-a.  Code  of  administrative judicial conduct. The mayor and the
  chief administrative law judge of the office  of  administrative  trials
  and hearings shall jointly promulgate, and may from time to time jointly
  amend,  rules  establishing  a  code  or  codes  of professional conduct
  governing the activities of all administrative law  judges  and  hearing
  officers  in city tribunals, except to the extent that such promulgation
  would be inconsistent with law. Prior to promulgating  or  amending  any
  such  rules,  the  mayor  and  the  chief administrative law judge shall
  consult with the  conflicts  of  interest  board,  the  commissioner  of
  investigation  and affected agency and administrative tribunal heads. An
  administrative law judge or hearing officer shall be subject to  removal
  or other disciplinary action for violating such rules in the manner that
  such  administrative  law  judge  or  hearing  officer may be removed or
  otherwise disciplined under law.  Further,  such  rules  may  set  forth
  additional  sanctions  or  penalties for violations of such rules to the
  extent consistent with law.
