<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  225.    Budgetary  responsibilities  of  the mayor, the director of
  management and budget and the comptroller.   a.   The mayor  shall  each
  year,  in  accordance  with  the provisions of this chapter, prepare and
  submit to the council a preliminary budget and an executive budget  each
  of  which  shall  present a complete financial plan for the city and its
  agencies for the ensuing fiscal year, setting forth  proposed  operating
  and  capital  expenditures,  proposed  interfund  transfers, anticipated
  revenues and any other anticipated sources and uses of funds. Each  such
  budget  shall  consist of three parts:  the expense budget,  which shall
  set forth proposed appropriations for the operating expenses of the city
  including debt service;  the capital budget and program, which shall set
  forth proposed appropriations  for  capital  projects  for  the  ensuing
  fiscal  year  and  the  three succeeding fiscal years; and   the revenue
  budget,  which shall set forth the estimated revenues  and  receipts  of
  the city.
    b.  There shall be an office of management and budget in the executive
  office of the mayor, the head of which shall be director  of  management
  and budget who shall be appointed by the mayor.  It shall be the duty of
  the  director  to  perform  all  such duties in regard to the budget and
  related matters as the mayor may direct.  The director of management and
  budget shall have the power, personally or through  representatives,  to
  survey  each  agency  for  the  purpose  of  ascertaining  its budgetary
  requirements.  The director may require any agency, or  any  officer  or
  employee,  to  furnish  data  and  information  and  to answer inquiries
  pertinent to the exercise of any of the director's duties in  regard  to
  the budget and related matters.
    c.    The comptroller shall produce timely analyses of the preliminary
  and executive  budgets including evaluations of the  recommendations  of
  the  borough  presidents,  as  well  as  those  of the mayor, and of the
  assumptions and methodologies used by the mayor in  making  the  revenue
  estimates contained in such budgets.
