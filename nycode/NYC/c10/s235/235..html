    &sect;  235.  Preliminary  certificate  of  the  mayor  on capital debt and
  obligations.  No later than the sixteenth  day  of  January,  the  mayor
  shall  submit  to  the council, the comptroller,  the borough presidents
  and the city planning commission and publish a  preliminary  certificate
  setting  forth  the  maximum  amount  of debt and reserves which, in the
  mayor's opinion, the city may soundly incur for capital projects  during
  the  ensuing  fiscal  year and during each of the following three fiscal
  years, and the maximum amount of  appropriations  and  expenditures  for
  capital  projects  which the city, given such maximum amount of debt and
  reserves, may soundly make during each such fiscal year.  At any time up
  to the submission of the executive capital budget to  the  council,  the
  mayor  may amend such preliminary certificate. Any such amendments shall
  be submitted to the council, the comptroller, the borough presidents and
  the city planning  commission,  and  published  forthwith  in  the  City
  Record.
