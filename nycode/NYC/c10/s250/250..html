  the capital plant, as such terms are defined in subdivision a of section
  eleven  hundred  ten-a,  categorized  by  agency  and  project  type; an
  explanation of the differences, if any, between such proposed activities
  and the activities scheduled to be undertaken during  such  fiscal  year
