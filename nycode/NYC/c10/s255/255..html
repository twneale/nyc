Section 255.

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  255. Veto of the mayor.  a. The mayor, not later than the fifth day
  after the council  has  acted  upon    the  budget  or  capital  program
  submitted  with  the  executive  budget,  may disapprove any increase or
  addition to the budget, any unit of appropriation, or any change in  any
  term  or  condition  of  the budget.   The mayor, by such date, may also
  disapprove any item or term  or  condition  included  in  such    budget
  pursuant  to  the  provisions of section two hundred forty-three of this
  chapter.   The mayor shall return the  budget    by  that  date  to  the
  council, setting forth objections in writing.
    b.   The council, by a two-thirds vote of all the council members, may
  override any disapproval by the mayor pursuant to subdivision a of  this
  section;  provided,  however,  that  if no such action by the council is
  taken within ten days of such disapproval, the expense budget  to  which
  such  disapprovals  relate  shall  be  deemed adopted as modified by the
  disapprovals by the mayor.
