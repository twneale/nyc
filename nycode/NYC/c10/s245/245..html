Section 245.

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 245.  Borough president recommendations to the mayor.  a.  Not later
  than the  tenth day of March, each borough president shall submit to the
  mayor  and  council, in such form and containing such information as the
  mayor shall prescribe, any proposed  modifications  of  the  preliminary
  budget  which  the  borough  president recommends in accordance with the
  provisions of subdivision b of this section.
    b.  Each borough president shall propose  such  modifications  to  the
  preliminary  budget  as  the  borough  president deems to be in the best
  interest of the borough, taking into consideration community and borough
  board priorities and testimony received at public hearings held pursuant
  to section  two  hundred  forty-one.    The  net  effects  of  any  such
  modifications  recommended by the borough president may not result in an
  increase in  the  total  amount  of    appropriations  proposed  in  the
  preliminary budget.  If increases in  appropriations  within the borough
  are  recommended,  offsetting  reductions in other appropriations within
  the  borough  must  also  be  recommended.  Each  proposed  increase  or
  reduction  must  be stated separately and distinctly and refer each to a
  single object or purpose.
