    &sect;  254.    Amendment  and  adoption  of the executive budget. a.   The
  council may not alter the budget as  submitted by the mayor pursuant  to
  section two hundred forty-nine except to increase, decrease, add or omit
  any  unit  of  appropriation for personal service or other than personal
  service or any appropriation for any capital project  or  add,  omit  or
  change   any   terms   or   conditions   related  to  any  or  all  such
  appropriations; provided, however, that each increase or  addition  must
  be  stated  separately  and distinctly from any items of the  budget and
  refer each to a single object or purpose; and, provided,  further,  that
  the  aggregate amount appropriated for capital projects shall not exceed
  the  maximum  amount  of  appropriations  contained   in   the   mayor's
  certificate  issued  pursuant  to  subdivision  sixteen  of  section two
  hundred fifty.
    b. The council shall consider, and act upon, all recommendations  made
  by  the  borough presidents pursuant to section two hundred fifty-one of
  this chapter and all recommendations  made  by  the  mayor  pursuant  to
  paragraph thirteen of section two hundred fifty of this chapter.
    c.  The  budget  when  adopted  by  the council shall become effective
  immediately  without  further  action  by   the   mayor,   except   that
  appropriations  for  the  council or appropriations added to the mayor's
  executive budget by the council or any changes in terms and  conditions,
  shall be subject to the veto of the mayor.
    d.  If an expense budget has not been adopted by the fifth day of June
  pursuant to subdivisions a and b of this section, the expense budget and
  tax rate adopted as modified for the current fiscal year shall be deemed
  to  have  been extended for the new fiscal year until such time as a new
  expense budget has been adopted.
    e. If a capital budget  and a capital program have not been adopted by
  the fifth day of June pursuant to  subdivisions a and b of this section,
  the unutilized portion of all  prior  capital  appropriations  shall  be
  deemed reappropriated.
