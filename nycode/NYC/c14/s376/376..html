Section 376.

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  376.  Central file.   Copies of all franchise and revocable consent
  agreements shall be filed with the department of  transportation.    The
  department of transportation shall compile and keep up to date a listing
  of  all  current  franchises  and  revocable  consents  which  shall  be
  available to the public and shall include the date, terms, names of  the
  parties, description of the permitted use and location of each franchise
  and revocable consent.  Such listing shall be arranged and indexed so as
  to  enable  a  member of the public to determine what current franchises
  and revocable  consents  involving  use  or  occupancy  of  streets  and
  sidewalks  have  been  granted  for  any  location  in  the city and the
  identity of the holder of each such franchise or revocable consent.
