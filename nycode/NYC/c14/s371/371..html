    &sect;  371.  Public  hearing on proposed agreement; publication of notice.
  The  franchise  and  concession  review  committee  in  the  case  of  a
  franchise, or the responsible agency in the case of a revocable consent,
  shall  hold a public hearing on the proposed agreement memorializing the
  terms and conditions of each proposed  franchise  or  revocable  consent
  before  final  approval  of  the proposed franchise or consent. Any such
  public  hearing  conducted  by  the  franchise  and  concession   review
  committee  shall  be  held  within  thirty  days  of the filing with the
  committee by the responsible agency of a proposed  agreement  containing
  the  terms and conditions of the proposed franchise.  No hearing held by
  the franchise and concession review  committee  or  by  the  responsible
  agency  shall  be  held  until after notice thereof and a summary of the
  terms and conditions of the proposed agreement shall have been published
  for  at  least  fifteen  days,  except  Sundays  and   legal   holidays,
  immediately prior thereto in the City Record, nor until a notice of such
  hearing, indicating the place where copies of the proposed agreement may
  be  obtained  by all those interested therein, shall have been published
  at least twice at the  expense  of  the  proposed  grantee  in  a  daily
  newspaper  designated by the mayor which is published in the city of New
  York and having a circulation in the borough or boroughs  in  which  the
  affected  property  of  the  city  is  located and a weekly newspaper or
  newspapers designated by the mayor which are published in  the  city  of
  New  York  and have a circulation in the community district or districts
  in which the affected property of the city is located.  In the  event  a
  franchise  or  revocable consent relates to property of the city located
  in more than one borough, notice of hearing in a weekly newspaper  shall
  not  be required; however, in that event, notice of hearing in two daily
  newspapers, and mailing by the  grantee,  no  later  than  fifteen  days
  immediately  prior  to the date of the public hearing, of such notice to
  the borough presidents and community boards and council members in whose
  districts the affected  property  of  the  city  is  located,  shall  be
  required.  In  the case of a franchise for a bus route which crosses one
  or more borough boundaries, notice of  hearing  in  a  weekly  newspaper
  shall  not be required; however, in that event, notice of hearing in two
  daily newspapers, and mailing by the grantee, no later than fifteen days
  immediately prior to the date of the public hearing, of such  notice  to
  the borough presidents and community boards and council members in whose
  districts  the  bus  route is located, and posting of such notice in the
  buses operating upon such route, shall be required.
