    &sect;   324.   Prequalification.   a.   Agencies  may  maintain  lists  of
  prequalified vendors and  entry  into  a  prequalified  group  shall  be
  continuously  available.  Prospective  vendors  may  be  prequalified as
  contractors for the provision of particular types of goods, services and
  construction, in accordance with general criteria established by rule of
  the procurement policy board which may include, but shall not be limited
  to,  the  experience,  past  performance,  ability  to  undertake  work,
  financial  capability,  responsibility,  and  reliability of prospective
  bidders, and which may be supplemented by criteria established  by  rule
  of  the  agency for the prequalification of vendors for particular types
  of goods, services or construction or by criteria published in the  City
  Record  by  the  agency  prior  to the prequalification of vendors for a
  particular procurement.  Such  prequalification  may  be  by  categories
  designated by size and other factors.
    b. Any vendor who is denied prequalification or whose prequalification
  is  revoked  by an agency may appeal such decision to the agency head. A
  determination of an agency  head  may  be  appealed  to  the  office  of
  administrative  trials  and hearings for a hearing and such office shall
  take final action regarding such matter. A  decision  by  an  agency  to
  suspend  a vendor's prequalification may be appealed to the agency head,
  provided that if such suspension extends for more than three  months  it
  shall be deemed a revocation of the prequalification for the purposes of
  this section.
