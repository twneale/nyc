Section 317.

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;   317.  Alternatives  to  competitive  sealed  bidding.  a.  If,  in
  accordance with section three hundred twelve, an agency determines  that
  the  use  of  competitive  sealed  bidding  is  not  practicable  or not
  advantageous to the city, the agency shall select the  most  competitive
  alternative method of procurement provided for by sections three hundred
  eighteen through three hundred twenty-two which is appropriate under the
  circumstance.   Each agency contract file shall contain documentation of
  such determination and of the basis upon which each contract is awarded,
  as is required by the procurement policy board.
    b. Each contract for goods, services or construction in value of  more
  than  five  million dollars proposed by an agency to be awarded which is
  let by other than  (i)  competitive  sealed  bidding,  (ii)  competitive
  sealed  bids  from  prequalified  vendors,  or  (iii) competitive sealed
  proposals, where the weight assigned to each of the factors or  criteria
  to be considered in selecting the proposal most advantageous to the city
  was  set  forth  in a writing filed in the agency contract file prior to
  the opening of proposals, shall require the approval of the mayor  prior
  to its execution. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the mayor may,
  where  the  mayor  has  determined  that  it  is appropriate, exclude an
  agency's contracts or  a  particular  category  of  contracts  from  the
  approval requirement of this subdivision.
