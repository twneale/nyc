  made,  except as otherwise provided by law or by rule of the procurement
  policy board.
    b. All other goods shall be purchased or procured by the department of
  citywide administrative services, except as otherwise provided  pursuant
  to this chapter or other law.
    c.  Pursuant  to  rules of the procurement policy board and subject to
  other sections of this chapter, each agency may purchase directly  goods
  in an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars for each transaction or,
  with  the  prior approval of the commissioner of citywide administrative
  services, in an amount not to exceed  five  thousand  dollars  for  each
  transaction.  The  limitation  of  this  subdivision  shall not apply to
  purchases by an agency under a  vendor  contract  entered  into  by  the
  commissioner of citywide administrative services.
    d.  The  dollar  limits  for direct agency purchases without the prior
  approval  of  the  commissioner  of  citywide  administrative   services
  pursuant to subdivision c of this section may be raised to five thousand
  dollars for each transaction for any or all agencies by the commissioner
  of  citywide administrative services with the approval of the mayor. Any
  proposed increases in the limits for such purchases above five  thousand
  dollars shall be subject to the further approval of the comptroller. Any
  increase  in  dollar  limits  pursuant  to  this  subdivision  shall  be
  published in the City Record and may be rescinded by the commissioner of
  citywide administrative services, the mayor, or the comptroller.
    e. Subject to the approval of the comptroller, a specific  procurement
  of  a  specific  good  may  be delegated by the commissioner of citywide
  administrative services, in the best interest of the city, to any agency
  for direct purchase by such agency, and shall  not  be  subject  to  the
  provisions of subdivisions b, c or d of this section; provided, however,
  that  such  delegation  shall  not  be  made  for  goods  that are to be
  generally used by city agencies.
