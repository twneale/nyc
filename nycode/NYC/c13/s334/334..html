  shall  promptly  provide  such  documentation  as  is requested or shall
  promptly respond  to  the  requesting  official  with  reason  why  such
  documentation  cannot  be provided.  If the mayor or agency is unable to
  provide the requested documentation within ten business days of the  day
  the  request  is  received,  the  mayor or agency shall within such time
  deliver to the requesting  official  a  statement  of  the  reasons  the
  documentation  can  not  be  promptly provided and shall include in such
  statement a timetable within which the documentation will  be  provided,
  not to exceed thirty days from the date of the original request.
