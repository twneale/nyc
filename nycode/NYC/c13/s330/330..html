    &sect;  330.  Inspection.  Inspection  and  acceptance  or rejection of all
  deliveries of goods shall be made by the agency that  makes  the  direct
  purchase  other  than  under  a  vendor  contract.  The  commissioner of
  citywide administrative  services  may  authorize  an  agency  to  which
  delivery  is  made  to  perform  such functions on purchases made by the
  department of citywide administrative services subject to standards  and
  policies  of  the  commissioner. The comptroller may continue to perform
  such  inspectional  duties  as  are  necessary  for  auditing  purposes,
  including  ascertainment  of whether items purchased and paid for by the
  department of citywide administrative services or  other  agencies  have
  been received and put to use by agencies.
