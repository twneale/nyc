    &sect;  312. Procurement; general rule and exceptions. a. Prior to entering
  into, renewing, or extending a contract valued at more than two  hundred
  thousand dollars to provide standard or professional services, including
  agency  task  orders  pursuant to multi-agency task order contracts, but
  excluding emergency  procurements,  government-to-government  purchases,
  and  the procurement of legal services or consulting services in support
  of current or  anticipated  litigation,  investigative  or  confidential
  services,  an  agency  shall follow the procedure established herein and
  the mayor shall comply with the  reporting  requirements  set  forth  in
  paragraph 8.
    1.  Prior to issuing an invitation for bids, request for proposals, or
  other solicitation, or renewing or extending an existing  contract,  the
  agency  shall  determine whether such contract is the result of or would
  result in the displacement of any city employee within the  agency.  For
  the  purpose  of  this section, "displacement" shall mean a reduction in
  the number of funded positions,  including  but  not  limited  to,  that
  resulting  from  the  attrition;  layoff; demotion; bumping; involuntary
  transfer to a new class, title, or location; time-based  reductions,  or
  reductions  in  customary  hours of work, wages, or benefits of any city
  employee.
    a. There shall be a presumptive determination that a proposed contract
  is the result of or would result in displacement if any of the following
  events occurred in the three year period preceding the date  the  agency
  intends  to issue an invitation for bids, request for proposal, or other
  solicitation, or renew or extend an existing contract:
    (1) the displacement of a city employee within the agency who performs
  or has performed the services sought by  the  proposed  contract  and/or
  services of a substantially similar nature or purpose; or
    (2)  the  announcement  of  spending  reductions  in connection with a
  budgetary program, including but not limited to a Program  to  Eliminate
  the Gap, that could result or has resulted in the displacement of a city
  employee  within  the  agency who performs or has performed the services
  sought by the proposed  contract  and/or  services  of  a  substantially
  similar nature or purpose; or
    (3)  any  other  statement  by  an  agency  or the mayor of a specific
  anticipated employment action that could result or has resulted  in  the
  displacement  of  a  city employee within the agency who performs or has
  performed the services sought by the proposed contract  and/or  services
  of a substantially similar nature or purpose.
    b.  If  the  agency  determines  that displacement would not occur, it
  shall include a certification to that effect, signed by the agency head,
  in  any  invitation  for  bids,  request   for   proposals,   or   other
  solicitation,   or   with   any  contract  renewal  or  extension.  Such
  certification shall detail the basis upon which  the  agency  determined
  that  displacement would not occur, construing broadly the nature of the
  services sought and providing information including but not limited  to:
  (i)  whether  any civil service title and/or job title within the agency
  currently  performs  the  services  solicited  and/or  services   of   a
  substantially  similar  nature or purpose, the names of such titles, and
  the extent to  which  agency  employees  within  such  titles  currently
  perform  such  services;  (ii)  whether  the  solicited services expand,
  supplement, or replace existing services,  and  a  detailed  description
  comparing  the  solicited  services  with  such existing services; (iii)
  whether there is capacity within the  agency  to  perform  the  services
  solicited  and,  if  there  is  no such capacity, a detailed description
  specifying the ways in which the agency lacks such  capacity;  (iv)  for
  the  term of the proposed contract, the projected headcount of employees
  within such  titles  or  employees  who  perform  such  services  and/or

  services   of  a  substantially  similar  nature  or  purpose;  and  (v)
  confirmation that none of the events set forth in subparagraph a of this
  paragraph occurred within the agency in the three year period  preceding
  the  date  such  agency intends to issue an invitation for bids, request
  for proposal, or other solicitation, or  renew  or  extend  an  existing
  contract.
    c.  If the agency determines that displacement would occur, the agency
  shall  determine  the  costs  incurred  and  the  benefits  derived   in
  performing  the  service,  consistent  with the scope and specifications
  within the solicitation, renewal, or extension, with city employees, and
  shall submit such analysis, with all supporting documentation, prior  to
  issuance  of  any  solicitation  or  entry  into any contract renewal or
  extension, to the comptroller.
    2. Immediately upon receipt of bids, proposals, and other solicitation
  responses, or prior to the renewal or extension of an existing contract,
  the agency shall submit such  determination,  analysis,  and  supporting
  documentation   to   the  council  and  to  the  appropriate  collective
  bargaining representatives representing employees who would be  affected
  pursuant to paragraph 1 of subdivision a of this section.
    3.  Prior  to  award  of  a  contract, a renewal, or an extension, the
  agency shall perform a comparative analysis of the costs expected to  be
  incurred  and  the  benefits  expected to be derived from entering into,
  renewing, or extending a contract with the  proposed  vendor,  based  on
  such  vendor's  best  and final offer, and such agency's analysis of the
  costs incurred and the benefits derived from providing the service  with
  city  employees.  If  the agency head intends to award, renew, or extend
  the contract, he or she shall submit the reasons therefor, together with
  such analysis, and all supporting documentation, to the comptroller, the
  council,  and  the  appropriate  collective  bargaining  representatives
  representing  employees who would be affected pursuant to paragraph 1 of
  subdivision a of this section.
    4. The council may, within thirty days after receipt of such  reasons,
  analysis, and supporting documentation hold a hearing on this matter. No
  contract  award,  renewal,  or  extension  shall  be  made  prior to the
  expiration of this thirty-day period or a council hearing, whichever  is
  sooner.
    5.  a.  All  cost and comparative analyses required under this section
  shall be conducted in accordance with standard methodology of the office
  of  management  and  budget,  and  consistent  with  the  rules  of  the
  procurement  policy  board,  as  both  are  modified  herein, subject to
  further modification by local  law.  Such  analyses  shall  include  all
  reasonable  costs  associated  with  performing  the  service using city
  employees and  all  reasonable  costs  associated  with  performing  the
  service under the proposed contract or contract renewal or extension.
    b.   Such   analyses   shall   further   include   the  total  number,
  qualifications, job descriptions, and titles  of  all  personnel  to  be
  employed  by  the vendor under the proposed contract or contract renewal
  or extension, as well as the nature and cost of salaries and benefits to
  be provided to such personnel.
    c. Such analyses shall further include, but not  be  limited  to,  the
  cost  of  employee  supervision directly related to the provision of the
  service,   vendor   solicitation,   contract    preparation,    contract
  administration, monitoring and evaluating the contractor, capitalization
  of  equipment  over the period such equipment shall be in use, supplies,
  the cost of providing the equivalent quantity and quality of service  by
  city  employees  compared  to  the  cost  of  providing  such service by
  contract, based upon the best and final offer of  the  proposed  vendor,

  and  such  other factors as will assist in arriving at full and accurate
  cost determinations and comparisons.
    6.  The  reasons  given to award, renew, or extend the contracts shall
  include all factors that have been  considered  in  determining  whether
  contracting  for  this  service  is  in  the  best interest of the city,
  whether or not such reasons are contained within the cost or comparative
  analyses. Such factors  shall  include,  but  not  be  limited  to,  the
  potential  for  contractor  default,  the  time  required to perform the
  service, and the quality of the service to be delivered.
    7. The mayor or his or her designee may prepare and implement  a  plan
  of  assistance for displaced city employees, which may include, but need
  not be limited to,  training  to  place  such  employees  in  comparable
  positions within the contracting agency or any other agency. The cost of
  such  assistance plan may be included within the cost of contracting-out
  in the cost and comparative analyses.
    8. a. For the purposes of  this  paragraph,  "agency"  means  a  city,
  county,  borough  or other office, position, administration, department,
  division, bureau, board, commission,  authority,  corporation,  advisory
  committee  or other agency of government, the expenses of which are paid
  in whole or in part from the city treasury, and shall include but not be
  limited to, the  department  of  education,  the  health  and  hospitals
  corporation,  and  the  New  York  city housing authority, but shall not
  include any court, or any local development corporation or other not for
  profit corporation or  institution,  including  such  a  corporation  or
  institution maintaining or operating a public library, museum, botanical
  garden,  arboretum, tomb, memorial building, aquarium, zoological garden
  or similar facility.
    b. The mayor shall, no later than July 31st of each year, produce  and
  publish  on  the  mayor's office of contract services website a plan and
  schedule for each agency detailing the anticipated  contracting  actions
  of  each such agency for the upcoming fiscal year. The plan and schedule
  shall include: (i) information specific to each  prospective  invitation
  for  bids,  request  for proposal, or other solicitation, including, but
  not limited to, the nature of services sought, the term of the  proposed
  contract,  the method of the solicitation the agency intends to utilize,
  the anticipated fiscal year quarter of  the  planned  solicitation,  the
  civil  service  and/or  job  titles  within  the  agency who perform the
  services sought and/or services of a  substantially  similar  nature  or
  purpose,  if  any, and the headcount of employees within such titles who
  perform such services; and (ii) information specific  to  each  proposed
  contract  renewal  or  extension,  including,  but  not  limited to, any
  modifications sought to the nature of the services performed  under  the
  contract,  the  term  of  the proposed renewed or extended contract, the
  reason(s) the agency intends to renew or extend such contract, the month
  and year of the expiration of the existing contract, the  civil  service
  and/or  job  titles  within  the  agency who perform the services sought
  and/or services of a substantially similar nature or  purpose,  if  any,
  and  the  headcount  of  employees  within  such titles who perform such
  services.
    c. If an agency intends to issue an invitation for bids,  request  for
  proposal,  or  other  solicitation,  or  renew  or  extend  an  existing
  contract, but the mayor fails to include  such  prospective  invitation,
  request,  solicitation,  renewal  or extension in the plan and schedule,
  the mayor shall provide public notice  sixty  days  before  such  agency
  issues  such  invitation,  request, or solicitation, or enters into such
  renewal or extension. Such notice, which shall be posted on the  mayor's
  office  of  contract  services  website  and  in  the city record, shall
  include: (i) information specific  to  the  prospective  invitation  for

  bids,  request  for  proposal, or other solicitation, including, but not
  limited to, the nature of services sought,  the  term  of  the  proposed
  contract,  the method of the solicitation the agency intends to utilize,
  the  civil  service  and/or job titles within the agency who perform the
  services sought and/or services of a  substantially  similar  nature  or
  purpose,  if  any, and the headcount of employees within such titles who
  perform such services; or (ii)  information  specific  to  the  proposed
  contract  renewal  or  extension,  including,  but  not  limited to, any
  modifications sought to the nature of the services performed  under  the
  contract,  the  term  of  the proposed renewed or extended contract, the
  reason(s) the agency intends to renew or extend such contract, the civil
  service and/or job titles within the agency  who  perform  the  services
  sought  and/or services of a substantially similar nature or purpose, if
  any, and the headcount of employees within such titles who perform  such
  services.
    b. 1. Except as provided for in sections three hundred fourteen, three
  hundred fifteen and three hundred sixteen, contracts shall be awarded by
  competitive  sealed  bidding  under  such  rules as shall be made by the
  procurement policy board, except that, in a special case as  defined  in
  subdivision  b of this section, the head of an agency proposing to award
  such contract may  order  otherwise  in  accordance  with  policies  and
  procedures established by the procurement policy board.
    2.  A  determination  by  the  head  of  an  agency  to use other than
  competitive sealed bidding except as  provided  for  by  sections  three
  hundred  fourteen  and  three  hundred sixteen shall be made in writing,
  stating the reasons why competitive sealed bidding is not practicable or
  not advantageous and why the method of procurement selected pursuant  to
  section three hundred seventeen is the most competitive alternative that
  is  appropriate  under  the  circumstances. The head of the agency shall
  include the determination or a  summary  of  the  determination  in  the
  notice of solicitation, or for an emergency procurement in the notice of
  award,  required  to  be  published  pursuant  to  section three hundred
  twenty-five of this chapter.
    c. 1. For the purposes of this chapter, the term "special case"  shall
  be  defined  as a situation in which it is either not practicable or not
  advantageous to the city to use competitive sealed bidding  for  one  of
  the following reasons:
    i.  specifications cannot be made sufficiently definite and certain to
  permit selection based on price alone;
    ii. judgment is required in evaluating competing proposals, and it  is
  in  the  best  interest  of  the  city  to require a balancing of price,
  quality, and other factors;
    iii. the good, service or construction to  be  procured  is  available
  only from a single source;
    iv.   testing  or  experimentation  is  required  with  a  product  or
  technology, or a new source for a product or technology, or to  evaluate
  the service or reliability of such product or technology; or
    v.  such  other  reasons  as defined by rule of the procurement policy
  board.
    2. The procurement policy board may provide by rule that it is  either
  not  practicable or not advantageous to the city, for one of the reasons
  set forth in paragraph one of this subdivision, to procure  a  specified
  type of good, service or construction by competitive sealed bidding.
