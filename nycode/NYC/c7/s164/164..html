Section 164.

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  164.  Procedure  on  application.  a.  Between the fifteenth day of
  January and the twenty-fifth day of May, the tax commission  may  itself
  or  by a commissioner or assessor thereunto authorized by the commission
  or any other person with qualifications relevant to the review  of  real
  property  tax assessments, including real estate and real estate law, as
  determined by the commission and consistent with  state  law,  act  upon
  applications,  compel  the  attendance of witnesses, administer oaths or
  affirmations and examine applicants and other witnesses under  oath.  It
  shall  make rules of practice for proceedings before the tax commission,
  and such rules and regulations as may be appropriate  and  expedient  to
  the  end  that  the taxpayers may have a hearing in the borough in which
  they reside or in which their  property  is  located,  except  that  all
  applications  with  respect  to  property  indicated  on the tax maps by
  identification numbers shall be heard by the tax commission sitting as a
  body at its main office.
    b. The tax commission shall determine the final assesed  valuation  or
  taxable  assessed  valuation,  or  the  actual  assessment or transition
  assessment, or the proper class designation of the real property of each
  applicant. The final assessed valuation or taxable assessed valuation of
  real property may be the same as or less than  the  original  assessment
  or,  if  determined  to  be unlawful, the same shall be ordered stricken
  from the roll or where appropriate entered on the exempt portion of  the
  roll.  If  it is determined that the real property is misclassified, the
  correct class designation or allocation of assessed valuation  shall  be
  entered on the roll.
