Section 172.

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 172. Sanctions.
    a.  The  failure  of  any  party to appear for a conference or hearing
  without having obtained an extension from all the  opposing  parties  or
  the tribunal at least forty-eight hours in advance of such conference or
  hearing  shall  be grounds for the tribunal to enter a decision in favor
  of the opposing party or parties.
    b. The signing of any paper submitted to the  tribunal  constitutes  a
  certificate  by  the signer that the signer has read the paper, and that
  to the best of the signer's knowledge,  information  and  belief  formed
  after  reasonable  inquiry,  the  paper  is well grounded in fact and is
  warranted by existing law or a good faith argument  for  the  extension,
  modification,  or  reversal  of  existing law, and that the paper is not
  interposed for  any  improper  purpose,  such  as  to  harass  or  cause
  unnecessary  delay  or needless increase in the cost of the proceedings.
  If a paper is signed in violation of this section,  the  tribunal,  upon
  motion  or  upon  its  own  initiative, shall impose upon the person who
  signed the paper, a represented party, or both, an appropriate sanction,
  which may include an order to  pay  the  other  party  or  parties  such
  sanction.  The  amount of any sanction shall be related to the amount of
  reasonable expenses, including a reasonable attorney's fee, incurred  by
  the  other  party  or  parties  because  of the serving or filing of the
  paper.
