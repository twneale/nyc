    &sect;  1151.    Effect  of this charter on existing law.  a.  All laws and
  parts of laws relating to or affecting the  city  of  New  York  or  the
  municipalities  consolidated  therein  in  force  when  this  charter as
  amended shall take effect are hereby  repealed  and  superseded  to  the
  extent  that  the  same  are  inconsistent  with  the provisions of this
  charter and no further.
    b.  All other laws and parts of laws shall  continue  in  force  until
  repealed, amended, modified or superseded.
    c.  Insofar as the provisions of this charter are the same in terms or
  in  substance and effect as provisions of law in force when this charter
  shall take effect, relating to or affecting the city of  New  York,  the
  provisions  of this charter are intended to be not a new enactment but a
  continuation of such provisions of law, and this  charter  shall  be  so
  construed and applied.
