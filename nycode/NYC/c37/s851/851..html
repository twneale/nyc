<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  851.  Constitution  and  appointment.  a.  There  shall  be  an art
  commission the members of which shall be the mayor, who  may  appoint  a
  person to represent him and replace such representative at his pleasure,
  the  president  of  the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the president of the
  New York Public Library  (Astor,  Lenox  and  Tilden  foundations),  the
  president  of  the  Brooklyn  Museum,  one  painter,  one  sculptor, one
  architect, and one landscape architect, all of whom shall  be  residents
  of  the city, and three other residents of the city no one of whom shall
  be a painter, sculptor, architect, landscape architect or active  member
  of any other profession in the fine arts.
    b.  All the members of the commission shall serve without compensation
  for their service on the commission.  Those  whose  service  is  not  ex
  officio  shall  be  appointed  by the mayor from a list of not less than
  three times the number to be appointed, such list to be submitted by the
  Fine Arts Federation of New York. In case the Fine Arts Federation shall
  fail to present a list of nominees within three  months  from  the  time
  when  a vacancy occurs, the mayor shall appoint without such nomination.
  In case the mayor shall fail to appoint within one year  from  the  time
  when  a  vacancy  occurs, such vacancy shall be filled by the commission
  for any balance of the unexpired term.
    c. In all matters which come before the commission pertaining to  work
  under  the  special charge of an agency, the head of such agency may act
  as a member of the commission. Each president of an institution  who  is
  an ex officio member may, by a writing filed with the executive director
  of  the  commission, appoint a trustee of the institution of which he is
  president to serve in his  place  as  member  of  the  commission.  Such
  appointment  shall  be revocable at any time by such president and shall
  terminate whenever he ceases to be president.
