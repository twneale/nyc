<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 856. Maintenance, repair, removal, relocation or alteration of works
  of  art.  a.  The commission shall periodically examine all works of art
  belonging  to  the  city,  shall  make,  request  or  approve   detailed
  recommendations  for  their  cleaning, maintenance and repair, and shall
  have general and curatorial supervision over such works of art belonging
  to the city and their cleaning,  maintenance  and  repair.    Except  as
  provided in subdivision d, no cleaning, restoration, repair, alteration,
  removal  or  relocation  of  any  work  of  art shall be contracted for,
  commenced, or prosecuted, unless approved in writing by the  commission.
  Except  as  provided  in  subdivision  d,  the commission shall have the
  authority to bar final payment for such work if  the  president  or  the
  executive  director  of  the  commission certifies that the work has not
  been  completed  substantially  in  accordance  with  the   commission's
  approval.
    b.  If  a  city  agency fails to expend funds allocated for the proper
  maintenance of works of art, or  allows  undue  deterioration  to  occur
  which  threatens  the visual and structural integrity of any work of art
  under its jurisdiction, the commission shall be authorized to review the
  procedures governing the care of said work and may request the agency to
  relocate such work to a suitable location approved by the commission.
    c. Before any work of art is repaired, altered,  demolished,  removed,
  or  relocated,  the  art  commission  shall  be  notified  and  given an
  opportunity, not to exceed sixty days, to pass  on  the  disposition  of
  such  work  of  art.  The commission may, with the consent of the mayor,
  order the  work  of  art  to  be  preserved.    Except  as  provided  in
  subdivision  d,  no work of art shall be altered, demolished, removed or
  relocated without the written approval of the commission.
    d. In case the immediate removal, repair or relocation of any existing
  work of art shall be deemed necessary by the mayor, he may  require  the
  commission  to pass on its disposition within an emergency period, which
  shall be not less than three business days after the receipt of  written
  notice  from him. In case of the commission's failure to act within such
  period, he may authorize the removal, repair or relocation without  such
  action.
