    &sect; 1171.  Board of collective bargaining.  There shall be in the office
  of  collective  bargaining a board of collective bargaining, which shall
  consist of seven members.   Two members  of  the  board  shall  be  city
  members,  two  members  of  the  board shall be labor members, and three
  members of the board, of whom one shall be chairman, shall be  impartial
  members.   The mayor shall have the power to appoint the city members of
  the board to serve at his pleasure, and the labor members of  the  board
  from designations by the municipal labor committee.  Each labor and city
  member  shall  have  an alternate, who shall be appointed and removed in
  the same manner as the member  for  whom  he  is  the  alternate.    The
  chairman  and  other impartial members shall be elected by the unanimous
  vote of the city and labor members,  and  shall  serve  for  three  year
  terms,  provided,  that  of  the  impartial  members  first elected, the
  chairman shall serve for  a  term  ending  on  January  first,  nineteen
  hundred  seventy,  one  member  shall serve for a term ending on January
  first nineteen hundred sixty-nine, and one member shall serve for a term
  ending on January first, nineteen hundred sixty-eight.
    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a labor member may not  be
  removed  from  the  board  except  upon  request  of the municipal labor
  committee, or except for cause, as hereinafter provided.  Any member may
  be removed for cause by a majority of the  entire  board,  including  at
  least  one  city  member and one labor member, after having been given a
  copy of the charges against him and an opportunity to be heard in person
  or by counsel in his defense  upon  not  less  than  ten  days'  notice.
  Vacancies  in  the  office  of  a city member or a labor member shall be
  filled in the same manner as herein provided for appointment.  Vacancies
  in the office  of  an  impartial  member  occurring  otherwise  than  by
  expiration  of  term  shall  be filled by unanimous vote of the city and
  labor members for the unexpired balance of the term.
