  independence, integrity and  civic  commitment.    Appointments  of  all
  members,  except  for  the  chair,  shall  be  subject to the advice and
  consent of the council.  For such appointments by officials  other  than
  the  mayor,  the  procedure  for obtaining the advice and consent of the
  council shall be the same as  the  procedure  provided  for  in  section

  in section one hundred ninety-one, no member shall hold any  other  city
  office.    Members other than the chair shall be appointed for a term of
  five years; provided, however, that of the members other than the chair,
  one member appointed by the mayor and one member appointed by a  borough
  president  shall serve for terms to expire on the thirtieth day of June,

  member  appointed by a borough president shall serve for terms to expire
  on the thirtieth day of June, nineteen hundred  ninety-two;  one  member

  population.
    e. The city planning commission shall oversee implementation  of  laws
  that  require  environmental  reviews of actions taken by the city.  The
