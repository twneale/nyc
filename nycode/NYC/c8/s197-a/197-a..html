Section 197-a.

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  197-a. Plans. a. Plans for the development, growth, and improvement
  of the city and of its boroughs and community districts may be  proposed
  by  (1)  the mayor, (2) the city planning commission, (3) the department
  of city planning, (4) a borough president with respect to  land  located
  within  his  or  her  borough,  (5) a borough board with respect to land
  located within its borough, or (6) a community  board  with  respect  to
  land  located  within its community district. A community board, borough
  board or borough president that proposes any such plan shall submit  the
  plan  together  with  a  written  recommendation  to  the  city planning
  commission for determinations pursuant to subdivision b of this section.
  Any such submission may be made by a community board, borough  board  or
  borough  president  only  after the board or borough president proposing
  such a plan has held a public hearing on the plan.
    b. The city planning commission shall adopt rules establishing minimum
  standards for the form and content of plans  pursuant  to  this  section
  within  a  reasonable  time period after the first day of July, nineteen
  hundred ninety. Upon receipt of a plan proposed pursuant to this section
  by a community board, borough  board  or  borough  president,  the  city
  planning  commission  shall,  within a reasonable time period, determine
  whether such plan satisfies the standards established in such rules  and
  is  consistent  with sound planning policy. If the commission makes such
  determinations with respect to a plan submitted by a community board, it
  shall prepare or cause to be prepared any environmental analysis of such
  plan required by law to enable the  city  planning  commission  and  the
  council to act on the plan pursuant to subdivision d of this section. If
  the  city  planning  commission makes the determinations provided for in
  this subdivision with respect to a plan, such plan shall be referred  to
  the  department  of city planning for circulation and review pursuant to
  subdivisions c and d of this section.
    c. All plans proposed pursuant to this section shall  be  referred  to
  the department of city planning for circulation by the department to all
  affected  community boards, all affected borough boards and all affected
  borough presidents for review and written  recommendation,  except  that
  any  such  plan  need  not  be circulated to the agency or official that
  proposed such plan. All affected community boards and borough boards  to
  which  such  a  plan is referred shall hold a public hearing on any such
  plan, except that in the case of a plan that includes an entire  borough
  or  land  in more than one borough, only one public hearing need be held
  in each affected borough. The city planning commission  shall  establish
  by rule the procedures and schedule for review of such plans, consistent
  with  the provisions of this section. A community board or borough board
  may review a plan which does not involve land so located as  to  require
  its review if in its judgment the plan significantly affects the welfare
  of  the  district  or  borough served by such board. In such a case, the
  plan and any written recommendations  relative  thereto  shall  be  made
  available  to  such board on request. Such board may hold its own public
  hearing on such plan if it  desires  and  may  submit  its  own  written
  recommendations in regard thereto to the city planning commission.
    d. Within a reasonable time period following review and recommendation
  of  a  plan pursuant to subdivision c of this section, the city planning
  commission shall (1) review such plan, (2) hold a public hearing on such
  plan, and (3) by  resolution  approve,  approve  with  modifications  or
  disapprove  such plan. If the commission has approved a plan or approved
  a plan with modifications, such plan shall  be  subject  to  review  and
  action  by  the  council pursuant to section one hundred ninety-seven-d.
  The council may by a two-thirds vote  approve  a  plan  which  the  city
  planning commission disapproved or on which the commission has failed to
  act  if  the  mayor  so requests. Upon the filing by the mayor of such a

  request with the commission and the council, the commission shall within
  five days file with the council a copy of its decision together  with  a
  copy  of the plan. Copies of approved plans shall be filed with the city
  clerk, the department of city planning, the affected borough presidents,
  the affected borough boards and the affected community boards.
