    &sect;  203.  Criteria for location of city facilities.  a.  Not later than
  the first day  of  July,  nineteen  hundred  ninety,  the  mayor,  after
  consulting with each of the borough presidents, shall file with the city
  planning  commission  proposed  rules establishing criteria for (1)  the
  location of new city  facilities  and  (2)  the  significant  expansion,
  closing  or  significant  reduction  in  size  or  capacity  for service
  delivery of existing facilities.   The criteria shall   be  designed  to
  further  the  fair  distribution  among  communities  of the burdens and
  benefits associated with  city  facilities,  consistent  with  community
  needs for services and efficient and cost effective delivery of services
  and  with  due  regard  for  the  social  and  economic  impacts of such
  facilities upon the areas surrounding the sites.  Not later than  thirty
  days  after  the  filing  of  such  proposed  rules,  the  city planning
  commission shall publish a notice of proposed rule making under  section
  one  thousand  forty-three with regard to such rules, as proposed by the
  mayor or as proposed  to  be  modified  by  the  commission.    Promptly
  thereafter,  the  commission shall approve or approve with modifications
  the rules and shall file the rules as approved with the council.
    b. At any time after the adoption of such criteria, the  mayor,  after
  consulting  with the borough presidents, may submit to the city planning
  commission proposed amendments to the rules.  Not later than thirty days
  after  the  filing  of  such  proposed  amendments,  the  city  planning
  commission  shall publish a notice of proposed rule making under section
  one thousand forty-three with regard to such amendments, as proposed  by
  the  mayor  or  as  proposed to be modified by the commission.  Promptly
  thereafter, the commission shall approve, approve with modifications  or
  determine  not  to  approve  the  amendments and shall file any approved
  amended rules with the council.
    c.   For purposes of  this  chapter,  "city  facility"  shall  mean  a
  facility  used  or occupied or to be used or occupied to meet city needs
  that is located on real property owned or  leased  by  the  city  or  is
  operated by the city or pursuant to a written agreement on behalf of the
  city.
