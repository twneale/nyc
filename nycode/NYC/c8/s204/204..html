    &sect;  204.  Citywide  statement of needs. a. Each year not later than the
  fifteenth day of November,  the  mayor  shall  submit  to  the  council,
  borough  presidents,  borough  boards  and  community  boards a citywide
  statement of needs concerning city  facilities  prepared  in  accordance
  with  the  criteria  established  pursuant to section two hundred three.
  Copies of the statement shall also be made available to  the  public  in
  the  main  branch  of  the public library in each borough. The statement
  shall identify by agency and program: (1) all new  city  facilities  and
  all  significant expansions of city facilities for which the mayor or an
  agency intends to make or propose an expenditure or to select or propose
  a site during the ensuing two fiscal years and (2) all  city  facilities
  which  the  city plans to close or to reduce significantly in size or in
  capacity for service delivery during the ensuing two fiscal years.
    b. With respect to the city facilities referred to in  clause  one  of
  subdivision a of this section, the statement of needs shall describe for
  each proposed new city facility or significant expansion: (1) the public
  purpose  to  be served thereby, (2) the size and nature of the facility,
  (3) the proposed location by borough and, if practicable,  by  community
  district  or group of community districts, and (4) the specific criteria
  to be used in locating the new facility or expansion.
    c. With respect to the city facilities referred to in  clause  two  of
  subdivision  a  of  this  section, the statement of needs shall describe
  with respect to each such  city  facility:  (1)  the  reasons  for  such
  proposed  closing  or  reduction, (2) the location, and (3) the specific
  criteria for selecting the city facility for closure or for reduction in
  size or capacity for service delivery.
    d. The statement of needs shall be accompanied by a map together  with
  explanatory  text,  indicating  (1)  the location and current use of all
  city-owned real property, (2) all  final  commitments  relating  to  the
  disposition  or  future  use  of  city-owned  real  property,  including
  assignments  by  the  department  of  citywide  administrative  services
  pursuant  to  clause  b  of subdivision three of section sixteen hundred
  two, and (3) to the extent such information is available  to  the  city,
  (i) the location of health and social service facilities operated by the
  state  of  New  York  or  the  federal government or pursuant to written
  agreement on behalf of the state or the federal government; and (ii) the
  location of transportation or waste management  facilities  operated  by
  public  entities  or  by private entities pursuant to written agreements
  with  public  entities,  or  by  other  private  entities  that  provide
  comparable services. Information which can be presented most effectively
  in  text  may  be  presented  in  this  manner.  In  addition  to  being
  transmitted with the statement of needs pursuant  to  subdivision  a  of
  this section, such map shall be kept on file with the department of city
  planning  and  shall be available for public inspection and copying. The
  map shall be updated on at least an annual basis.
    e. Preparation of the statement of needs. (1) Annually on such date as
  the mayor shall  direct,  each  agency  shall  submit  to  the  mayor  a
  statement  containing all the information required to be included in the
  statement of  needs  for  the  ensuing  two  fiscal  years  pursuant  to
  subdivisions  a,  b  and  c  of  this section that relates to the plans,
  jurisdiction and responsibility of such agency. Such statements shall be
  known as the departmental statements of need  for  city  facilities.  In
  preparing  such  departmental  statements  of  needs,  each agency shall
  review and consider the district needs statements submitted by community
  boards pursuant to paragraph ten of  subdivision  d  of  section  twenty
  eight  hundred  and the statements of budget priorities submitted by the
  community boards pursuant to section two hundred thirty.

    (2) The mayor, assisted  by  the  department  of  city  planning,  the
  department  of  design  and  construction and the department of citywide
  administrative services, shall review such  departmental  statements  of
  need  and  use  them to prepare the statement of needs. In preparing the
  statement  of  needs,  the  mayor  shall  apply the criteria established
  pursuant to section two hundred three.
    f. Upon receipt of the statement of needs pursuant to subdivision a of
  this section, each community board and borough  president  shall  review
  the statement of needs. Each community board shall make the statement of
  needs  available  to  the  public  and  conduct  a public hearing on the
  statement of needs. Each community board  and  borough  president  shall
  have  the  right  to  submit  comments  on the statement of needs to the
  department of city  planning  within  ninety  days  of  receipt  of  the
  statement.  Each  borough  president shall have the right, within ninety
  days of receipt of the statement of needs, to submit a written statement
  to the mayor proposing locations for  any  new  city  facilities  to  be
  located  in  his  or her borough pursuant to the statement of needs. All
  such locations proposed by a borough president shall be located  in  his
  or  her borough and shall be certified by the borough president as being
  consistent  with  the  specific  criteria  for  the  location  of   city
  facilities  contained  in  the  statement of needs and with the criteria
  established pursuant to section two  hundred  three.  Each  city  agency
  shall consider such written statements in taking actions with respect to
  matters included in the statement of needs.
    g.  Whenever an application involving a new city facility is submitted
  to the department of city planning pursuant to paragraph  five,  ten  or
  eleven  of  subdivision  a  of  section  one hundred ninety-seven-c, the
  applicant shall include as part of the application a  statement  of  (1)
  how  the proposed action satisfies the criteria for the location of city
  facilities established  pursuant  to  section  two  hundred  three,  (2)
  whether the proposed action is consistent with the most recent statement
  of  needs,  and  (3)  whether the proposed action is consistent with any
  written statements or  comments  submitted  by  borough  presidents  and
  community  boards in response to the statement of needs. If the proposed
  action is  not  consistent  with  the  criteria  for  location  of  city
  facilities,  the  statement  of needs, or any such written statements or
  comments submitted in response to the statement  of  needs,  the  agency
  shall  include as part of its application a statement of the reasons for
  any such inconsistencies. If the proposed new facility is  not  referred
  to in the statement of needs, the applicant shall submit to the affected
  borough  president  a  description of the public purpose to be served by
  the city facility, its proposed location,  the  appropriation  (if  any)
  that the agency intends to use in connection with the facility, the size
  and nature of the facility and the specific criteria for the location of
  the  facility.  The  affected  borough  president  shall have the right,
  within thirty days of the submission of such description, to propose  an
  alternative  location  in  his  or  her  borough  for  the proposed city
  facility, provided that the borough president  shall  certify  that  the
  alternative  location  satisfies  the  criteria  for  location  of  city
  facilities under section two hundred three and the specific criteria for
  locating the facility in the statement of needs. The application for the
  proposed  site  selection,  disposition  or  acquisition  shall  not  be
  certified  and  shall  not  be  reviewed pursuant to section one hundred
  ninety-seven-c until at least thirty days after the submission  of  such
  information  to  the affected borough president. A borough president may
  elect to waive the right to such thirty-day review period.
    h. The mayor's management report, prepared pursuant to section twelve,
  shall include a review of the implementation of the statement of  needs.

  Such  review  shall consist of (1) a list of the proposed actions in the
  statement of needs that have been  implemented  and  of  those  proposed
  actions  that  have  not  been  implemented and (2) a description of the
  proposed  actions  in the statement of needs which have been implemented
  in a manner significantly  different  from  what  was  proposed  in  the
  statement of needs and the reasons therefor.
