    &sect;  813.  City civil service commission. a. There shall be a city civil
  service commission, consisting of five members, not more than  three  of
  whom  shall  be  members  of  the same political party. Members shall be
  appointed by the mayor, from a  list  of  nominations  provided  by  the
  screening  committee  established  pursuant  to  subdivision  b  of this
  section, for overlapping terms  of  six  years.  Of  the  members  first
  appointed,  two shall serve for two years and two for four years and one
  for six years. The members shall be removable in the manner provided for
  members of a municipal civil service commission  in  the  civil  service
  law.  A vacancy in such commission shall be filled in the same manner as
  regular appointments for the balance of the unexpired term.   The  mayor
  shall  designate  a  member  as  chair and vice chair, respectively, for
  one-year terms. Within appropriations for such purposes, the members  of
  the commission shall be reimbursed on a per diem basis for attendance at
  regularly scheduled meetings and hearings of the commission.
    b.  There  shall  be  a  screening committee which shall submit to the
  mayor a list of nominees, which shall include persons with knowledge  or
  experience  of  the  civil  service  system, or personnel management, or
  compensation practices, from which the mayor shall make appointments  to
  the  city  civil  service  commission.  Such  screening  committee shall
  consist of six members, of whom four shall be appointed by the mayor and
  two shall be appointed by the municipal labor committee.  The  screening
  committee  shall  submit the list of nominees upon the occurrence of any
  vacancy on the  commission  or  at  least  three  months  prior  to  the
  expiration of the term of any incumbent member.
    c.  The  commission shall appoint a counsel, who shall not be employed
  or retained by any other city agency, and may appoint  a  secretary  and
  such  other  subordinates  as  may be necessary within the appropriation
  therefor.
    d. The civil service commission shall  have  the  power  to  hear  and
  determine appeals by any person aggrieved by any action or determination
  of  the commissioner made pursuant to paragraphs three, four, five, six,
  seven and eight of subdivision a or paragraph five of subdivision  b  of
  section  eight  hundred fourteen of this chapter and may affirm, modify,
  or reverse such action or determination.  Any such appeal shall be taken
  by application in writing to the commission within thirty days after the
  action or determination appealed from. The commission  shall  also  have
  the  powers and responsibilities of a municipal civil service commission
  under section seventy-six of the state civil service law. In  accordance
  with  the  requirements  of  chapter  forty-five,  the  commission shall
  promulgate  rules  of  procedure,  including  rules  establishing   time
  schedules,  for  the  hearings  and  determinations  authorized  by this
  section.
    e. The commission, on its own  initiative,  or  upon  request  of  the
  mayor, council or commissioner, shall have the power and duty to conduct
  reviews,  studies, or analyses of the administration of personnel in the
  city, including the classification of titles by the commissioner.
    f. The commission shall prepare and transmit  directly  to  the  mayor
  departmental  estimates  as  required by section two hundred thirty-one.
  The mayor shall include such proposed appropriations for the  commission
  as  a  separate  agency  in the preliminary and executive budgets as are
  sufficient for the commission to fulfill the obligations assigned to  it
  by this charter or other law.
