  commission pursuant to this chapter:
    (1) To recruit personnel;
    (2) To make studies in  regard  to  the  grading  and  classifying  of
  positions  in  the  civil service, establish criteria and guidelines for
  allocating positions to an existing class of positions,  and  grade  and
  establish classes of positions;
    (3)  To  schedule  and conduct examinations for positions in the civil
  service;
    (4) To establish, promulgate and certify eligible lists in the  manner

  rules of the commissioner;
    (6)  To  investigate applicants for positions in the civil service; to
  review their qualifications, and to revoke or rescind any  certification
  or  appointment  by  reason  of the disqualification of the applicant or
  appointee under the provisions of the civil service law, and  the  rules
  of the commissioner or any other law;
    (7)  To  review  any  appointment  of persons as provisional employees
  within sixty days after  appointment  to  assure  compliance  with  this
  charter,  the  civil  service  law,  and  any  rule or regulation issued

  including  provisional,  seasonal, per-diem and part-time employees, new

  programs.

  as provided in subdivision c of section eight hundred thirteen;
    (6)  To  delegate  to  the  head  of  an  agency  personnel management
  functions assigned to the commissioner  where  such  delegation  is  not
  otherwise prohibited by the civil service law, and pursuant to terms and
  conditions prescribed by the commissioner;
    (7)  To  administer personnel programs of a city-wide nature or common
  to two or more departments where  administration  by  separate  agencies
  would be impracticable and uneconomical;
    (8)  To  annually  publish  and  submit  to the mayor, council and the
  commission on equal employment practices a report on the  activities  of
  the  department of citywide administrative services and city agencies to
  provide fair and effective affirmative employment  practices  to  ensure
  equal  employment  opportunity  for minority group members and women who
  are employed by, or who seek employment with, city agencies. Such report
  shall include, but not be limited to, an analysis of the city government
  workforce and applicants  for  such  employment  by  agency,  title  and
  classification;  a  description  of  each agency's employment practices,
  policies and programs; an analysis of the effectiveness  of  the  city's
  efforts  to  provide fair and effective affirmative employment practices

  women  who  are employed by, or who seek employment with, city agencies;
  and such legislative, programmatic and budgetary recommendations for the
  development, implementation or improvement of  such  activities  as  the
  commissioner deems appropriate.

    c. The commissioner shall promulgate rules and regulations relating to
  the  personnel  policies,  programs and activities of city government in
  furtherance of and consistent with the state civil service law and  this
  chapter.  The  commissioner  shall  transmit  to the state civil service
  commission   each   proposed  rule  which  must  be  submitted  to  such
  commission, including any which establishes or  reclassifies  titles  in
  the  non-competitive or exempt class, within sixty days after the public
  hearing has been held on such rule.
    d. The commissioner shall, at the time requested  by  the  city  civil
  service commission or the equal employment practices commission, provide
  each  commission  with  all  the information which such commission deems
  necessary to fulfill the duties assigned  to  it  by  the  charter.  The
  provisions  of this subdivision shall not apply to any information which
  is required by law to be kept confidential or which is protected by  the
  privileges  for  attorney-client communications, attorney work products,
  or material prepared for litigation.
    e. The commissioner shall submit a quarterly report to the mayor,  the
  council, the civil service commission and the equal employment practices
  commission. Such report shall specify, by agency and by title, including
  temporary titles:
    (1) the number of provisional employees at the end of the second month
  of the quarter;
    (2) the length of time such provisional employees have served in their
  positions; and
    (3)  the  actions  taken  by  the  city  to  reduce the number of such
  provisional employees and the length of their service in such positions.
  Such reports shall  be  submitted  by  the  last  day  of  March,  June,
  September, and December of each year.
