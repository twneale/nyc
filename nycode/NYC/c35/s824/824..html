<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  824. Real property. With respect to real property, the commissioner
  shall have the following powers and duties:
    (a) to purchase, lease, condemn or otherwise acquire real property for
  the city, subject to the approval of the  mayor,  and  to  sell,  lease,
  exchange  or  otherwise dispose of real property of the city, subject to
  the requirements of section three hundred  eighty-four  and  subject  to
  review  and approval either pursuant to section one hundred ninety-five,
  if applicable, or pursuant to sections one  hundred  ninety-seven-c  and
  one  hundred  ninety-seven-d.  No  such purchase, lease, condemnation or
  other acquisition shall be authorized until a public  hearing  has  been
  held  with respect to such acquisition after the publishing of notice in
  the City Record at least ten days but  not  more  than  thirty  days  in
  advance  of  such  hearing;  provided,  however,  that in the case of an
  acquisition by purchase  or  condemnation,  no  such  hearing  shall  be
  required  if  a  public hearing is held with respect to such purchase or
  condemnation pursuant to any other requirement of law. In the case of  a
  lease  in which the city is to be the tenant, the notice for the hearing
  required in this subdivision shall include a statement of  the  location
  and  proposed  use  of the premises, and the term and annual rent of the
  proposed lease. Before submitting an application pursuant to section one
  hundred ninety-seven-c for an acquisition or a disposition  pursuant  to
  this  section,  the  commissioner  shall  take  into  consideration  the
  criteria for location of city facilities established pursuant to section
  two hundred three. If two years, not including time spent in litigation,
  have  elapsed  between  (1)  the  final  approval  of  a  dispostion  or
  acquisition  pursuant  to section one hundred ninety-seven-c and section
  one  hundred  ninety-seven-d  and  (2)  execution  of  an  agreement  in
  connection  with  such dispostion or acquisition, a public hearing shall
  be held on the proposed acquisition or disposition after the  publishing
  of notice in the City Record at least forty-five days in advance of such
  hearing;
    (b)  to assign and reallocate to city agencies space and real property
  owned or leased by the city, to establish comprehensive  and  continuing
  programs  and  standards for utilization of space owned or leased by the
  city and to conduct surveys of space utilization;
    (c) to manage all real property  of  the  city  not  used  for  public
  purposes,  including real property acquired for a public purpose and not
  being currently utilized for such  purpose,  except  wharf  property  or
  other  real  property  under the jurisdiction of the department of small
  business  services,  the  department   of   housing   preservation   and
  development,  the New York city transit authority, and the New York city
  housing authority by virtue of an authorization  granted  by  the  mayor
  pursuant  to  the provisions of subdivision three of section one hundred
  twenty-five of the public housing law, or except as  otherwise  provided
  by  law,  real  property under the jurisdiction of the triborough bridge
  and  tunnel  authority;  provided,  that  the  commissioner   shall   be
  responsible  for the management, leasing or permitting of any parcels of
  wharf property and water front property as provided in  any  designation
  made  by  the  commissioner  of  small  business  services  pursuant  to
  paragraph b of subdivision two of section thirteen hundred one  of  this
  charter;
    (d)  to  exercise  and  perform such other powers and duties as may be
  prescribed by law or delegated to the commissioner in  relation  to  the
  acquisition,   disposition,   management,  site  selection,  assignment,
  demolition or other treatment of real property of the city;
    (e) to  employ,  where  desirable,  managing  agents  to  manage  city
  properties and collect rents therefrom and pay bills;

    (f)  to  keep,  maintain  and  annually update a master list of leases
  wherein the city or its agencies is a tenant.  Such  master  list  shall
  contain  at least the following information: name and address of lessor,
  location wherein lease property is situated, base rent, square  footage,
  escalation  provisions,  and  any other information which the department
  deems necessary and appropriate.
