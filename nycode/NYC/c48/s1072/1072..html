    q.  to  provide  to  the  public at no charge on the city's website an
  interactive map, updated as often as practicable and necessary  but  not
  less than once per week, displaying the following:
    1.  Permitted  and  approved street closures that do not allow for the

  to  closures for special events, crane operations and other construction
  work, film shoots and paving operations; and
    2. Parking regulations. The information related to  paragraph  (1)  of
  this  subdivision  shall  be  searchable  and sortable by time, date and
  borough, except that street closures for crane operations,  construction
  work  and paving operations shall have the notation "subject to closure"
  during times where closure has been permitted  and  approved  but  where
  such  closure  may or may not occur on a particular day. All information
  required by this subdivision shall be available on the city's website as
  soon as practicable but in no case less than one week prior to any  such
  closure  or  change,  except  closures which were applied for or planned
  less than one week prior to any such closure or change, which  shall  be
  available on such interactive map within seventy-two hours of the permit
  and  approval  of  such  closure.  Where a permitted and approved street
  closure is due to a  special  event,  the  sponsor  of  the  event  with
  appropriate  contact  information  shall  be  provided  as  part of such
  interactive map. For the purposes of  this  subdivision,  special  event
  shall  mean  any  street  fair,  block  party  or  festival  on a public
  street(s) where such activity may interfere with or obstruct the  normal
  use by vehicular traffic of such street(s); and
    r.  to  provide  to the public, at no charge on the city's website, an
  interactive crime map that, for each segment of a street bounded by  one
  or  more  intersections  and/or  a  terminus, shall visually display the
  aggregate monthly, yearly and year-to-date totals for  the  current  and
  the  most  recent  prior  calendar years for each class of crime that is
  reported to the New York city police department, or for which an  arrest
  was  made,  including crimes that occurred in parks and subway stations.
  Such map shall be searchable by address, zip code, and patrol  precinct.
  All  information  required by this subdivision shall be available on the
  city's website as soon as practicable but in no case more than one month
  after a crime complaint has been filed. The mayor shall ensure that  all
  agencies  provide the department with such assistance and information as
  the department requires to compile and update the interactive crime map.
