  board may appoint an executive director to serve at  its  pleasure  with
  such  duties  and  responsibilities  as  the board may assign, and other
  professional, clerical, and support personnel within appropriations  for
  such  purpose. The commissioner shall designate such of the department's
  stenographic, clerical and other assistance  to  the  board  as  may  be

    4. The evaluation of departmental performance.
    d. The board, annually and at such other times as  it  may  determine,
  shall  submit  to  the mayor, the council, and the commissioner reports,
  findings and  recommendations  in  regard  to  the  matters  within  its
  jurisdiction.
    e.  The board shall establish minimum standards for the care, custody,
  correction, treatment, supervision, and discipline of all  persons  held
  or  confined  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the department; and it shall
  promulgate such minimum standards in rules and regulations after  giving
  the  mayor  and commissioner an opportunity to review and comment on the
  proposed standards, or amendments or additions to such standards.
    f. The board shall establish procedures for the hearing of grievances,
  complaints or requests for assistance (1) by or on behalf of any  person
  held  or confined under the jurisdiction of the department or (2) by any
  employee of the department. The board,  or  by  written  designation,  a
  member  of the board or the executive director, may conduct hearings, or
  study  or  investigate  any  matter  within  the  jurisdiction  of   the
  department, and the board may make recommendations and submit reports of
  its findings to the appropriate authorities.

  persons,  and  conduct  public  or   private   hearings,   studies   and

  investigations.  The  board  may  institute  proceedings  in  a court of
  appropriate  jurisdiction  to  enforce  its  subpoena  power  and  other
  authority pursuant to this section.
