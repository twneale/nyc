Section 1137.

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  1137.  Public Policy. It is hereby declared to be the public policy
  of the city of New York to limit the time elected officials can serve as
  mayor, public  advocate,  comptroller,  borough  president  and  council
  member  so  that  there is more opportunity for citizen participation in
  the legislative and executive branches  and  the  airing  of  a  greater
  diversity  of  ideas.  It  is  further declared that this policy is most
  appropriately served by limiting the time such officials  can  serve  to
  not  more  than  two consecutive full terms. It is further declared that
  public confidence in  government  should  be  protected  by  restricting
  amendments  that  would  affect  the  application  of term limits to any
  elected official then in office.
