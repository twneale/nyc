Section 1138.

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  1138. Term Limits. a. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
  contained in this charter, no person shall be eligible to be elected  to
  or  serve  in the office of mayor, public advocate, comptroller, borough
  president or council member if that  person  had  previously  held  such
  office  for  two or more consecutive full terms, unless one full term or
  more has elapsed since that person last held such office.
    b. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, no  local  law
  may  be  enacted  by  the  city  council,  including  but not limited to
  amendment of the provisions of this chapter, if  such  local  law  would
  alter  or  permit alteration of the term limit set forth in this section
  as such limit applies to any person then serving in the office of mayor,
  public advocate, comptroller, borough president or council member.
    c. Severability. If any provision of this section, or any provision of
  paragraph one of subdivision  k  of  section  eleven  hundred  fifty-two
  relating  to  the  application of this section, shall be held invalid or
  ineffective in whole or  in  part  or  inapplicable  to  any  person  or
  situation,  such  holding  shall  not  affect,  impair or invalidate the
  remainder of this section and such paragraph, and all  other  provisions
  thereof  shall  nevertheless  be  separately and fully effective and the
  application of any such provision to other persons or  situations  shall
  not be affected.
