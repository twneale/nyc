  have been in its final form and upon the desks of the council members at

  its  immediate  passage  and such local law be passed by the affirmative
  vote of two-thirds of all the council members.
    For purposes of this section, a local law shall be deemed to  be  upon
  the  desks  of  the  council  members  if:  it is set forth in a legible
  electronic format by electronic means, and it is available for review in
  such format at the desks of the members. For purposes  of  this  section

  expression; and does not permit additions, deletions or other changes to
