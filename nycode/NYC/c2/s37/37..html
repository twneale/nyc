Section 37.

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  37.  Local laws; action by mayor.  a.  Every local law certified by
  the clerk of the council, after its passage by  the  council,  shall  be
  presented to the mayor for approval.
    b.    If the mayor approves the local law, the mayor shall sign it and
  return it to the clerk; it shall then be deemed to  have  been  adopted.
  If the mayor disapproves it, he or she shall return it to the clerk with
  his  or her objections stated in writing and the clerk shall present the
  same with such objections to the council at its next regular meeting and
  such objections shall be entered in its journal.    The  council  within
  thirty  days  thereafter  may  reconsider  the  same.    If  after  such
  reconsideration the votes of two-thirds of all the  council  members  be
  cast  in  favor of repassing such local law, it shall be deemed adopted,
  notwithstanding the objections of the mayor.  Only one vote shall be had
  upon such reconsideration.  The vote shall be taken by  ayes  and  noes,
  which  shall be entered in the journal.  If within thirty days after the
  local law shall have been presented to  him  or  her,  the  mayor  shall
  neither  approve  nor  return the local law to the clerk with his or her
  objections, it shall be deemed to have been adopted in like manner as if
  the mayor had signed it.  At any time prior to the return of a local law
  by the mayor, the council may recall the same and reconsider its  action
  thereon.
