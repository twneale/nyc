Section 41.

    &sect;  41.  Submission  of local laws or amendments. A proposition for the
  submission of a local law or  an  amendment  to  this  charter  for  the
  approval  of  the  electors  pursuant  to this charter shall contain the
  title of such local law or a brief statement  of  the  subject  of  such
  amendment.  The  city  clerk  with the advice of the corporation counsel
  shall prepare an abstract of  such  local  law  or  amendment  concisely
  stating the title or subject and the purpose and effect thereof in clear
  language,  and  forthwith  shall  transmit  such  proposition  and  such
  abstract to the election officers charged with the  duty  of  publishing
  the  notice  of  and  furnishing  the  supplies  for  such  election.  A
  sufficient number of copies of such abstract shall be printed,  in  such
  manner that the abstract shall appear with the question to appear on the
  ballot in bold type and separately from the text of the proposition, and
  shall  be  delivered with the other election supplies and distributed to
  the electors at the time of  the  registration  of  voters  and  at  the
  election.    If there be more than one such proposition to be voted upon
  at  such  election,  each  such   proposition   shall   be   separately,
  consecutively  and  consistently  numbered  on  the  ballot  and  on the
  abstract. In case of a conflict between two local laws or two amendments
  adopted at the same election, the one receiving the largest  affirmative
  vote shall control.
