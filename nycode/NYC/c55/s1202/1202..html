  required  by  state or federal law or by direction of the mayor pursuant
  to subdivision b of this section, and notwithstanding  any  inconsistent
  provision  of  this charter or the administrative code, the commissioner
  shall have charge and control of and be responsible  for  functions  and
  operations  and  shall  exercise  powers  of  the  city relating to city
  construction projects. Such projects shall include but not be limited to
  the design, construction and alteration of streets and highways, bridges
  and tunnels,  parks  and  recreational  facilities,  sewers  and  sewage
  disposal   plants,  water  supply  and  distribution  structures,  waste
  management facilities, correctional  facilities  and  all  other  public
  buildings,  structures  and  facilities.    The  commissioner shall also
  perform responsibilities as the mayor shall direct with respect  to  the
  acquisition of real or personal property in connection with construction
  or  a capital project, including responsibilities delegated elsewhere by
  the charter or the administrative code, provided that the acquisition of
  real property shall be made in the  same  manner  as  acquisitions  made
  pursuant  to  subdivision  three  of section sixteen hundred two of this
  charter.
    b. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision  of  this  section,  the
  mayor may assign in whole or in part operations and functions related to
  a  particular  construction  project  or particular category or class of
  construction projects to an agency other than the department  of  design
  and  construction,  if  the  mayor determines that it is appropriate for
  such other agency to perform such operations and functions.
