  business enterprises, and ensuring equal employment opportunity by  city
  contractors.   Such   powers   and   functions  shall  include,  without
  limitation, the following:
    1. With respect to business and  economic  development  generally  the
  commissioner shall have the power and duty:
    a. to establish business, industrial and commercial policies, programs

  life of the city;
    b.   to   serve  as  liaison  for  the  city  with  local  development
  corporations, other not-for-profit corporations and all  other  entities
  involved in economic development within the city. In furtherance of this
  function,  the  department  shall  include  in any contract with a local
  development  corporation  or  not-for-profit  corporation  of  which   a

  development  benefits  on  behalf of the city and expending city capital
  appropriations  in  connection  therewith,  a  requirement   that   such
  contracted   entity   submit   to  the  mayor,  the  council,  the  city
  comptroller, the public advocate and the borough presidents  by  January
  31  of  each  year,  a  report  for  the  prior  fiscal year in the form
  prescribed hereunder with regard to projected and  actual  jobs  created
  and   retained  in  connection  with  any  project  undertaken  by  such
  contracted entity for the purpose of the creation or retention of  jobs,
  whether  or  not  such  project involves the expenditure of city capital
  appropriations, if in connection  with  such  project  assistance  to  a
  business  entity was provided by such contracted entity in the form of a
  loan, grant or tax benefit in  excess  of  one  hundred  fifty  thousand
  dollars,  or  a  sale  or  lease of city-owned land where the project is
  estimated to retain or create not less than twenty-five jobs. The report
  shall be for  the  period  commencing  on  the  date  that  the  project
  agreement  and  any other documents applicable to such project have been

  of  assistance over the duration of the project agreement, the amount of
  tax  exempt bonds issued during the current reporting year and the range
  of potential cost of those bonds;  project  assistance  to  be  reported
  shall  include,  but shall not be limited to, PILOT savings, which shall
  be defined for the purposes of this paragraph as the difference  between

  employees within the "non-exempt" category, the percentage of  employees
  earning  up  to twenty-five thousand dollars per year, the percentage of
  employees  earning  more  than  twenty-five  thousand  per  year  up  to
  forty-thousand  dollars per year and the percentage of employees earning

  employees,  the  number  and percentage of employees earning less than a
  living wage, as that term is defined in section 134 of title  6  of  the
  administrative  code  of  the  city  of New York. Reports with regard to
  projects for which assistance was received prior to July  1,  2012  need
  only contain such information required by this paragraph as is available
  to  the  city, can be reasonably derived from available sources, and can
  be reasonably obtained from the business entity to which assistance  was

  provided;  (xiii)  for  the  current reporting year, with respect to the
  entity or entities receiving assistance and their affiliates, the number
  and percentage  of  employees  at  all  sites  covered  by  the  project
  agreement  who  reside in the city of New York. For the purposes of this
  subparagraph, "affiliate" shall mean (i) a business entity in which more
  than fifty percent is owned by, or is subject to a  power  or  right  of
  control  of,  or  is managed by, an entity which is a party to an active
  project agreement, or (ii) a business entity that owns more  than  fifty
  percent  of  an  entity  that is party to an active project agreement or

  projection  of the retained or additional tax revenue to be derived from
  the project for the remainder of the project period; (xv) a list of  all
  commercial   expansion   program  benefits,  industrial  and  commercial

  therefore; (xvii) for business entities for which project assistance was
  provided  by  such contracted entity in the form of a loan, grant or tax
  benefit of one hundred fifty thousand dollars or less, the  data  should
  be  included  in  such report in the aggregate using the format required
  for all other loans, grants or tax benefits; and (xviii)  an  indication
  of  the sources of all data relating to numbers of jobs. For projects in
  existence prior to the effective date of  this  local  law,  information
  that  business  entities  were not required to report to such contracted
  entity at the time that the project agreement and  any  other  documents
  applicable  to  such  project were executed need not be contained in the
  report.
    The report shall be submitted by the statutory due date and shall bear
  the actual date that the report was submitted. Such report shall include
  a statement explaining any delay in its submission  past  the  statutory
  due  date.  Upon its submission, the report shall simultaneously be made
  available in electronic form on the website of the contracted entity or,
  if no such website is maintained, on the website  of  the  city  of  New
  York,   provided   that   reports  submitted  in  2012  or  after  shall
  simultaneously be made available in a commonly available non-proprietary
  database format on the website of the contracted entity or, if  no  such
  website  is  maintained,  on the website of the city of New York, except
  that any terms and restrictions on the use or resale of city-owned  land
  need  not  be  included  in  such  non-proprietary  database format, and
  provided further that with respect to the report submitted  in  2012  in
  the  commonly  available non-proprietary database format, the contracted
  entity shall include, in such format, the data included in  the  reports
  for  the  period from July 1, 2005 to June 30, 2010. Reports with regard
  to projects for which assistance was rendered prior  to  July  1,  2005,
  need  only  contain  such information required by this subdivision as is
  available to the contracted  entity,  can  be  reasonably  derived  from
  available  sources,  and  can  be  reasonably obtained from the business
  entity to which assistance was provided.
