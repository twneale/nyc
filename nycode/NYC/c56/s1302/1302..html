Section 1302.

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  1302.  Water  front  plans.   a. No marginal street, bulkhead line,
  pierhead line or other similar line demarcating the extent of waterfront
  development  may  be  delineated,  established   or   changed   by   the
  commissioner except in accordance with sections one hundred ninety-eight
  and  one  hundred  ninety-nine  of this charter. Any existing waterfront
  plan containing  such  lines  shall  be  continued  in  effect  and  may
  similarly  be  changed  only  in  accordance  with  sections one hundred
  ninety-eight and one hundred ninety-nine.  The commissioner may apply to
  the city planning commission to incorporate such existing plans for  the
  water  front  or  any  portion thereof into the city map pursuant to the
  procedure for review and approval of a change to the city map. Any plans
  for the water front or portions thereof so incorporated shall thereafter
  be discontinued as separate plans.
    b. No wharf, pier, bulkhead, basin, dock,  slip,  marginal  street  or
  other  structure shall be laid out, built, or rebuilt in the port of New
  York in the area subject to the jurisdiction of the commissioner  except
  in  accordance  with  such plans as changed from time to time, provided,
  that the commissioner, with the approval of the council, may  from  time
  to  time  change  the width or location of any of the piers laid down on
  such plans and build or rebuild temporary wharf structures or license or
  permit the building or rebuilding thereof as may be provided by law.
    c. The commissioner may widen, open, construct, abandon or  close  any
  marginal  street or avenue included in such plans and shall maintain the
  widened portion of such street or avenue, or the new street or avenue as
  a marginal street, and such new street, or such a widened street to  the
  extent  of  the portion so widened, shall not be a public street. Before
  acting under this subdivision, the commissioner shall make a  report  to
  the city planning commission including a map showing any proposed change
  and  such other information as the chair of the city planning commission
  shall require. If the city planning commission makes a finding that  the
  proposed  change  is in accordance with the water front plan or approves
  the change, the commissioner may  proceed  with  it,  but  if  the  city
  planning  commission  makes  a finding that it is not in accordance with
  such plan and disapproves the change, then the  commissioner  shall  not
  proceed   unless  the  council  by  a  two-thirds  vote  authorizes  the
  commissioner to proceed. The city planning commission shall act on  such
  change  within six weeks from the time when it is filed in the office of
  the commission and if it does not act within such six weeks  period  the
  commissioner may proceed with the change.
