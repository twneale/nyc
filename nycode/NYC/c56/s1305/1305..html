  implement  the  purposes of this section. The commissioner shall consult
  with the procurement policy board in drafting and adopting such rules.
    c. The commissioner shall have the following powers and duties:

  opportunity;

    d. The commissioner shall develop appropriate language  for  inclusion
  in  city  contracts  regarding  the subject matter of this section. Such
  contract language shall be reviewed by  the  corporation  counsel.  Such

  provide for appropriate exemptions from such requirements.
    2.  An  employment  report  shall  include,  but  not  be  limited to,
  employment practices, policies, procedures,  statistics  and  collective
  bargaining   agreements.  The  contracting  agency  shall  transmit  the
  employment report to the commissioner after the selection of a  proposed
  contractor   or   subcontractor.   The  commissioner  shall  review  all
  employment  reports  to   determine   whether   such   contractors   and
  subcontractors  are  in compliance with the equal employment opportunity
  requirement of local, state and federal law and executive orders.
    3. Except as provided in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of this subdivision,  a

  award the contract or approve the subcontractor until after  a  complete
  employment report has been submitted to the division for its review.
    5.  If  the  commissioner  notifies  the  contracting  agency that the
  division has reason to believe that the contractor or  subcontractor  is
  not in substantial compliance with the requirements of this section, the
  commissioner  may  require  the  contracting  agency  not  to  award the
  contract or approve the subcontractor until the contractor has agreed to
  take appropriate action to come into compliance with such requirements.
    6. The commissioner may by  rule  provide  for  circumstances  when  a
  contract or subcontract may be awarded without the prior approval of the
  division,  which  shall  include  but  not  be  limited  to requirements
  contracts which may be awarded prior to the approval  of  an  employment
  report, subject to the condition that a purchase shall not be made under
  the  contract  until  the  division  has approved the employment report,
  emergency contracts, and contracts with  contractors  or  subcontractors
  for which the division has previously approved an employment report.
    7.  The  time  schedules  for actions required to be taken pursuant to
  this section shall be defined by rule of the procurement policy board in
  accordance with the provisions of section three hundred eleven.
    f. Periodic  review.  The  commissioner  may  require  contractors  or
  subcontractors  to file periodic employment reports after the award of a
  contract in such form and with such frequency as  the  commissioner  may

  corporation, the public development corporation, school boards, and  the
  city housing authority, shall:

  employment opportunity requirements of contracts under its  jurisdiction
  and  refer  and  recommend  matters  to  the  division  with  respect to
  non-compliance with the provisions of this section;

    2. designate a deputy  commissioner  or  other  executive  officer  to

    h.  Enforcement, remedies and sanctions. Upon receiving a complaint or
  at its own instance, the commissioner may conduct such investigation  as
  may be necessary to determine whether contractors and subcontractors are
  in  compliance  with  the  equal  employment opportunity requirements of
  federal, state and local laws and executive orders. If the  commissioner
  has  reason  to  believe  that  a  contractor or subcontractor is not in
  compliance with the provisions of this section, the  commissioner  shall
  seek  the  contractor's or subcontractor's agreement to adopt and adhere
  to  an  employment  program  designed   to   ensure   equal   employment
  opportunity,  including  but  not limited to measures designed to remedy
  underutilization  of  minorities  and  women  in  the  contractor's   or
  subcontractor's  workforce,  and  may,  in  addition,  recommend  to the
  contracting agency that payments to the contractor be suspended  pending
  a  determination  of the contractor's or subcontractor's compliance with
  such requirements. If the contractor or subcontractor does not agree  to
  adopt  or does not adhere to such a program, the commissioner shall make
  a determination as to whether the  contractor  or  subcontractor  is  in
  compliance  with  the  provisions  of this section, and shall notify the
  head of the contracting agency of such determination and any  sanctions,
  including  withholding  of payment, imposition of an employment program,
  or other sanction or remedy provided by law or by  contract,  which  the
  executive   director  believes  should  be  imposed.  The  head  of  the
  contracting agency shall impose such sanction unless he or she  notifies
  the commissioner in writing that the agency head does not agree with the
  recommendation,  in  which  case  the  commissioner  and the head of the
  contracting agency shall jointly determine any sanction to  be  imposed.
  If  the agency head and the commissioner do not agree on the sanction to
  be imposed, the matter  shall  be  referred  to  the  mayor,  who  shall
  determine any sanction to be imposed.
    i. Confidentiality. To the extent permitted by law and consistent with
  the  proper  discharge  of  the  division's  responsibilities under this
  section all information provided by a contractor to the  division  shall
  be confidential.

    1. to contracts for financial or other assistance between the city and
  a government or governmental agency;
    2.  to  contracts,  resolutions, indentures, declarations of trust, or
  other  instruments  authorizing  or  relating  to   the   authorization,
  issuance,  award, and sale of bonds, certificates of indebtedness, notes
  or other fiscal obligations of the city, or consisting  thereof,  except
  as otherwise provided by law or executive order; or
    3.  to  employment  by the city of its officers and employees which is
  subject to equal employment opportunity requirements of applicable law.
