  lower lip is low over the appliance(s) and is "set back" from the  front
  of  the  appliance(s). It is always closed to the rear of the appliances
  by a panel where free-standing,  or  by  a  panel  or  wall  where  wall
  mounted, and its height above the cooking surface varies. (This style of
  hood  can  be  constructed  with  partial  end  panels  to  increase its
  effectiveness  in  capturing  the  effluent  generated  by  the  cooking
  operation).
    Double  Island Canopy Hood. A double island canopy hood is placed over
  back to back appliances or appliance lines. It is open on all sides  and
  overhangs both fronts and the sides of the appliance(s). It could have a
  wall  panel  between the backs of the appliances. (The fact that exhaust
  air is drawn from both sides of the double canopy to meet in the  center
  causes each side of this hood to emulate a wall canopy hood, and thus it
  functions must the same with or without an actual wall panel between the
  backs of the appliances).
    Eyebrow  Hood.  An  eyebrow hood is mounted directly to the face of an
  appliance, such as an oven  and  dishwasher,  above  the  opening(s)  or

  a single appliance or appliance line.  It  is  open  on  all  sides  and
  overhangs  the  front,  rear,  and  sides  of the appliance(s). A single

  island canopy is more susceptible to cross drafts and requires a greater
  exhaust air flow than an equivalent sized wall-mounted canopy to capture
  and contain effluent generated by the cooking operation(s).
    Wall Canopy Hood. A wall canopy exhaust hood is mounted against a wall
  above  a  single  appliance  or  line  of  appliance(s),  or it could be
  free-standing with a back panel from the rear of the appliances  to  the
  hood.  It  overhangs the front and sides of the appliance(s) on all open
  sides. The wall acts as a back panel, forcing the makeup air to be drawn
  across  the  front  of  the  cooking  equipment,  thus  increasing   the
  effectiveness  of  the  hood to capture ad contain effluent generated by
  the cooking operation(s).

                             NATURAL VENTILATION
  402.1  General.  Natural  ventilation  of an occupied space shall comply
  with Chapter 12 of the New York City Building Code.
    402.2 Reserved.
    402.3 Reserved.

    402.4 Reserved.
                               SECTION MC 403
                           MECHANICAL VENTILATION
  403.1  Ventilation system. Mechanical ventilation shall be provided by a
  method of supply air and return or exhaust air. The amount of supply air
  shall be approximately equal to the amount of return  and  exhaust  air.
  The  system  shall not be prohibited from producing negative or positive
  pressure. The system to convey ventilation air  shall  be  designed  and
  installed in accordance with Chapter 6.
    Ventilation  supply  systems shall be designed to deliver the required
  rate of supply air to the occupied zone within an  occupied  space.  The
  occupied  zone shall have boundaries measured at 3 inches (76 mm) and 72
  inches (1829 mm) above the  floor  and  24  inches  (610  mm)  from  the
  enclosing walls.
    403.2  Outdoor  air required. The minimum ventilation rate of required
  outdoor air shall be determined in accordance with Section 403.3.
    403.2.1 Recirculation of air. The air required by Section 403.3  shall
  not  be  recirculated.  Air  in excess of that required by Section 403.3
  shall not be prohibited from being recirculated as a component of supply
  air to building spaces. except that:
    1. Ventilation air shall not be recirculated from one dwelling unit to
  another or to dissimilar occupancies.
    2. Supply air to a swimming pool and associated deck areas  shall  not
  be recirculated unless such air is dehumidified to maintain the relative
  humidity of the area at 60 percent or less. Air from this area shall not
  be recirculated to other spaces.
    3.  Where mechanical exhaust is required by Table 403.3, recirculation
  of air from such spaces shall be prohibited. All air  supplied  to  such
  spaces  shall be exhausted, including any air in excess of that required
  by Table 403.3.
    403.2.2 Transfer air. Except where recirculation from such  spaces  is
  prohibited  by  Table 403.3, air transferred from occupied spaces is not
  prohibited from serving, as makeup air for required exhaust  systems  in
  such  spaces  as  kitchens,  baths,  toilet rooms, elevators and smoking
  lounges. The amount of transfer air and exhaust air shall be  sufficient
  to  provide  the  flow rates as specified in Sections 403.3 and 403.3.1.
  The required outdoor  air  rates  specified  in  Table  403.3  shall  be
  introduced  directly  into  such spaces or into the occupied spaces from
  which air is transferred or a combination of both.
    403.3 Ventilation rate. Ventilation systems shall be designed to  have
  the  capacity  to  supply the minimum outdoor airflow rate determined in
  accordance with Table 403.3 based on the occupancy of the space and  the
  occupant  load  or  other parameter as stated therein. The occupant load
  utilized for design of the ventilation system shall not be less than the
  number  determined  from  the  estimated  maximum  occupant  load   rate
  indicated   in  Table  403.3.  Ventilation  rates  for  occupancies  not
  represented  in  Table  403.3  shall  be  determined  by   an   approved
  engineering analysis. The ventilation system shall be designed to supply
  the  required rate of ventilation air continuously during the period the
  building is occupied, except as otherwise stated in other provisions  of
  the code.
    Exception:  The  occupant load is not required to be determined, based
  on the estimated maximum occupant load rate indicated  in  Table  403.3,
  where  approved  statistical  data document the accuracy of an alternate
  anticipated occupant density.

  systems.   These   documents   shall   be  accompanied  with  sufficient
  information  and  analysis  to   demonstrate   compliance   with   these
  provisions.
    513.3  Special  inspection  and  test requirements. In addition to the
  ordinary inspection and test requirements  which  buildings,  structures
  and parts thereof are required to undergo, smoke control systems subject
  to  the  provisions  of  Section  909 of the New York City Building Code
  shall undergo special inspections and tests  sufficient  to  verify  the
  proper  commissioning of the smoke control design in its final installed
  condition. The design submission accompanying the construction documents
  shall clearly detail procedures and methods to be  used  and  the  items
  subject  to  such  inspections and tests. Such commissioning shall be in

  accordance with  generally  accepted  engineering  practice  and,  where
  possible,  based  on  published  standards  for  the  particular testing
  involved. The special inspections and tests  required  by  this  section
  shall  be conducted under the same terms as found in Section 1704 of the
  New York City Building Code.
    513.4 Analysis. A rational analysis  supporting  the  types  of  smoke
  control  systems to be employed, their methods of operation, the systems
  supporting them, and the methods of construction to  be  utilized  shall
  accompany  the  submitted  construction documents and shall include, but
  not be limited to, the  items  indicated  in  Sections  513.4.1  through
  513.4.6.
    513.4.1  Stack  effect.  The  system  shall  be designed such that the
  maximum probable normal or reverse  stack  effects  will  not  adversely
  interfere  with  the  system's  capabilities. In determining the maximum
  probable  stack  effects,  altitude,  elevation,  weather  history   and
  interior temperatures shall be used.
    513.4.2  Temperature  effect of fire. Buoyancy and expansion caused by
  the design fire in accordance with Section 513.9 shall be analyzed.  The
  system  shall  be  designed  such  that  these  effects do not adversely
  interfere with its capabilities.
    513.4.3 Wind effect. The design shall consider the adverse effects  of
  wind.  Such  consideration  shall  be  consisted  with  the wind-loading
  provisions of the New York City Building Code.
    513.4.4 HVAC systems. The design shall consider  the  effects  of  the
  heating,  ventilating  and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems on both smoke
  and fire transport. The  analysis  shall  include  all  permutations  of
  system's  status.  The  design shall consider the effects of fire on the
  HVAC systems.
    513.4.5  Climate.  The  design  shall  consider  the  effects  of  low
  temperatures on systems, property and occupants. Air inlets and exhausts
  shall be located so as to prevent snow or ice blockage.

  control  system  shall be capable of continued operation after detection
  of the fire event for not less than 20 minutes.
    513.5 Smoke barrier construction. Smoke barriers shall comply with the
  New York City Building Code. Smoke barriers  shall  be  constructed  and
  sealed  to  limit  leakage  areas  exclusive  of protected openings. The
  maximum allowable leakage area shall be the  aggregate  area  calculated
  using the following leakage area ratios:
    1. Walls: A/A[w] = 0.00100
    2. Exit enclosures: A/A[w] = 0.00035
    3. All other shafts: A/A[w] = 0.00150
    4. Floors and roofs: A/A[F} = 0.00050
    where:
    A = Total leakage area, square feet (m{2}).
    A[F}] = Unit floor or roof area of barrier, square feet (m{2}).
    A[w] = Unit wall area of barrier, square feet (m{2}).
    The  leakage  area  ratios shown do not include openings due to doors,
  operable windows or similar gaps. These shall be included in calculating
  the total leakage area.
    513.5.1 Leakage area. Total leakage area of the barrier is the product
  of the smoke barrier gross area times the allowable leakage area  ratio,
  plus  the area of such as gaps and operable windows. Compliance shall be
  determined by achieving the minimum air pressure difference  across  the
  barrier  with  the system in the smoke control mode for mechanical smoke
  control systems.  Passive  smoke  control  systems  tested  using  other
  approved  means  such  as  door  fan testing shall be as approved by the
  commissioner.

  installed  having  vision  panels  with  approved   fire-rated   glazing
  materials  in  approved  fire-rated  frames, the area of which shall not
  exceed that tested. The doors shall be close-fitting within  operational
  tolerances,  and shall not have undercuts, louvers or grilles. The doors
  shall have head and jamb stops, astragals or rabbets  at  meeting  edges
  and   automatic-closing  devices.  Positive  latching  devices  are  not
  required.
    4. Group I-3.
    5. Openings between smoke zones with clear ceiling heights of 14  feet
  (4267  mm)  or greater and bank down capacity of greater than 20 minutes
  as determined by the design fire size.
    513.5.2.1 Ducts and air transfer  openings.  Ducts  and  air  transfer
  openings  are  required  to  be protected with a minimum Class II, 250°F
  (121°C) smoke damper complying with the New York City Building Code.
    513.6  Pressurization  method.  The  primary   mechanical   means   of
  controlling   smoke  shall  be  by  pressure  differences  across  smoke
  barriers.  Maintenance of a tenable environment is not required  in  the
  smoke control zone of fire origin.
    513.6.1  Minimum  pressure difference. The minimum pressure difference
  across a smoke barrier shall be 0.05-inch water Gage (12.4 Pa) in  fully
  sprinklered buildings.
    In  buildings  permitted to be other than fully sprinklered, the smoke
  control system shall be designed  to  achieve  pressure  differences  at
  least  two  times the maximum calculated pressure difference produced by
  the design fire.
    513.6.2  Maximum  pressure  difference.  The  maximum   air   pressure
  difference  across  a  smoke  barrier  shall  be  determined by required
  door-opening or closing forces. The actual force required to  open  exit
  doors  when  the  system  is  in  the  smoke  control  mode  shall be in
  accordance with the New York City Building  Code.  Opening  and  closing
  forces  for  other  doors  shall  be  determined by standard engineering
  methods for the resolution of forces and reactions. The calculated force
  to set a side-hinged, swinging door in motion shall be determined by:
 
    F = F[dc]+K(WA/\P)/2(W-d)                     (Equation 5-2)
    where:
    A = Door area, square feet (m{2}).
    d = Distance from door handle to latch edge of door, feet (m).
    F = total door opening force, pounds (N).

    513.7 Airflow design method. When approved by the commissioner,  smoke
  migration  through  openings fixed in a permanently open position, which
  are located between smoke control  zones  by  the  use  of  the  airflow
  method,  shall  be permitted. The design airflows shall be in accordance
  with  this  section. Air-flow shall be directed to limit smoke migration
  from the fire zone. The geometry of  openings  shall  be  considered  to
  prevent flow reversal from turbulent effects.
    513.7.1 Velocity. The minimum average velocity through a fixed opening
  shall not be less than:
 
    v = 217.2 [h(T[f]-T[o])/T[f]+460)]{1/2}              (Equation 5-3)
    For SI: v = 119.9 [h(T[f]-T[o])/T[f]]{1/2}
    where:
    H = Height of opening, feet (m).
    T[f] = Temperature of smoke, °F (K).
    T[o] = Temperature of ambient air, °F (K).
    v = Air velocity, feet per minute (m/minute).
 
    513.7.2 Prohibited conditions. This method shall not be employed where
  either the quantity of air or the velocity of the airflow will adversely
  affect  other portions of the smoke control system, unduly intensify the
  dire, disrupt plume dynamics or interfere with exiting. In no case shall
  airflow toward the fire exceed 200 feet per minute (1.02 m/s). Where the
  formula in Section 513.7.1 requires airflow to exceed  this  limit,  the
  airflow method shall not be used.
    513.8  Exhaust  method.  When approved by the commissioner, mechanical
  smoke control for large enclosed volumes, such as  in  atria  or  malls,
  shall  be  permitted  to  utilize the exhaust method. The design exhaust
  volumes shall be in accordance with this section.

  the  accumulating smoke layer shall be maintained at least 10 feet (3048
  mm) above any walking surface which forms a portion of a required egress
  system within the smoke zone. The required exhaust  rate  for  the  zone
  shall  be  the  largest  of the calculated plume mass flow rates for the
  possible plume configurations. Provisions shall be made for  natural  or
  mechanical supply of outside air from outside or adjacent smoke zones to
  make  up  for  the air exhausted. Makeup airflow rates, when measured at
  the potential fire location, shall not exceed 200 feet per minute  (1.02
  m/s)  toward  the  fire. The temperature of the makeup air shall be such
  that it does not expose  temperature-sensitive  fire-protection  systems
  beyond their limits.
    513.8.2  Axisymmetric  plumes.  The  plume  mass  flow rate (m[p]), in
  pounds per second (kg/s), shall be determined by placing the design fire
  center on the axis of the  space  being  analyzed.  The  limiting  flame
  height shall be determined by:
 
    z[l] = 0.533Q[c]{2/5}                               (Equation 5-4)

    z[l] = Limiting flame height, feet (m). The z[l] value must be greater
           than the fuel equivalent diameter (see Section 513.9).
    for z > z[l]
    m[p] = 0.022Q[c]{1/3}[z]{5/3}+0.0042Q[c]

    For SI: m[p] = 0.071Q[c]{1/3}z{5/3}+0.0018Q[c]
    for z = z[l]
    M[p} = 0.011 Q[c]
    For SI: m[p] = 0.035Q[c]
    for z l]
    M[p] = 0.0208Q[c]{3/5}z
    For SI: m[p] = 0.032Q[c]{3/5}z
      To convert m[p] from pounds per seccond of mass flow to a volumetric
      rate, the following formula shall be used:
    V = 60m[p]/p                                      (Equation 5-5)
    where:

  spill plumes shall be determined using the geometrically probable  width
  based  on  architectural  elements  and  projections  in  the  following
  formula:
 
    M[p] = 0.124(QW{2}){1/3}(z[b]+0.25H)                (Equation 5-6)
    For SI: m]p] = 0.36(QW[2}){1/3}(z[b]+0.25H)
    where:
    H = Height above fire to underside of balcony, feet (m).
    M[p] = Plume mass flow rate, pounds pwer second (kg/s).
    Q = Total heat output.
    W = Plume width at point of spill, feet (m).
 
    513.8.4 Window plumes. The  plume  mass  flow  rate  (m[p])  shall  be
  determined from:
 
  m[p] = 0.077(A[w]H[w]{1/2})[1/3(z[w]+a){5/3}+0.18A[w]H[w]{1/2}
                                                        (Equation 5-7)
    For SI: m[p] = 0.68(A[w]H[w]}1/2})(z[w]+a){5/3}+1.5A[w]H[w]{1/2}

    H[w] = Height of the opening, feet (m).
    M[p] = Plume mass flow rate, pounds per second (kg/s).
    Z[w]  =  Height from the top of the window or opening to the bottom of
  the smoke layer, feet (m).
    a = 2.4A[w]{2/5}H[w]1/5-2.1H[w]
 
  513.8.5 Plume contact with walls. When a plume contacts one or  more  of
  the  surrounding  walls,  the  mass  flow rate shall be adjusted for the
  reduced entrainment resulting from the contact provided that the contact
  remains constant. Use of this  provision  requires  calculation  of  the
  plume diameter, that shall be calculated by:
 
    d = 0.48 [(T[c]+460)/(T[a]+460)]{1/2}z              (Equation 5-8)

    where:
    d = Plume diameter, feet (m).
    T[a] = Ambient air temperature, °F (°K).
    T[c] = Plume centerline temperature, °F (°K)
         = 0.6 (T[a]+460)Q[c]{2/3}Z{-5/3}+T[a]
    z = Height at which T[c] is determined, feet (m).
    For SI: T[c] = 0.08 T[a]Q[c]{2/3}Z{-5/3}+T[a]

    1103.2 Occupancy classification. Locations  of  refrigerating  systems
  are  described by occupancy classifications that consider the ability of
  people  to  respond  to  potential  exposure  to  refrigerants.    Where
  equipment  or  appliances,  other  than  piping,  are  located outside a
  building  and  within  20  feet  (6096 mm) of any building opening, such
  equipment  or  appliances   shall   be   governed   by   the   occupancy
  classification  of  the  building.  Occupancy  classifications  shall be
  defined as follows:
    1. Institutional occupancy is that portion  of  premises  from  which,
  because  they  are  disabled,  debilitated or confined, occupants cannot
  readily  leave  without  the   assistance   of   others.   Institutional
  occupancies include, among others, hospitals, nursing homes, asylums and
  spaces containing locked cells.
    2.  Public  assembly occupancy is that portion of premises where large
  numbers of people congregate and from  which  occupants  cannot  quickly
  vacate  the  space.  Public  assembly occupancies include, among others,
  auditoriums, ballrooms, classrooms, passenger  depots,  restaurants  and
  theaters.
    3. Residential occupancy is that portion of premises that provides the
  occupants   with   complete  independent  living  facilities,  including
  permanent  provisions  for  living,  sleeping,   eating,   cooking   and
  sanitation. Residential occupancies include, among others,  dormitories,
  hotels, multi-unit apartments and private residences.
    4.  Commercial  occupancy  is  that  portion  of premises where people
  transact business, receive personal service or purchase food  and  other
  goods.    Commercial  occupancies  include,    among  others, office and
  professional buildings, markets (but not large  mercantile  occupancies)
  and work or storage areas that do not qualify as industrial occupancies.
    5.  Large  mercantile occupancy is that portion of premises where more
  than 100 persons congregate on levels above or  below  street  level  to
  purchase personal merchandise.
    6.  Industrial  occupancy is that portion of premises that is not open
  to the public, where access by authorized  persons  is  controlled,  and
  that  is  used to manufacture, process or store goods such as chemicals,
  food, ice, meat or petroleum.
    7. Mixed occupancy occurs when two or  more  occupancies  are  located
  within  the same building. When each occupancy is isolated from the rest
  of the building by tight walls, floors and ceilings and by  self-closing
  doors, the requirements for each occupancy shall apply to its portion of
  the  building.  When  the  various  occupancies are not so isolated, the
  occupancy having the most stringent requirements shall be the  governing
  occupancy.
    1103.3   System   classification.   Refrigeration   systems  shall  be
  classified according to  the  degree  of  probability  that  refrigerant
  leaked  from  a  failed  connection,  seal,  or component could enter an
  occupied area. The distinction is based on the basic design or  location
  of the components.
    1103.3.1  Low-probability systems. Double-indirect open-spray systems,
  indirect closed systems and indirect  vented  closed  systems  shall  be
  classified    as    low-probability    systems,    provided   that   all
  refrigerant-containing  piping  and  fittings  are  isolated  when   the
  quantities in Table 1103.1 are exceeded.
    1103.3.2   High-probability   systems.  Direct  systems  and  indirect
  open-spray systems shall be classified as high-probability systems.
    Exception: An indirect open-spray system shall not be required  to  be
  classified as a high-probability system if the pressure of the secondary
  coolant  is  at  all  times  (operating  and  standby)  greater than the
  pressure of the refrigerant.

                               SECTION MC 1104
                       SYSTEM APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS

  exhaust combustion products to the outdoors.
    Exception: A hood and exhaust system shall not be required:
    1. Where the refrigerant is R-717, R-718, or R-744;
    2. Where the combustion air is ducted from the outdoors  in  a  manner
  that prevents leaked refrigerant from being combusted; or
    3.  Where  refrigerant  detector is used to stop the combustion in the
  event of a refrigerant leak (see Sections 1105.3 and 1105.5)
    1104.4 Volume calculations. Volume calculations shall be in accordance
  with Sections 1104.4.1 through 1104.4.3.
    1104.4.1 Noncommunicating  spaces.  Where  the  refrigerant-containing
  parts  of  a  system  are  located  on  one  or  more spaces that do not
  communicate through permanent openings or HVAC ducts, the volume of  the
  smallest,  enclosed  occupied  space  shall  be  used  to  determine the
  permissible quantity of refrigerant in the system.
    1104.4.2 Communicating spaces. Where an  evaporator  or  condenser  is
  located  in  an  air  duct  system, the volume of the smallest, enclosed
  occupied space  served by the duct system shall be used to determine the
  maximum allowable quantity of refrigerant in the system.
    Exception: If airflow to any enclosed space cannot  be  reduced  below
