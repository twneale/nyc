<pre>
    
 
    &sect;28-216.9 Return of precept and reimbursement of city. Upon compliance
  with  any  precept issued to the commissioner in a proceeding under this
  article, the commissioner may make return thereof, with  an  endorsement
  of the action thereunder and the costs and expenses thereby incurred, to
  the  justice  of  the court from which such precept issued. Such justice
  shall then tax and adjust the amount endorsed  upon  such  precept,  and
  shall  adjust  and allow the disbursements of the proceeding, including,
  but not limited to the preliminary expenses of searches, service of  the
  notice of survey and summons on interested parties, surveys thereof, and
  costs  of executing the precept, which shall be inserted in the judgment
  in such proceeding. Such justice shall then  render  judgment  for  such
  amount  and  for the sale of the premises named in such notice, together
  with all the right, title and interest that the  person  named  in  such
  notice  had  in  the  lot,  ground or land upon which such structure was
  placed, at the time of the filing  of  a  notice  of  pendency  in  such
  proceedings, or at the time of the entry of judgment therein, to satisfy
  such judgment in foreclosure of mortgages. Nothing in this article shall
  preclude  the  city from recovering such costs and expenses in any other
  lawful manner, including pursuant to section 28-112.9 of this code.
