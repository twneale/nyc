    &sect;28-211.1.1  Rebuttable presumption. In any proceeding that relates to
  a false statement in a certification of correction of a violation  filed
  in  compliance  with  section  28-204.2 if an inspection made within six
  months  after  the  filing  of  the  certification  finds  a   condition
  constituting  a violation that is the same as the condition described in
  the notice of violation with respect to  which  such  certification  was
  filed,  there  shall  be  a  rebuttable  presumption  that the condition
  described in  such  notice  of  violation  continued  and  is  the  same
  condition found in the inspection.
