    &sect;28-207.5  Cease  use  orders  for  service  equipment.  Whenever  the
  commissioner determines that the operation of any service  equipment  is
  or  may  be  dangerous  to  life, health or safety, the commissioner may
  issue a cease use order requiring such equipment  to  be  shut  down  or
  sealed  or  otherwise made inoperable. Upon the issuance of such order a
  tag or notice shall be affixed to the device warning that the  equipment
  is  unsafe for operation. It shall be unlawful to operate such equipment
  or to remove or deface such tag unless and until the cease use order  is
  rescinded by the commissioner.
