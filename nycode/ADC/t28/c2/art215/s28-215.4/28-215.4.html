  commissioner  shall  notify  the  owner of the structure affected of any
  failure to comply with any of the provisions of this code  that  concern
  the  protection  of  the  public  and  workers  during  construction  or
  demolition. Unless the owner so notified proceeds immediately to  comply
  with  the  orders  of the commissioner, the commissioner shall have full
  power to correct the violation. All expenses  incurred  therefore  shall
  become a lien on the property pursuant to section 28-112.9.
