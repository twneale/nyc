    &sect;28-201.2   Classification   of  violations.  The  commissioner  shall
  promulgate rules classifying all violations of  this  code,  the  zoning
  resolution or, with regard to existing buildings, the 1968 building code
  or  other  laws  or  rules  enforced  by  the  department as immediately
  hazardous violations, major violations or lesser violations  unless  the
  classification of such violations is specifically directed by this code.
  Such  classification  shall  be  based on the effect of the violation on
  life, health, safety  or  the  public  interest  or  the  necessity  for
  economic disincentive.
