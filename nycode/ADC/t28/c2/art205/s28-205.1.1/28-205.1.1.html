<pre>
    
 
    &sect;28-205.1.1  Corporation  counsel. Such actions and proceedings may be
  instituted by the corporation counsel in the name of  the  city  in  any
  court  of  competent  jurisdiction  in  the  city  and  shall  be  given
  preference over pending causes therein. In such actions or  proceedings,
  the  city  may  apply for restraining orders, preliminary injunctions or
  other provisional remedies, with or without notice; and no  undertakings
  shall  be required as a condition to the granting or issuing of any such
  order, injunction or remedy, or by reason thereof. No court  shall  lose
  jurisdiction  of  any action or proceeding hereunder by reason of a plea
  that the title to real estate is involved if the object of the action is
  to recover a penalty for the violation of any of the provisions of  this
  code.
