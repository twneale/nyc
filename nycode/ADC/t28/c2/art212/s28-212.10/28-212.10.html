<pre>
    
 
    &sect;28-212.10  Rescission  of  order of closure. If at any time after the
  issuance of such order, the owner, mortgagee, or other person having  an
  interest  in  the property provides assurance, in a form satisfactory to
  the commissioner, that the illegal commercial or  manufacturing  use  of
  the  premises has been discontinued and will not reoccur, or such owner,
  mortgagee, or other person establishes that the premises may be lawfully
  occupied for such use, the commissioner shall rescind the closure order.
  If such order is rescinded, the commissioner shall, upon request of such
  owner, mortgagee, or other person, provide a copy  of  such  rescission,
  which  may  be  filed with the county clerk or register of the county in
  which such premises are located. No such re-occupancy shall be permitted
  without a certificate of occupancy authorizing such use.
