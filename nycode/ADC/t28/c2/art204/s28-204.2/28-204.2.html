Section 28-204.2

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;28-204.2  Order  to certify correction. Each such notice of violation
  shall contain an order of the commissioner directing the  respondent  to
  correct  the  condition  constituting the violation and to file with the
  department electronically or in such other manner as the department  may
  authorize by rule a certification that the condition has been corrected.
  Unless  otherwise  provided  by  rule,  such  order  shall  require that
  violations classified as major or lesser be  corrected  within  30  days
  from  the  date  of the order, that violations classified as immediately
  hazardous be corrected forthwith. Such order  shall  also  require  that
  certification of the correction of the violation shall be filed with the
  department  in a manner and form and within such period of time as shall
  be  established  by  the  department.  In  any  proceeding  before   the
  environmental  control  board,  no  civil penalty shall be imposed for a
  lesser violation if the  respondent  complies  with  the  commissioner's
  order  to  correct and to certify correction of the violation within the
  applicable time period. However, such violation may serve as a predicate
  for purposes of assessing aggravating factors attributable  to  multiple
  offenses.
