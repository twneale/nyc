Section 28-204.6.2

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;28-204.6.2  Lien.  All  such unpaid judgments shall constitute a lien
  upon the property named in the violation  with  respect  to  which  such
  judgment  was  rendered  when  the  amount  shall  have  been definitely
  computed as a statement of account by the department, and the department
  shall file such statement with  the  department  of  finance  for  entry
  against  the  property.  Such  lien shall have a priority over all other
  liens and encumbrances except for the lien  of  taxes  and  assessments.
  However,  no  lien  created  pursuant  to this section 28-204.6 shall be
  enforced against a subsequent purchaser in good faith  or  mortgagee  in
  good faith unless the requirements of section 28-204.6.1 are satisfied.
