  order to seal, secure and close. Notwithstanding any other law, rule, or
  regulation, any person, corporation,  partnership,  association  or  any
  other  legal  entity who permits a building, structure, enclosure, place
  or premises, or any part thereof, to be unlawfully occupied or  used  in
  contravention  of an order of the commissioner pursuant to this article,
  or who negligently fails to prevent or prohibit such unlawful  occupancy
  or use, shall be liable for a civil penalty of not more than one million
  dollars, if any other person suffers serious physical injury, as defined
  in  section  ten  of the penal law, or death in the building, structure,
  place or premises or any party thereof subject to such order as a result
  of such unlawful occupancy or use.  If  more  than  one  person  suffers
  serious  physical injury or death, such penalty shall be recoverable for
  each person suffering serious physical injury  or  death.  Such  penalty
  shall  be recovered in a civil action brought by the corporation counsel
  in the name of the city in  any  court  of  competent  jurisdiction.  In
  determining  the  amount  of  the  civil penalty to be imposed the court
  shall consider:
    1. The extent and severity of injury to persons and property caused by
  the violation;
    2. The history of violations by the defendant at such premises, or any
  other premises, of laws or rules enforced by the department;
    3. The degree of willfulness, recklessness, or negligence displayed by
  the defendant in committing the subject violation;
    4. The defendant's financial resources; and
    5. The defendant's good faith efforts to cure the  subject  violation,
  including  efforts  to  obtain entry to or possession of the premises in
  order to do so.
