Section 28-401.10

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;28-401.10  Issuance  of license, plate and/or seal, where applicable,
  or certificate of competence. The commissioner shall issue a license  or
  certificate  of  competence  to  each applicant who shall have submitted
  satisfactory evidence of his  or  her  qualifications,  and  shall  have
  satisfactorily  passed  all  required  examinations  and investigations,
  provided that no license or certificate of competence  shall  be  issued
  unless  and  until  the  applicant  shall have paid the required fee and
  complied with such other and further  requirements  for  the  particular
  license or certificate of competence as may be set forth in this chapter
  and in rules promulgated by the department. All licenses or certificates
  of competence issued by the commissioner shall have his or her signature
  affixed  thereto;  but the commissioner may authorize any subordinate to
  affix such signature. For licenses  that  require  a  plate  and/or  the
  application  of  a  seal, the plate and/or seal shall be issued with the
  license except as provided otherwise in this chapter. The license, plate
  and seal are the property of the department and are not transferable  by
  the licensee. No licensee shall make or cause to be made duplicates of a
  department-issued  license,  plate  or  seal.  The  loss  or  theft of a
  license, plate or seal must be reported to the  department  within  five
  calendar days.
