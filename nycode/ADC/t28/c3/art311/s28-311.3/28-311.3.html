Section 28-311.3

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 28-311.3 Sub-meters required for covered tenant spaces. On and after
  January 1, 2025, the electrical consumption of each covered tenant space
  shall  be  measured  by  one  or  more  sub-meters.  Sub-meters shall be
  installed in existing covered tenant spaces by the owner or  the  lessor
  of  such  space  on  or  prior  to January 1, 2025 and thereafter as new
  covered tenant spaces are created within the building.  If  the  covered
  tenant  space  is  a floor with multiple tenancies, each tenancy that is
  10,000 gross square feet (929 m{2}) or less shall (i)  have  a  separate
  sub-meter, (ii) share a sub-meter with other tenant spaces on the floor,
  or (iii) share a sub-meter covering the entire floor.
    Exception:  Covered  tenant space for which the electrical consumption
  within such space is measured by a meter dedicated exclusively  to  that
  space.
