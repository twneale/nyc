Section 28-305.1.1

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;28-305.1.1  Structures located on the lot line of adjacent properties
  and partially on both properties.  The  owners  of  adjacent  properties
  shall  be  responsible  jointly for the proper maintenance and repair of
  retaining walls, partition fences and other site structures, or portions
  thereof, that are located along the common lot line and  on  both  their
  properties; and each such owner shall be responsible for one-half of the
  costs  of  maintaining  and  repairing  such fences, retaining walls and
  other site structures, or such portions thereof. Where an  owner  elects
  to  remove  temporarily  a  retaining  wall  or  partition fence that is
  required to support a grade differential between the two properties,  or
  for  any other reason is required by this code, such owner shall protect
  the adjacent property, shall not impair its safe use, and shall  replace
  the retaining wall or partition fence at his or her own cost.
