Section 28-305.1.2

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;28-305.1.2  Structures  located  entirely on one property. Where such
  retaining walls, partition fences or other site structures, or  portions
  thereof,  are  located  entirely  on  one  property,  the  owner of such
  property shall be wholly responsible  for  the  proper  maintenance  and
  repair  of  the retaining wall, partition fence or other site structure.
  If, however, the proper maintenance  and/or  repair  of  such  retaining
  wall,  partition  fence  or other site structures requires access to the
  adjoining property, the owner of such  adjoining  property  shall  allow
  such access.
