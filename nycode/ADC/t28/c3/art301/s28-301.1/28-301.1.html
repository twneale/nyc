  thereof  and  all  other  structures  shall  be  maintained  in  a  safe
  condition.  All  service equipment, means of egress, materials, devices,
  and safeguards that are required in a building by the provisions of this
  code, the 1968 building code or other applicable laws or rules, or  that
  were  required  by  law  when  the  building  was  erected,  altered, or
  repaired, shall  be  maintained  in  good  working  condition.  Whenever
  persons  engaged  in  building  operations have reason to believe in the
  course of such operations  that  any  building  or  other  structure  is
  dangerous  or  unsafe, such person shall forthwith report such belief in
  writing to the department. The owner shall be responsible at  all  times
  to  maintain  the  building  and its facilities and all other structures
