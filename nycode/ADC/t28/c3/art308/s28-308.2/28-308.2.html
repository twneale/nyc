Section 28-308.2

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  28-308.2  Energy  audits  required.  The owner shall ensure that an
  energy audit is performed on the base  building  systems  of  a  covered
  building prior to filing an energy efficiency report as required by this
  article.    Except  as otherwise provided in section 28-308.7, an energy
  audit shall be performed by  or  under  the  supervision  of  an  energy
  auditor  and  shall be performed in accordance with rules promulgated by
  the department. The audit process shall cover the base building  systems
  and shall identify at a minimum:
    1.  All  reasonable  measures,  including  capital  improvements, that
  would, if implemented, reduce energy use and/or the  cost  of  operating
  the building;
    2. For each measure, the associated annual energy savings, the cost to
  implement,  and the simple payback, calculated by a method determined by
  the department;
    3. The building's  benchmarking  output  consistent  with  the  United
  States  Environmental  Protection Administration (EPA) Portfolio Manager
  tool or as otherwise established by the department;
    4. A break-down of energy usage by system and predicted energy savings
  by system after implementation of the proposed measures; and
    5. A general assessment of how the major  energy  consuming  equipment
  and  systems  used within tenant spaces impact the energy consumption of
  the base building systems based on a representative sample of spaces.
    Exceptions:
    1. No energy audit is required if the building complies  with  one  of
  the following as certified by a registered design professional:
    1.1. The covered building has received an EPA Energy Star label for at
  least  two  of  the  three  years preceding the filing of the building's
  energy efficiency report.
    1.2. There is no EPA Energy Star rating for the building  type  and  a
  registered  design  professional  submits documentation, as specified in
  the rules of the department, that the building's energy  performance  is
  25  or more points better than the performance of an average building of
  its type over a two-year period within the three-year  period  prior  to
  the   filing   of  an  energy  efficiency  report  consistent  with  the
  methodology of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design  (LEED)
  2009 rating system for Existing Buildings published by the United States
  Green Building Council (USGBC) or other rating system or methodology for
  existing buildings, as determined by the department.
    1.3.  The  covered  building has received certification under the LEED
  2009 rating system for Existing Buildings  published  by  the  USGBC  or
  other  rating  system  for  existing  buildings,  as  determined  by the
  department, within four years prior to  the  filing  of  the  building's
  energy efficiency report.
    2.  An  energy  audit  shall  not  be  required  for  the first energy
  efficiency report of a simple building that is in  compliance  with  six
  out  of seven of the following items as certified by a registered design
  professional:
    2.1. Individual heating  controls.  (i)  Each  dwelling  unit  in  the
  building  has  one  or  more  thermostatic  controls controlling all the
  heating units within the the dwelling unit  and  any  heated  space  not
  within a dwelling unit has one or more thermostatic controls controlling
  all  the  heating  units  within  the  space, or (ii) the building has a
  central heating system controlled by an energy management  system  or  a
  building management system that incorporates temperature sensors located
  in  at  least  10  percent  of  the dwelling units and 10 percent of the
  heated spaces, except that the total number of sensors  required  within
  the building shall not be less than 10 nor more than 30.

    2.2.  Common area and exterior lighting. Common area (lighting outside
  of tenant spaces) and exterior lighting, at a minimum, are in compliance
  with the provisions of the New York city energy conservation code as  in
  effect for new systems installed on or after July 1, 2010.
    2.3.  Low  flow  faucets and shower heads. All faucets and showerheads
  within the building, at a minimum, meet the standards of table 604.4  of
  the  New  York city plumbing code as in effect for new systems installed
  on or after July 1, 2010.
    2.4. Pipe insulation. All exposed pipes that are used to  convey  heat
  or  hot  water  are  insulated,  at  a  minimum,  in accordance with the
  standards of the New York city energy conservation code as in effect for
  new systems installed on or after July 1, 2010.
    2.5. Domestic hot water. All domestic hot water tanks that do not have
  built-in insulation are insulated with a  minimum  insulation  value  of
  R-8.
    2.6.  Washing  machines.  All common area clothes washing machines are
  front loading.
    2.7. Cool roof. The roof complies with section 1504.8 of the New  York
  city  building  code  as  in  effect for new buildings constructed on or
  after July 1, 2010.
