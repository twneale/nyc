Section 28-308.4

<pre>
    
 
  &sect;  28-308.4  Energy  efficiency  report  required.  Except  as otherwise
  provided in section 28-308.7, the owner of a covered building shall file
  an energy efficiency report for such building between January first  and
  December  thirty-first  of the calendar year in which such report is due
  pursuant  to  this  section  and  between  January  first  and  December
  thirty-first of every tenth calendar year thereafter.
    Exceptions:
    1.  An  owner  may  apply  for  an extension of time to file an energy
  efficiency report if despite such owner's  good  faith  efforts,  to  be
  documented  in  such  application,  the  owner is unable to complete the
  required energy audit and retro-commissioning prior to the scheduled due
  date for such report. The commissioner may grant no more than  two  such
  extensions of no more than one year each. Extensions granted pursuant to
  this  provision  shall not extend the scheduled due dates for subsequent
  energy efficiency reports.
    2. An owner may receive annual extensions of time to  file  an  energy
  efficiency report based on financial hardship of the building.
