  control of the heating equipment using interior temperature sensors.
    CITY  BUILDING.  A  covered building that is owned by the city and for
  which the city regularly pays all or part of the annual energy bills.

  m{2}),  (ii)  two  or  more  buildings on the same tax lot that together
  exceed 100,000 gross square feet (9290  m{2}),  or  (iii)  two  or  more
  buildings held in the condominium form of ownership that are governed by

  classified  as  class one pursuant to subdivision one of section 1802 of
  the real property tax law of the state of New York.

  and  requirements for a building, including temperature and humidity set
  points, operating hours, filtration,  and  any  integrated  requirements

  developing modifications and improvements of the base building  systems,
  including  but  not  limited  to  alterations  of  such  systems and the
  installation of new equipment, insulation or other generally  recognized
  energy  efficiency  technologies  to  optimize energy performance of the
  building and achieve energy savings, provided that  such  process  shall
  not  be  less  stringent than the Level II Energy Survey and Engineering
  Analysis of the 2004  edition  of  Procedures  for  Commercial  Building
  Energy   Audits   published   by   the   American  Society  of  Heating,
  Refrigerating and Air-conditioning Engineers Inc. (ASHRAE).
