Section 28-308.3

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  28-308.3  Retro-commissioning required. The owner shall ensure that
  retro-commissioning is performed on  the  base  building  systems  of  a
  covered building prior to filing an energy efficiency report as required
  by  this  article.  Except  as  otherwise  provided in section 28-308.7,
  retro-commissioning shall be performed by or under this supervision of a
  retro-commissioning agent in accordance with rules  promulgated  by  the
  department.  Such  rules,  at  a  minimum,  shall ensure that sufficient
  analysis, corrections and testing  have  been  done  so  that  the  base
  building  systems  meet  the  following criteria demonstrating efficient
  operation:
    1. Operating protocols, calibration, and sequencing:
    1.1. HVAC  temperature  and  humidity  set  points  and  setbacks  are
  appropriate  and  operating  schedules  reflect  major  space  occupancy
  patterns and the current facility requirements.
    1.2. HVAC sensors are properly calibrated.
    1.3.  HVAC  controls  are  functioning  and  control   sequences   are
  appropriate for the current facility requirements.
    1.4.  Loads  are distributed equally across equipment when appropriate
  (i.e. fans, boilers, pumps, etc. that run in parallel).
    1.5. Ventilation  rates  are  appropriate  for  the  current  facility
  requirements.
    1.6.  System  automatic reset functions are functioning appropriately,
  if applicable.
    1.7. Adjustments  have  been  made  to  compensate  for  oversized  or
  undersized  equipment  so  that  it  is  functioning  as  efficiently as
  possible.
    1.8. Simultaneous heating and cooling does not occur unless intended.
    1.9. HVAC system economizer  controls  are  properly  functioning,  if
  applicable.
    1.10.  The  HVAC  distribution  systems,  both air and water side, are
  balanced.
    1.11. Light levels are appropriate to the task.
    1.12. Lighting sensors and controls are functioning properly according
  to occupancy, schedule, and/or available daylight, where applicable.
    1.13. Domestic hot water systems have been checked  to  ensure  proper
  temperature settings.
    1.14. Water pumps are functioning as designed.
    1.15. System water leaks have been identified and repaired.
    2. Cleaning and repair:
    2.1.  HVAC  equipment (vents, ducts, coils, valves, soot bin, etc.) is
  clean.
    2.2. Filters are clean and protocols  are  in  place  to  replace,  as
  appropriate.
    2.3. Light fixtures are clean.
    2.4.  Motors,  fans,  and  pumps,  including components such as belts,
  pulleys, and bearings, are in good operating condition.
    2.5. Steam traps have been replaced as required to maintain  efficient
  operation, if applicable.
    2.6. Manual overrides on existing equipment have been remediated.
    2.7. Boilers have been tuned for optimal efficiency, if applicable.
    2.8. Exposed hot and chilled water and steam pipes three (3) inches or
  greater  in  diameter  with  associated  control valves are insulated in
  accordance with the standards of the New York city  energy  conservation
  code as in effect for new systems installed on or after July 1, 2010.
    2.9.   In  all  easily  accessible  locations,  sealants  and  weather
  stripping are installed where appropriate and are in good condition.
    3. Training and documentation:

    3.1. Permits for all HVAC, electrical and plumbing  equipment  are  in
  order.
    3.2.   Critical   operations   and  maintenance  staff  have  received
  appropriate training, which may include  labor/management  training,  on
  all   major  equipment  and  systems  and  general  energy  conservation
  techniques.
    3.3. Operational and maintenance record keeping procedures (log books,
  computer maintenance records, etc.) have been implemented.
    3.4. The following documentation is on  site  and  accessible  to  the
  operators:  the  operations and maintenance manuals, if such manuals are
  still available from the manufacturer, the  maintenance  contracts,  and
  the most recent retro-commissioning report.
    Exception:  No retro-commissioning is required if the covered building
  has received  certification  under  the  LEED  2009  rating  system  for
  Existing  Buildings  published  by  the USGBC or other rating system for
  existing buildings, as determined by the department,  within  two  years
  prior  to  the  filing  of  the  building's energy efficiency report and
  earned the LEED point for Existing Building Commissioning  investigation
  and  analysis  and  the  LEED  point for Existing Building Commissioning
  implementation.
