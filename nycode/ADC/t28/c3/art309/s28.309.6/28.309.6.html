  planning and sustainability may suspend all or part of  the  requirement
  to  benchmark  pursuant  to  this  article upon a written finding that a
  technological deficiency in the benchmarking tool  precludes  compliance
  with  this article. The director of the office of long-term planning and
  sustainability may lift all or  part  of  any  such  suspension  upon  a
  written  finding  that such deficiency has been corrected. The office of
  long-term planning and sustainability shall notify the  speaker  of  the
  city  council, the department, the department of citywide administrative
  services, the department of environmental protection and the  department
  of  finance  promptly  upon issuing a suspension or lifting a suspension
  pursuant to this section.
