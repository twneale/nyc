Section 28-309.8

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;   28-309.8   Disclosure.   The  department  of  finance  shall  make
  information generated by the benchmarking tool available to  the  public
  on the internet no later than September 1, 2011, and no later than every
  September  first  thereafter for city buildings, no later than September
  1, 2012, and no later than every September first thereafter for  covered
  buildings  whose  primary  use  is not residential, as determined by the
  department of finance, and no later than September 1, 2013, and no later
  than every  September  first  thereafter  for  covered  buildings  whose
  primary  use is residential, as determined by the department of finance.
  Such information shall include, but need not  be  limited  to:  (i)  the
  energy  utilization  index,  (ii)  the  water use per gross square foot,
  (iii) where available, a rating that compares the energy and  water  use
  of  the  building to that of similar buildings, and (iv) a comparison of
  data across calendar years for any years such building was  benchmarked.
  Information  generated  by  the  benchmarking tool for the 2009 calendar
  year for  city  buildings,  for  the  2010  calendar  year  for  covered
  buildings,  and  for  the 2011 calendar year for covered buildings whose
  primary use is residential, as determined by the department of  finance,
  shall not be disclosed.
    Exception:  Ratings  generated  by the benchmarking tool for a covered
  building that contains a data center, television studio, and/or  trading
  floor  that  together  exceed ten percent of the gross square footage of
  any such building shall not be disclosed until the office  of  long-term
  planning  and  sustainability  determines that the benchmarking tool can
  make adequate adjustments  for  such  facilities.  When  the  office  of
  long-term  planning  and sustainability determines that the benchmarking
  tool can make such adjustments, it shall report  such  determination  to
  the  mayor and the speaker of the city council. Until such determination
  is made, the office  of  long-term  planning  and  sustainability  shall
  report  biennially to the mayor and the speaker of the city council that
  the benchmarking tool is unable to make such adjustments.
