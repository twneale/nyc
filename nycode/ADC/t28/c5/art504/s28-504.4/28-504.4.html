Section 28-504.4

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 28-504.4 Exceptions. Bicycle access need not be provided pursuant to
  this article if an owner, lessee, manager or other person who controls a
  building applies to the commissioner of transportation for an exception,
  on  a  form provided by the department of transportation and sent to the
  department  of  transportation  by  certified   mail,   return   receipt
  requested,  within  fifteen  days  of receipt of a request for a bicycle
  access plan, and certifies that either:
    1. The building's freight  elevator  is  not  available  for  the  use
  described  in  this article because unique circumstances exist involving
  substantial safety risks directly related to the use of  such  elevator.
  Such  application  shall  include  the  reasons  for  such assertion and
  supporting documentation.
    or
    2.  There  is  sufficient  secure  alternate  covered  off-street   or
  sufficient  secure alternate indoor no-cost bicycle parking available on
  the premises or  within  three  blocks  or  seven  hundred  fifty  feet,
  whichever  is  less,  of  such  building  to  accommodate all tenants or
  subtenants of such building requesting bicycle access. Such  application
  shall  include  supporting  documentation  for such assertion, including
  proof that such alternate off-street or indoor parking is  available  to
  or  under the control of such owner, lessee, manager or other person who
  controls the building.
  If an exception is sought for the reasons set forth in  subdivision  one
  of  this  section,  the  department  shall  conduct an inspection of the
  building and  freight  elevator  and  shall  thereafter  issue  a  final
  determination  as  to  whether to grant an exception. If an exception is
  sought for the reasons set forth in subdivision two of this section, the
  department, in consultation with the department of transportation, shall
  thereafter  conduct  an  inspection  of  the  secure  alternate  covered
  off-street  or  secure indoor no-cost bicycle parking and the department
  of transportation shall thereafter issue a  final  determination  as  to
  whether to grant an exception. In either event, a letter of exception or
  denial shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the
  owner,  lessee,  manager, or other person in control of the building. If
  the exception is denied, a bicycle access plan shall  be  posted  within
  twenty  days  of receipt of such determination. Failure to timely post a
  bicycle access plan shall be cause for the issuance of a violation.
