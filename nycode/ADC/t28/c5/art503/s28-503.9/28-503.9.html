    &sect;28-503.9  Storage and disposal. The commissioner shall adopt rules to
  provide for the storage and disposal  of  any  sign  or  sign  structure
  removed  pursuant  to  this  article. If the identity and address of the
  owner of such  property  is  reasonably  ascertainable,  notice  of  the
  removal  shall  be  sent to the owner within a reasonable period of time
  after the removal. If such property is not claimed  within  thirty  days
  after its removal, it shall be deemed to be abandoned and may be sold at
  a public auction after having been advertised in the City Record and the
  proceeds  paid  into  the general fund or if the commissioner determines
  that the property is not saleable, he or she may turn over such property
  to the department of sanitation for disposal. Property removed  pursuant
  to  this article shall be released to the owner or other person lawfully
  entitled to possession upon payment of the costs of removal and  storage
  as  set  forth  in  the  rules  of the department and any fines or civil
  penalties imposed for the violation or, if an action or  proceeding  for
  the  violation  is  pending in court or before the environmental control
  board, upon the posting of a bond or other form of  security  acceptable
  to  the  department  in  an amount which will secure the payment of such
  costs and any fines or civil penalties which  may  be  imposed  for  the
  violation.
