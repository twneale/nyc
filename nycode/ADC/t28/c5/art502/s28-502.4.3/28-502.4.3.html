Section 28-502.4.3

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;28-502.4.3  Certification  of list. Such list shall be accompanied by
  (i) a  certification  by  an  architect  or  engineer,  co-signed  by  a
  responsible  officer  of the outdoor advertising company, that all signs
  reported on such list are in compliance with the zoning resolution; (ii)
  copies of proof that the sign complies with the zoning resolution and  a
  certification  by  the  sign's owner that to the best of the certifier's
  knowledge and belief the information provided is accurate,  or  (iii)  a
  written  opinion  by  the department, stating that the sign to which the
  opinion refers complies with the zoning resolution. Notwithstanding  any
  inconsistent  provision  of  this  code,  where,  in accordance with the
  department's rules, the department renders an opinion, determination  or
  decision  relating  to  whether a sign is nonconforming or whether it is
  located in proximity to an arterial highway as  defined  by  the  zoning
  resolution,  such  decision, determination or opinion will be appealable
  to the board of standards and appeals in accordance with applicable law.
  If a timely appeal to such board is  taken,  the  department  shall  not
  issue  a  notice  of  violation  with  respect  to  such  sign pending a
  determination of such appeal by such board.
