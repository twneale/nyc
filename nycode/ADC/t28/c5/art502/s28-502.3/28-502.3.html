    &sect;28-502.3 Revocation or suspension or registration. The department may
  revoke,  suspend  or  refuse  to  renew  the  registration of an outdoor
  advertising company or impose fines  or  other  penalties  where  it  is
  determined  by  the commissioner, after notice and the opportunity to be
  heard, that (i) such company has made statements that it knew or  should
  have  known are false in any application or certification filed with the
  department, (ii) such company has failed to comply with section 28-502.3
  of this code or the rules adopted pursuant to its provisions by  failing
  to file a listing of signs, sign structures and sign locations under its
  control  as  specified in such section within the time and in the manner
  required by department rules or  by  filing  an  incomplete  listing  of
  signs, sign structures and sign locations under its control as specified
  in  such  section,  (iii)  such company has been found liable for or has
  admitted to violations of the zoning resolution under  section  28-502.5
  of  this  code  committed  on  three or more occasions within a 36 month
  period, where such  violations  relate  to  the  erection,  maintenance,
  attachment,  affixing, painting or representation in any other manner on
  a building or premises of advertising signs, as defined in section 12-10
  of the zoning  resolution,  at  locations  where  the  display  of  such
  advertising  signs  is  not  permitted under the zoning resolution or at
  locations where the display of such advertising signs violates the size,
  height, or illumination provisions of the zoning  resolution,  and  such
  signs are located within a distance of nine hundred linear feet from and
  within view of an arterial highway or within 200 linear feet (60 960 mm)
  from  and  within view of a public park with an area of one half acre or
  more, (iv) such company has failed to pay any civil penalties imposed or
  amounts owed to the city pursuant to section 28-502.5 of this  code  or,
  (v)  such  company  has  violated  the  department's rules pertaining to
  outdoor advertising companies. No application  for  registration  by  an
  outdoor  advertising  company or any affiliate thereof shall be accepted
  for filing by the department for a period of five years after revocation
  of or the refusal to renew the registration of such outdoor  advertising
  company  pursuant  to  this  code.  The  department  shall not accept or
  process any applications for permits to install, erect  or  alter  signs
  pursuant  to  this  code  or  for  the  maintenance of signs pursuant to
  section 28-501.1 of this code where such applications are  filed  by  or
  where such signs are under the control of an outdoor advertising company
  or  any  affiliate  thereof  after  the  registration  of  such  outdoor
  advertising company has been revoked or not renewed or during  the  term
  of  any  period of suspension of such registration. The commissioner may
  settle any proceeding in which the revocation, suspension or renewal  of
  an  outdoor  advertising  company's  registration  is at issue upon such
  terms and conditions as he or she may deem appropriate including but not
  limited to the agreement of an outdoor  advertising  company  to  remove
  signs  along  with  supporting  sign  structures  as a condition for the
  dismissal of such proceeding.
