  safety of existing buildings. Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of
  this  code,  where the alteration of any existing building in accordance
  with a provision of this code would result in a reduction  of  the  fire
  safety or structural safety of such building, relevant provisions of the

  compliance with those provisions of this code  that  would  mitigate  or
  offset such reduction of fire protection or structural safety.
