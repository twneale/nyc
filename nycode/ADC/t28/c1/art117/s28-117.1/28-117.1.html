  commissioner shall provide. The department shall inspect every place  of
  assembly  space prior to the issuance of a certificate of operation. The

  approved construction documents and to the provisions of this  code  and
  that  the certificate of occupancy authorizes such use. A certificate of
  operation shall not be issued to a place of assembly  providing  seating

  other  moveable  furnishings  shall  be  maintained  at all times during
  occupancy in accordance with the approved plan. Any  amendment  of  such
  plan shall be subject to the prior approval of the commissioner.
