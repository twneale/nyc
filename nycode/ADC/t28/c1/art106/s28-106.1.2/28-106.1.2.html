    &sect; 28-106.1.2 Alteration permit for the removal of one or more stories.
  The commissioner shall not issue an alteration permit for the removal of
  one  or  more  stories  of  a  building unless the owner of the building
  provides certification in a form and manner to be provided in the  rules
  of the department of environmental protection that (i) the stories to be
  removed  are  free of asbestos containing material and that no abatement
  activities will be performed anywhere in the building concurrently  with
  the  removal  work authorized by such permit or (ii) the commissioner of
  environmental protection has issued a variance from  these  requirements
  in   accordance   with  subdivision  (o)  of  section  24-146.1  of  the
  administrative code and the rules of  the  department  of  environmental
  protection,  subject  to  the  requirement  that  work authorized by the
  alteration permit will be performed only in parts of the  building  that
  are  certified  free  of  asbestos  containing  material. The alteration
  permit shall be subject to such additional conditions as the  department
  of  buildings  may  require  of  the  permittee  based  on  the size and
  complexity of the work.
    Exception: This section 28-106.1.2 shall not apply to removal  of  one
  or  more  stories performed as emergency work pursuant to article 215 of
  chapter  2  of  this  title  where  the  emergency  warrants   immediate
  commencement of the work.
