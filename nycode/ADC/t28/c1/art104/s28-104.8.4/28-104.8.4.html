    &sect;28-104.8.4   Tenant   protection  plan.  Construction  documents  for
  alterations of buildings in which any dwelling  unit  will  be  occupied
  during  construction  shall  include a tenant protection plan. Such plan
  shall contain a statement that the building contains dwelling units that
  will be occupied during construction and shall  indicate  in  sufficient
  detail   the   specific  units  that  are  or  may  be  occupied  during
  construction, the means and methods to  be  employed  to  safeguard  the
  safety and health of the occupants, including, where applicable, details
  such  as  temporary  fire-rated assemblies, opening protectives, or dust
  containment procedures. The elements of the tenant protection  plan  may
  vary  depending  on  the  nature  and scope of the work but at a minimum
  shall make detailed and specific provisions for:
    1. Egress. At all times in the course of construction provision  shall
  be  made  for  adequate  egress  as required by this code and the tenant
  protection plan  shall  identify  the  egress  that  will  be  provided.
  Required  egress  shall  not  be  obstructed  at  any  time except where
  approved by the commissioner.
    2. Fire safety. All necessary laws and controls, including those  with
  respect  to  occupied  dwellings,  as well as additional safety measures
  necessitated by the construction shall be strictly observed.
    3. Health requirements.  Specification  of  methods  to  be  used  for
  control  of  dust,  disposal  of  construction  debris, pest control and
  maintenance  of  sanitary  facilities,  and  limitation  of   noise   to
  acceptable levels shall be included.
     3.1.   There  shall  be  included  a  statement  of  compliance  with
  applicable provisions of law relating to lead and asbestos.
    4. Compliance with housing standards. The requirements of the New York
  city housing maintenance code, and, where applicable, the New York state
  multiple dwelling law shall be strictly observed.
    5. Structural safety. No  structural  work  shall  be  done  that  may
  endanger the occupants.
    6.  Noise restrictions. Where hours of the day or the days of the week
  in which construction work may be undertaken are limited pursuant to the
  New York city noise control code, such limitations shall be stated.
