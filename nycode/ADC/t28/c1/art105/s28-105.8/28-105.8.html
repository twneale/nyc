    &sect;28-105.8  Validity  of  permit.  The issuance or granting of a permit
  shall not be construed to be a  permit  for,  or  an  approval  of,  any
  violation  of  any of the provisions of this code or of any other law or
  rule. Permits presuming to give  authority  to  violate  or  cancel  the
  provisions  of  this  code  or other law or rule shall not be valid. The
  issuance of a permit based on  construction  documents  and  other  data
  shall  not  prevent  the  commissioner  from requiring the correction of
  errors in the construction documents and other data. The commissioner is
  authorized to prevent any occupancy, use or work in  violation  of  this
  code,  the  zoning  resolution  or  other  law  or  rule enforced by the
  department.
