    &sect;  28-112.10  Waiver  of  application,  permit and inspection fees for
  certain work arising out of the storm that occurred on  October  29  and
  30,  2012. The commissioner shall waive the fees that would otherwise be
  required to be paid by this code, the electrical code or  the  rules  of
  the  department  for  applications,  permits and inspections for certain
  work arising out of the storm that occurred on October 29 and  30,  2012
  as provided in subsections 28-112.10.1 and 28-112.10.2.
    &sect;  28-112.10.1  Eligible  buildings. For the purposes of this article,
  eligible buildings are those buildings that,  following  the  storm  and
  pursuant to an inspection program established by the department under an
  emergency  order  of  the  Mayor, are designated by the department after
  inspection through a notation on the department's records and/or by  the
  posting  of  a  red  placard  warning  on  the  building  or premises as
  seriously damaged and unsafe to enter or occupy or completely demolished
  and/or washed away. With respect to eligible buildings, fees  associated
  with   applications,   permits  and  inspections  shall  be  waived  for
  alteration work, demolition work,  construction  of  new  buildings  and
  associated  work, including but not limited to associated electrical and
  plumbing work. The commissioner may  request  the  applicant  to  submit
  additional  information  relating  to  the  damage.  Waiver of such fees
  pursuant to this section shall be applicable for jobs where the  initial
  application  for  construction  document approval or, if no construction
  documents are required, application for permit is submitted on or  after
  October 30, 2012 and on or before October 31, 2014.
    &sect; 28-112.10.2 Storm related damage to electrical and plumbing systems.
  In  buildings  other  than eligible buildings, fees shall be waived only
  for applications, permits and inspections for work related  to  plumbing
  and  electrical  systems  damaged  by such storm. Applicants must submit
  certification by a licensed master  electrician  or  a  licensed  master
  plumber  or fire suppression piping contractor that the proposed work is
  related to such storm damage. The commissioner may request the applicant
  to submit additional information relating to the damage. Waiver of  such
  fees  pursuant  to  this  section shall be applicable for jobs where the
  initial  application  for  construction  document  approval  or,  if  no
  construction documents are required, application for permit is submitted
  on or after October 30, 2012 and on or before December 31, 2013.
