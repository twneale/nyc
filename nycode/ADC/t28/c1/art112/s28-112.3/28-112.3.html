Section 28-112.3

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;28-112.3  Building permit valuations. Where applicable, the applicant
  for a permit shall provide an estimated job construction cost at time of
  application. Cost estimates shall include total value of work, including
  materials and labor, for which the  permit  is  being  issued,  such  as
  installation  or  alteration  of  building,  gas,  mechanical,  plumbing
  equipment and permanent systems. If, in the opinion of  the  department,
  the  valuation is underestimated on the application, the permit shall be
  denied, unless the applicant can show detailed  estimates  to  meet  the
  approval of the department. Final building permit valuation shall be set
  by the department.
