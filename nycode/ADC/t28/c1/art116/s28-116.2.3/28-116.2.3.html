Section 28-116.2.3

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 28-116.2.3 Special inspections and other inspections required during
  the  progress  of  work.  After  the  issuance of a work permit, special
  inspections and other inspections required  by  this  code  to  be  made
  during  the  progress of the work shall be made at such times or at such
  stages of the work and in such manner as shall be provided by this  code
  or  as  otherwise  required  by the commissioner. The permit application
  shall set forth an inspection program for the job. Such inspections  may
  be  made  by  approved agencies or by the department as provided in this
  code or in the rules of the department.  Special  inspections  shall  be
  performed  only  by  individuals  who are special inspectors. The permit
  holder shall notify the relevant special inspectors in writing at  least
  72  hours  prior  to  the  commencement  of  any  work requiring special
  inspection. The commissioner may accept inspection and test reports from
  approved agencies and  special  inspectors  and  the  work  may,  unless
  otherwise  specifically  provided  by code provisions or directed by the
  commissioner, proceed without any verifying inspection or  test  by  the
  department.  The  names and business addresses of special inspectors and
  approved agencies shall be set forth in the work permit application. All
  inspection reports shall be in writing  and  signed  by  the  person  or
  entity  performing  the inspection. A record of all inspections shall be
  kept by the person  performing  the  inspection.  The  commissioner  may
  require  inspection  reports to be filed with the department. Records of
  inspections made by approved agencies and special  inspectors  shall  be
  maintained  by  such persons for a period of six years after sign-off of
  the job or for such other period of time as the commissioner may require
  and shall be made available to the department upon request.
