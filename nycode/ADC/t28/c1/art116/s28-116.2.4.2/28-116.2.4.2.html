Section 28-116.2.4.2

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;28-116.2.4.2  Final  inspection prior to letter of completion. In all
  cases where the permitted work  does  not  require  the  issuance  of  a
  certificate of occupancy, the final inspection shall be performed by the
  department or at the option of the owner by an approved agency. Whenever
  the  department performs a final inspection, the department shall charge
  a fee for such inspection. The applicant shall take all  reasonable  and
  necessary  steps to insure that the final inspection is performed within
  one year after the expiration of the last permit. The  inspection  shall
  be  performed  after  all  work  authorized  by  the  building permit is
  completed. The person performing the inspection shall note all  failures
  to  comply  with  the  provisions  of this code or approved construction
  documents and shall promptly notify the owner in  writing.  All  defects
  noted in such inspection shall be corrected. The final inspection report
  shall  confirm  that defects noted have been corrected, that the work is
  in substantial compliance with the approved construction  documents  and
  with this code and other applicable laws and rules and that all required
  inspections were performed. Final inspection reports shall be filed with
  and  maintained  by the department. Records of final inspections made by
  approved agencies shall be maintained by such persons for  a  period  of
  six  years  after  sign-off or for such other period as the commissioner
  shall require and  shall  be  made  available  to  the  department  upon
  request.
