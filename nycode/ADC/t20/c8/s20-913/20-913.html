Section 20-913

<pre>
    
 
    20-913 Right to sick time; accrual. a. All employees have the right to
  sick time pursuant to this chapter.
    1.  All  employers  that  employ  fifteen  or  more  employees and all
  employers of one or more domestic workers shall provide paid  sick  time
  to their employees in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and
  the  schedule set forth in section 7 of the local law which enacted this
  section.
    2. All employees not entitled to  paid  sick  time  pursuant  to  this
  chapter  shall  be  entitled  to unpaid sick time in accordance with the
  provisions of this chapter and the schedule set forth in  section  7  of
  the local law which enacted this section.
    3.  All  employers  that employ fifteen to nineteen employees, and all
  employers of one or more domestic workers,  shall  provide  unpaid  sick
  time  in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and the schedule
  set forth in section 7 of the  local  law  which  enacted  this  section
  during  any  period  in  which,  pursuant  to  the schedule set forth in
  section 7 of the local law which enacted this  section,  such  employers
  are  not  required  to  provide paid sick time but employers that employ
  twenty or more employees are required to provide paid sick time.
    b. All employers shall provide a minimum of one hour of sick time  for
  every  thirty  hours worked by an employee, other than a domestic worker
  who shall accrue sick time pursuant to paragraph 2 of subdivision  d  of
  this  section.  Employers  shall  not  be required under this chapter to
  provide more than forty hours of sick time for an employee in a calendar
  year. For purposes of this subdivision, any paid days of rest to which a
  domestic worker is entitled pursuant to section 161(1) of the labor  law
  shall  count  toward  such forty hours. Nothing in this chapter shall be
  construed to discourage  or  prohibit  an  employer  from  allowing  the
  accrual  of sick time at a faster rate or use of sick time at an earlier
  date than this chapter requires.
    c. An employer required to provide paid sick  time  pursuant  to  this
  chapter who provides an employee with an amount of paid leave, including
  paid  time  off,  paid vacation, paid personal days or paid days of rest
  required to be compensated pursuant to section 161(1) of the labor  law,
  sufficient  to meet the requirements of this section and who allows such
  paid leave to  be  used  for  the  same  purposes  and  under  the  same
  conditions  as  sick  time  required  pursuant  to  this chapter, is not
  required to provide additional paid sick time for such employee  whether
  or not such employee chooses to use such leave for the purposes included
  in subdivision a of section 20-914 of this chapter. An employer required
  to  provide  unpaid  sick  time pursuant to this chapter who provides an
  employee with an amount of unpaid or paid  leave,  including  unpaid  or
  paid time off, unpaid or paid vacation, or unpaid or paid personal days,
  sufficient  to meet the requirements of this section and who allows such
  leave to be used for the same purposes and under the same conditions  as
  sick  time required pursuant to this chapter, is not required to provide
  additional unpaid sick time  for  such  employee  whether  or  not  such
  employee  chooses  to  use  such  leave  for  the  purposes set forth in
  subdivision a of section 20-914 of this chapter.
    d. 1. For an employee other than  a  domestic  worker,  sick  time  as
  provided  pursuant  to  this  chapter  shall  begin  to  accrue  at  the
  commencement of employment or on the effective date of this  local  law,
  whichever  is  later,  and  an employee shall be entitled to begin using
  sick  time  on  the  one  hundred  twentieth  calendar   day   following
  commencement  of  his  or her employment or on the one hundred twentieth
  calendar day following the effective date of this local  law,  whichever
  is  later. After the one hundred twentieth calendar day of employment or
  after the one hundred twentieth calendar  day  following  the  effective

  date  of  this local law, whichever is later, such employee may use sick
  time as it is accrued.
    2.  In  addition  to  the paid day or days of rest to which a domestic
  worker is entitled pursuant to section 161(1) of  the  labor  law,  such
  domestic  worker shall also be entitled to two days of paid sick time as
  of the date that such domestic worker is entitled to such  paid  day  or
  days  of rest and annually thereafter, provided that notwithstanding any
  provision of this chapter to the contrary, such two days  of  paid  sick
  time  shall  be calculated in the same manner as the paid day or days of
  rest are calculated pursuant to the provisions of section 161(1) of  the
  labor law.
    e.  Employees  who are not covered by the overtime requirements of New
  York state law or regulations, including the wage orders promulgated  by
  the New York commissioner of labor pursuant to article 19 or 19-A of the
  labor  law,  shall  be assumed to work forty hours in each work week for
  purposes of sick time accrual unless their regular  work  week  is  less
  than  forty  hours,  in  which  case  sick  time accrues based upon that
  regular work week.
    f. The provisions of this chapter do  not  apply  to  (i)  work  study
  programs  under  42  U.S.C.  section  2753, (ii) employees for the hours
  worked and compensated by or through qualified scholarships  as  defined
  in  26 U.S.C. section 117, (iii) independent contractors who do not meet
  the definition of employee under section 190(2) of the  labor  law,  and
  (iv) hourly professional employees.
    g.  Employees  shall  determine how much earned sick time they need to
  use, provided that employers may set a reasonable minimum increment  for
  the use of sick time not to exceed four hours per day.
    h.  Except for domestic workers, unused sick time as provided pursuant
  to this chapter shall be carried over to the  following  calendar  year;
  provided that no employer shall be required to (i) allow the use of more
  than  forty  hours  of  sick  time in a calendar year or (ii) carry over
  unused paid sick time if the employee is paid for any unused  sick  time
  at  the  end  of the calendar year in which such time is accrued and the
  employer provides the employee with an amount of  paid  sick  time  that
  meets  or exceeds the requirements of this chapter for such employee for
  the immediately subsequent  calendar  year  on  the  first  day  of  the
  immediately subsequent calendar year.
    i.  Nothing  in this chapter shall be construed as requiring financial
  or other  reimbursement  to  an  employee  from  an  employer  upon  the
  employee's  termination,  resignation,  retirement,  or other separation
  from employment for accrued sick time that has not been used.
    j. If an employee is transferred to a  separate  division,  entity  or
  location  in  the  city  of  New  York, but remains employed by the same
  employer, such employee is entitled to all  sick  time  accrued  at  the
  prior  division, entity or location and is entitled to retain or use all
  sick time as provided pursuant to the provisions of this  chapter.  When
  there is a separation from employment and the employee is rehired within
  six  months  of separation by the same employer, previously accrued sick
  time that was not used shall be reinstated and such  employee  shall  be
  entitled  to  use such accrued sick time at any time after such employee
  is rehired, provided that no employer shall  be  required  to  reinstate
  such  sick  time  to the extent the employee was paid for unused accrued
  sick time prior to separation and the employee agreed to accept such pay
  for such unused sick time.
