Section 20-914

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  20-914  Use  of  sick time. a. An employee shall be entitled to use
  sick time for absence from work due to:
    1. such employee's  mental  or  physical  illness,  injury  or  health
  condition  or  need for medical diagnosis, care or treatment of a mental
  or physical illness, injury or health condition or need  for  preventive
  medical care; or
    2.  care  of  a  family  member  who  needs medical diagnosis, care or
  treatment of a mental or physical illness, injury or health condition or
  who needs preventive medical care; or
    3. closure of such employee's place of business by order of  a  public
  official  due  to  a  public health emergency or such employee's need to
  care for a child whose school or childcare provider has been  closed  by
  order of a public official due to a public health emergency.
    b.  An  employer may require reasonable notice of the need to use sick
  time. Where such need is foreseeable, an employer may require reasonable
  advance notice of the intention to use such sick  time,  not  to  exceed
  seven days prior to the date such sick time is to begin. Where such need
  is  not  foreseeable,  an  employer  may  require an employee to provide
  notice of the need for the use of sick time as soon as practicable.
    c. For an absence  of  more  than  three  consecutive  work  days,  an
  employer  may require reasonable documentation that the use of sick time
  was authorized by subdivision a of this  section.  For  sick  time  used
  pursuant  to  paragraphs  1  and  2  of  subdivision  a of this section,
  documentation signed by a licensed health care provider  indicating  the
  need  for  the  amount of sick time taken shall be considered reasonable
  documentation and an employer shall not require that such  documentation
  specify  the  nature of the employee's or the employee's family member's
  injury, illness or condition, except as required by law.
    d. Nothing herein shall prevent an employer from requiring an employee
  to provide written confirmation that an employee used sick time pursuant
  to this section.
    e. An employer shall not require an employee, as a condition of taking
  sick time, to search for or find a replacement worker to cover the hours
  during which such employee is utilizing sick time.
    f. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit an  employer
  from  taking  disciplinary  action,  up  to  and  including termination,
  against a worker who uses sick time provided pursuant  to  this  chapter
  for purposes other than those described in this section.
