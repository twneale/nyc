    &sect; 20-113 Trade name. A license issued under chapter two shall be valid
  only   for  activities  conducted  under  the  name  of  the  person  or
  organization to whom such license was issued or  under  the  trade  name
  stated  in  the  application  therefor;  if a licensed activity is to be
  conducted under a trade name, the  application  must  state  that  trade
  name.  No  license  shall be issued for more than one trade name, and no
  licensed activity may be carried out under  more  than  one  such  name;
  provided,  however, that if a person or organization was engaged in bona
  fide licensed activities under more than one  such  trade  name  or  was
  issued  a  license  to  conduct  licensed activities under more than one
  trade name prior to June fifth, nineteen hundred seventy-three, a single
  license shall be issued for such trade names. Licensees shall notify the
  commissioner or the commissioner's designee of any change of trade  name
  at  least  ten  days  before  such change becomes effective, and no such
  change may  take  place  without  the  prior  written  approval  of  the
  commissioner or the commissioner's designee.
