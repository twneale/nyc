Section 20-101

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 20-101 Legislative intent. The council finds that for the protection
  and  relief  of  the  public  from  deceptive, unfair and unconscionable
  practices, for the maintenance of standards of  integrity,  honesty  and
  fair  dealing  among  persons  and  organizations  engaging  in licensed
  activities, for the protection of the health and safety of the people of
  New York city and for other purposes requisite to promoting the  general
  welfare,  licensing by the department of consumer affairs is a necessary
  and proper mode of regulation with respect to certain trades, businesses
  and industries. The council finds further that, in order to  secure  the
  above-mentioned  purposes,  and  generally to carry out responsibilities
  for supervising and regulating licensed activities,  trades,  businesses
  and  industries,  the  commissioner of consumer affairs requires powers,
  remedies and sanctions which  are  equitable,  flexible  and  efficient.
  Finally,  the  council finds that sanctions and penalties applied by the
  commissioner and by the courts for the violation of laws and regulations
  by  individuals  and  organizations   engaging   in   various   licensed
  activities,  trades,  businesses  and  industries, must be sufficient to
  achieve these above-mentioned purposes of licensing.
