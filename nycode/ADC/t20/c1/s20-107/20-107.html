Section 20-107

<pre>
    
 
    * &sect; 20-107 Applications; filing fee; license fee. All applications for
  licenses  shall  be  made  to  the  commissioner  or  the commissioner's
  designee in such form and detail  as  shall  be  prescribed.  Except  as
  specifically  provided  in  chapter two, every application shall include
  the license fee for the full license term. If the license is not issued,
  the lesser of fifty dollars or one-half of  the  amount  of  the  annual
  license  fee  shall  be  retained  by the department as a non-returnable
  filing fee. In the event a license is issued  for  less  than  the  full
  license  term,  the applicable fee shall be decreased proportionately to
  the nearest half year, except that in no case shall the fee be less than
  the fee for one-half year. Where a two year license is surrendered for a
  reason other than suspension or revocation and less than one year of the
  license term has expired, the licensee may apply  for  a  refund  of  an
  amount equal to one year's license fee. Except as otherwise specifically
  provided  for  in  chapter  two,  reference to fees, license fees or any
  other word of similar import shall be deemed to be the license  fee  for
  one  year.  Notwithstanding  any inconsistent provision of this section,
  whenever the commissioner increases or decreases the term of a  type  of
  license  pursuant  to  section  20-108 of this chapter, the fee for such
  license shall be increased or decreased proportionately and  the  amount
  of  refund  due  upon surrender of such license before the expiration of
  the term for a reason other  than  suspension  or  revocation  shall  be
  prorated to the unexpired term.
    * NB Effective until April 16, 2014
    * &sect;  20-107 Applications; filing fee; license fee. a. All applications
  for licenses shall be made to the  commissioner  or  the  commissioner's
  designee in such form and detail as shall be prescribed.
    b.  Every  application  for  a  license  or the renewal of an existing
  license shall provide an opportunity for the applicant to  indicate  the
  language  in which he or she would prefer that inspections in connection
  with such license be conducted. Nothing  in  this  subdivision  nor  any
  failure  to  comply  with  such  preference  shall be construed so as to
  create a  cause  of  action  or  constitute  a  defense  in  any  legal,
  administrative, or other proceeding.
    c.  Except  as specifically provided in chapter two, every application
  shall include the license fee for the full license term. If the  license
  is  not issued, the lesser of fifty dollars or one-half of the amount of

  non-returnable  filing  fee.  In  the event a license is issued for less
  than the full license  term,  the  applicable  fee  shall  be  decreased

  and the amount of refund due upon surrender of such license  before  the
  expiration  of the term for a reason other than suspension or revocation
  shall be prorated to the unexpired term.
