Section 20-716

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  20-716  Legislative  findings.  The  council  hereby finds that the
  demand for electricity in the city has been steadily growing;  that  the
  supply of electricity has on frequent occasions been inadequate fully to
  meet  the  demand  therefor;  that the distribution system of the public
  utility company serving most of the city has frequently  been  disrupted
  by  heavy  loads; that major brownouts and blackouts in various sections
  of the city have frequently resulted from such conditions,  particularly
  in  the  summer; that there is no present basis for concluding that such
  conditions will not continue for  the  foreseeable  future;  that  fifty
  percent  of  the  annual  summer growth in demand for electricity in the
  city is due to air conditioning, that forty percent of the  peak  summer
  demand  for electricity in the city is attributable to air conditioning;
  that room air conditioners use a significant  part  of  the  electricity
  used  for  air  conditioning in the city; that the amount of electricity
  used by room air conditioners  of  comparable  cooling  capacity  varies
  widely;  that  most  sellers  of  room air conditioners do not presently
  advertise,  display  or   otherwise   provide   prospective   purchasers
  information  as to the amount or cost of electricity required to operate
  the various models of room air conditioners; that such  information,  if
  provided,  would  lead consumers to purchase more efficient models; that
  the growth in demand for electricity in the city, particularly in summer
  months, would thereby be slowed and there would be  an  amelioration  of
  some  of  the  conditions  which  lead  to  brownouts and blackouts. The
  council also finds that an adequate supply of electricity  is  vital  to
  the  health, safety and welfare of all persons in the city. Accordingly,
  the council further finds that, in order to conserve electricity,  there
  is  a  need  to  provide prospective purchasers of room air conditioners
  with information with respect to the efficiency and cost of operation of
  such units.
