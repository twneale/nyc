  following terms shall have the following meanings:

  services  that the consultant represents will help to achieve any of the

    4.  "Homeowner"  means  a  natural  person  who  is the mortgagor with

    5.  "Unit  of  advertising  space"  means  any  real  property, space,
  facility or instrumentality, or any portion thereof, owned  or  operated
  by  the  city  of  New  York,  or  which  is located or operates on real
  property owned or operated by the city of New York,  and  which  is  the
  subject  of  the  same  contract,  lease,  rental  agreement, franchise,
  revocable consent, concession or other similar  written  agreement  with
  the  city  of  New  York  which  allows  the  placement  or  display  of
  advertisements, but not including any real property, space  or  facility
  leased  from  the  city  of  New York for a term of thirty years or more

  letter or handbill and/or via a unit  or  units  of  advertising  space,
  shall  disclose  in  such  advertising,  in  accordance  with  the rules
  established by the commissioner, in clear and prominent letter type,  in
  a  print  color  that  contrasts  with  the  background against which it
  appears:
    1. that, pursuant to section 265-b of the New York state real property
  law, a distressed property consultant is prohibited from:
    i. performing services without a written, fully executed contract with
  a homeowner;
    ii.  accepting  payment  for  consulting  services  before  the   full
  completion of such services;
    iii. taking power of attorney from a homeowner; and
    iv.  retaining  any  original loan document or other original document
  related to the distressed home loan, the property, or the potential loss
  of the home for nonpayment of taxes.
    2. that hiring a distressed property  consultant  does  not  stop  the
  foreclosure  process, nor can a distressed property consultant guarantee
  any particular result with regards to a distressed property.
    c. The commissioner may make and  promulgate  such  rules  as  may  be
  necessary for the proper implementation and enforcement of this section.

    d.  Any person who is a party to an otherwise valid agreement with the
  city of New York in effect on the date of enactment  of  the  local  law
  that added this section shall not be subject to the requirements of this
  section  for  the  term of such agreement. However, where such agreement
  provides  for  a right or rights of renewal for one or more periods upon
  the same terms and conditions or terms and conditions set forth in  such
  agreement, the holder who is a party to such agreement or any agreements
  entered  into  pursuant  to  such  right  or  rights of renewal shall be
  subject to the requirements of this section at the commencement  of  the
  first renewal period.
    e.  (1)  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision of law, the department
  shall be authorized  upon  due  notice  and  hearing,  to  impose  civil
  penalties  for  the  violation  of  any  provision  of this section. The
  department shall have the power to render decisions and  orders  and  to
  impose  civil  penalties  of  not  less  than  two thousand five hundred
  dollars nor more than five thousand  dollars  for  each  violation.  All
  proceedings  authorized pursuant to this paragraph shall be conducted in
  accordance with rules promulgated by the commissioner. The remedies  and
  penalties  provided  for  in  this paragraph shall be in addition to any
  other remedies  or  penalties  provided  for  the  enforcement  of  such
  provisions  under  any other law including, but not limited to, civil or
  criminal actions or proceedings.
    (2) All such proceedings shall be commenced by the service of a notice
  of  violation  returnable  to  the  administrative   tribunal   of   the
  department.  The  commissioner  shall  prescribe the form and wording of
  notices of violation. The notice of  violation  or  copy  thereof  shall
  constitute  notice  of  the  violation  charged,  and,  if  sworn  to or
  affirmed, shall be prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein.
