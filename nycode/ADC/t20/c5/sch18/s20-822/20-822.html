Section 20-822

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 20-822 Prohibited conduct and violations.
    a.   It   shall   be   unlawful   to  sell  or  offer  for  sale,  any
  over-the-counter medication, later than the date, if  any,  marked  upon
  the  label as indicative of the date beyond which the contents cannot be
  expected to be safe and effective.
    b. Violations. A person violating section 20-822  of  this  subchapter
  shall  be  guilty  of a violation punishable by a fine not to exceed two
  hundred and fifty dollars for the first violation  and  a  fine  not  to
  exceed five hundred dollars for any subsequent violation. In addition to
  such penalties, any person who violates this section shall be liable for
  a  civil  penalty of not less than one hundred dollars nor more than two
  hundred and fifty dollars for the first violation and of not  less  than
  two  hundred  and  fifty  dollars nor more than five hundred dollars for
  each subsequent violation. For purposes of this subdivision, each  group
  of  identical  over-the-counter  medication  subject  to this subchapter
  marked with the same date shall constitute a single violation.  However,
  where  the expired over-the-counter medication is sold to a person, each
  sale shall constitute a separate violation under this section. Penalties
  shall be enforced in accordance with subdivision g of section twenty-two
  hundred and three of the charter of the city of New York.
