Section 20-772

<pre>
    
 
    * &sect; 20-772 Written Agreement. No immigration assistance services shall
  be  provided until the customer has executed a written contract with the
  provider who will provide such services. The  contract  shall  be  in  a
  language understood by the customer, either alone or with the assistance
  of  an  available  interpreter, and, if that language is not English, an
  English language version of the contract must also be provided.  A  copy
  of  the  contract  shall be provided to the customer upon the customer's
  execution of the contract. The customer has  the  right  to  cancel  the
  contract  within  three  business days after his or her execution of the
  contract, without fee or penalty.  The  right  to  cancel  the  contract
  within three days without payment of any fee may be waived when services
  must  be  provided  immediately  to avoid a forfeiture of eligibility or
  other loss of rights or  privileges,  and  the  customer  furnishes  the
  provider  with a separate dated and signed statement, by the customer or
  his or her representative,  describing  the  need  for  services  to  be
  provided  within  three days and expressly acknowledging and waiving the
  right to cancel the contract within three  days.  The  contract  may  be
  cancelled  at  any  time  after  execution. If the contract is cancelled
  after three days, or within three days if the right  to  cancel  without
  fee has been waived, the provider may retain fees for services rendered,
  and  any additional amounts actually expended on behalf of the customer.
  All other amounts must be returned to the customer within  fifteen  days
  after  cancellation. The written contract shall be in plain language, in
  at least twelve point type and shall include the following:
    1. The name, address and telephone number of the provider.
    2. Itemization of all services to be provided to the customer, as well
  as the fees and costs to be charged to the customer.
    3. A statement that original documents required  to  be  submitted  in
  connection with an application made to the federal bureau of citizenship
  and  immigration  services  or  for  other  certifications,  benefits or
  services provided by government may not be retained by the provider  for
  any reason, including payment of fees or costs.
    4.  A  statement  that  the provider shall give the customer a copy of
  each document filed with a governmental entity.
    5. A statement that the customer is not required to obtain  supporting
  documents through the provider, but may obtain such documents himself or
  herself.
    6.  The  statement:  "You  have three (3) business days to cancel this
  contract. Notice of cancellation must be in writing, signed by  you  and
  mailed  by  registered  or  certified  United  States  mail  to (specify
  address). If you cancel this contract within three days,  you  will  get
  back your documents and any fees that you paid."
    7.  A  statement  that the provider has financial surety in effect for
  the benefit of any customer in the event that the  customer  is  owed  a
  refund,  or is damaged by the actions of the provider, together with the
  name, address and telephone number of the surety.
    8. The statement: "The individual providing assistance  to  you  under
  this  contract is not an attorney licensed to practice law or accredited
  by the board of immigration appeals to  provide  representation  to  you
  before   the   bureau  of  citizenship  and  immigration  services,  the
  department  of  labor,  the  department  of  state  or  any  immigration
  authorities  and  may  not  give  legal  advice or accept fees for legal
  advice."
    9. The statement: "The individual providing assistance  to  you  under
  this  contract  is  prohibited from disclosing any information or filing
  any forms or documents with immigration  or  other  authorities  without
  your knowledge and consent."

    10.  The  statement:  "A  copy  of  all  forms completed and documents
  accompanying the forms shall be kept by the service provider  for  three
  years.  A copy of the customer's file shall be provided to the client on
  demand and without fee."
