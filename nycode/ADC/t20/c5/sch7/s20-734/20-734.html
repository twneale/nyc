  any provider of funeral services:
    a. to fail to display the three least expensive  caskets  offered  for
  sale in the same general manner as other caskets are displayed, provided
  that  if  fewer  than  twelve  caskets  are  displayed,  only  the least
  expensive casket must be so displayed; or
    b. to interfere  with  the  customer's  selection  of  merchandise  or
  services offered for sale including: (1) representing in any manner that
  any  funeral merchandise or service is offered for sale when such is not
  a bona fide  offer  to  sell  said  product  or  services,  (2)  falsely
  discouraging  any  purchase  by  disparagement,  by  suggestion that any
  merchandise or service is not readily available or  by  defacement,  (3)
  disparaging  concern  for  price by suggestion that a customer's concern
  for price or  desire  to  save  money  on  merchandise  or  services  is
