Section 20-757

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  20-757  Unsolicited  offers. Offers for goods or services shall not
  appear on any invoice for  a  delayed  payment  transaction  unless  the
  customer  has  previously  agreed  to  receive  such  offers.  Where the
  consumer has so agreed, and the item listed is  an  offer,  the  invoice
  must  state  in  letters of point size equal to that of the amount to be
  charged, "This is an offer." No offers shall be included  in  the  total
  amount due and payable, but must be separately itemized and totalled.
