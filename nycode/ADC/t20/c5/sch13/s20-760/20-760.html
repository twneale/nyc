Section 20-760

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  20-760  Tobacco  product  promotion  restriction.  a.  It  shall be
  unlawful for any person to offer  or  cause  to  be  offered  a  tobacco
  product  promotion,  as defined in section 27-508.2 of this code, to any
  person younger than eighteen years of age.
    b. Any person offering or causing to  be  offered  a  tobacco  product
  promotion  shall verify through a driver's license or other photographic
  identification  card  issued  by  a  government  entity  or  educational
  institution  that  a person to whom a tobacco product promotion has been
  offered is at least eighteen years of age. Such identification need  not
  be  required  of  any  individual  who reasonably appears to be at least
  twenty-five years of age; provided, however, that such appearance  shall
  not  constitute  a  defense in any proceeding alleging the offering of a
  tobacco product promotion to an individual under eighteen years of age.
    c. A  proceeding  to  recover  any  civil  penalty  pursuant  to  this
  subchapter  shall  be  commenced by the service of a notice of violation
  which  shall  be  returnable  to  the  administrative  tribunal  of  the
  department. The administrative tribunal of the department shall have the
  power to impose civil penalties for violation of this subchapter.
    d.  Nothing in this subchapter shall be deemed to prohibit sponsorship
  of or at events as set forth in section 27-508.5 of this code.
