Section 20-818

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 20-818 Penalties. a. Any pregnancy services center that violates the
  provisions  of sections 20-816 or 20-817 of this subchapter or any rules
  or regulations promulgated  thereunder  shall  be  liable  for  a  civil
  penalty  of not less than two hundred dollars nor more than one thousand
  dollars for the first violation and a civil penalty  of  not  less  than
  five hundred dollars nor more than two thousand-five hundred dollars for
  each succeeding violation.
    b.  (1) If any pregnancy services center is found to have violated the
  provisions of section 20-816 on three or more separate occasions  within
  two  years,  then,  in  addition  to imposing the penalties set forth in
  subdivision a of this section, the  commissioner,  after  notice  and  a
  hearing, shall be authorized to order that the pregnancy services center
  be  sealed for a period not to exceed five consecutive days, except that
  such premises may be entered with the  permission  of  the  commissioner
  solely for actions necessary to remedy past violations of section 20-816
  or  prevent  future  violations  or  to  make the premises safe. For the
  purposes of this subdivision, any violations  at  a  pregnancy  services
  center  shall not be included in determining the number of violations of
  any subsequently established pregnancy services center at that  location
  unless the commissioner establishes that the subsequent operator of such
  pregnancy  services  center  acquired the premises or pregnancy services
  center, in whole or in part, for the purpose of permitting the  previous
  operator  of  the pregnancy services center who had been found guilty of
  violating section 20-816 of this subchapter to avoid the effect of  such
  violations.
    (2)  Orders  of  the  commissioner issued pursuant to paragraph one of
  this subdivision shall be posted at the premises that are the subject of
  the order(s).
    (3) Ten days  after  the  posting  of  an  order  issued  pursuant  to
  paragraph one of this subdivision, and upon the written directive of the
  commissioner,  officers  and employees of the department and officers of
  the New York city police department  are  authorized  to  act  upon  and
  enforce such orders.
    (4)  A closing directed by the department pursuant to paragraph one of
  this subdivision shall not constitute an act of possession, ownership or
  control by the city of the closed premises.
    (5) Mutilation or removal of a posted order of the commissioner or his
  designee shall be punishable by a fine of  not  more  than  two  hundred
  fifty  dollars  or  by imprisonment not exceeding fifteen days, or both,
  provided such order contains therein a notice of such penalty. Any other
  intentional disobedience or resistance to any provision  of  the  orders
  issued pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision, including using or
  occupying  or  permitting any other person to use or occupy any premises
  ordered closed without the permission of the department as described  in
  subdivision  b  shall, in addition to any other punishment prescribed by
  law, be punishable by a fine of not more than one thousand  dollars,  or
  by imprisonment not exceeding six months, or both.
    c.  For  the purposes of this section, all violations committed on any
  one day by any one pregnancy services center shall constitute  a  single
  violation.
