<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  20-817  Confidentiality  of health and personal information. a. All
  health information and personal information provided by a client in  the
  course  of  inquiring  about or seeking services at a pregnancy services
  center shall be treated as confidential and not disclosed to  any  other
  individual,  company  or  organization  unless  such client, in writing,
  requests or consents to the release of such information,  or  disclosure
  is required by operation of law or court order.
    b.  Any  consent  for  the  release  of health or personal information
  required pursuant to subdivision a of this section must:
    (1) be in writing, dated and signed by the client;
    (2) identify the nature of the information to be disclosed;
    (3) identify the name and institutional affiliation of the  person  or
  class of persons to whom the information is to be disclosed;
    (4)  identify  the  organization  or  individual  who  is  to make the
  disclosure;
    (5) identify the client;
    (6) contain an expiration date or an expiration event that relates  to
  the client or the purpose of the use or disclosure.
    c.  Any  client  that  consents  to  the release of health or personal
  information pursuant to subdivision b of this section must have a  clear
  and complete understanding of the nature of such release and the content
  of such information.
    d.  Notwithstanding  subdivisions  a  and  b  of  this section, if any
  pregnancy services center employee or volunteer has reasonable cause  to
  suspect  that a client receiving services at a pregnancy services center
  is an abused or maltreated child, such employee or volunteer may  report
  such  abuse  to  the  statewide  central  register  of  child  abuse and
  maltreatment  in  accordance  with  section  four-hundred  thirteen   or
  four-hundred fourteen of the social services law of New York, and to the
  administration  for  children's  services, and/or the police department,
  and cooperate  in  the  investigation  related  thereto  to  the  extent
  permitted  by applicable state and federal law. For the purposes of this
  subdivision, "abused child" and "maltreated child" shall be  defined  in
  accordance  with  section four-hundred twelve of the social services law
  of New York, or as a person under the age of eighteen  whose  parent  or
  guardian  legally  responsible  for  such person's care inflicts serious
  physical injury upon such person, creates a substantial risk of  serious
  physical  injury, or commits an act of sexual abuse against such person.
  Reporting child abuse and maltreatment as defined in this subdivision to
  an individual or entity other than the statewide  central  registrar  of
  child abuse and maltreatment, the administration for children's services
  or the police department shall be a violation of this section.
