Section 20-750

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;   20-750  Display  of  service  prices.  (a)  Every  retail  service
  establishment must post, at each counter or desk  at  which  orders  are
  placed  and/or  payment  is  made,  a  list conspicuously displaying the
  current selling price of the basic services  provided.  The  list  shall
  also  disclose  factors  which may cause the price to be higher than the
  basic price, and the range of the possible additional charges when  such
  variables  pertain. (b) In the event of a special sale or promotion, the
  regular price list shall remain conspicuously visible.
    c. Notwithstanding any other law, rule or regulation, and in  addition
  to  any  other  penalties  provided  in  this  code  or  elsewhere,  the
  disclosure of differing prices or fees based upon  gender  by  a  retail
  service establishment shall constitute a violation of this subchapter.
