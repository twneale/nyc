Section 20-752

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  20-752  Regulations.  (a)  The  commissioner  shall promulgate such
  regulations as shall be necessary to effectuate  the  purposes  of  this
  subchapter,  including, but not limited to requirements as to the manner
  of display of service prices.
    (b) The commissioner may, by regulation, permit a printed list  to  be
  substituted for a posted list, in such classes of service establishments
  in  which  the commissioner determines that it would be impracticable to
  post because the list is subject to frequent changes, provided that  the
  printed  list  is  given  to  each  customer  upon  entering the service
  establishment.
