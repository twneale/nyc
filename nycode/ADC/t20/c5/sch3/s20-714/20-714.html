Section 20-714

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;   20-714   Regulations.   (a)   The  commissioner  shall  promulgate
  regulations designating those prescription drugs which, because  of  the
  frequency  with  which  they are prescribed, shall be posted pursuant to
  section 20-713. The commissioner may exempt from  such  regulation  such
  drugs  to  the  extent that, and under such conditions as are consistent
  with the policy of this subchapter whenever the commissioner shall  find
  that,  because of the nature of such prescription drugs, compliance with
  section 20-713 is unreasonably burdensome or  unnecessary  for  adequate
  protection of consumers.
    (b)  The commissioner shall promulgate such other regulations as shall
  be necessary to effectuate the purposes of this  subchapter,  including,
  but  not  limited  to,  requirements  as  to  the  manner  of display of
  prescription drug prices.
