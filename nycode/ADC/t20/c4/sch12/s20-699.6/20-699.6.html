  shall   be  conducted  in  accordance  with  rules  promulgated  by  the

  subdivision  shall  be  in  addition  to any other remedies or penalties
  provided for the enforcement of such  provisions  under  any  other  law
  including, but not limited to, civil or criminal actions or proceedings.
