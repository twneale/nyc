Section 20-672.1

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  20-672.1  Sales Record Keeping Requirements. a. Every retail dealer
  of petroleum products  shall  maintain  a  daily  sales  record  of  all
  petroleum  products  for  which  prices  are  required  to  be posted as
  provided in section 20-672. Such records shall document the total volume
  of each such type of product sold each day, the unit price and the total
  daily amount of sales for each such type of product, and  the  date  and
  time  when a change to the price posting specified in section 20-672 was
  made.
    b. All records required to be  maintained  shall  be  preserved  in  a
  manner  that  ensures their security and accessibility for inspection by
  the department for a period of one year.
    c.  All  records  required  to  be  maintained  shall   be   kept   in
  chronological  order,  either in writing or electronically, and shall be
  available for inspection by the department as follows:
    1. Records maintained in writing shall be  retained  at  the  premises
  where  sales are made for each of the immediately preceding thirty days.
  Such records shall be made available on demand to the department at such
  premises. The records required to be kept  for  the  period  beyond  the
  immediately  preceding  thirty days shall be presented at the offices of
  the department within five business days after demand  to  produce  them
  has been served on a retail dealer.
    2. Records maintained electronically shall be retained on the premises
  in  a  manner that displays the data for the entire period for which the
  electronic data system retains such data to permit an inspector to  view
  it  on  demand  on  the  device, and if such period is for less than the
  immediately preceding thirty days, then the data  must  be  provided  on
  demand  in a chronologically ordered print-out for the full thirty days.
  A complete and accurate  print  out  of  the  electronically  maintained
  records  that  are  required  to  be  kept  for  the  period  beyond the
  immediately preceding thirty days shall be presented at the  offices  of
  the  department  within  five business days after demand to produce them
  has been served on a retail dealer.
