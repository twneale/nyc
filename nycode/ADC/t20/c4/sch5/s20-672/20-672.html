  law, it shall be unlawful for any person, in connection with the sale or
  offer  for  sale  at  retail  of any petroleum products for use in motor
  vehicles or motor boats, other than gasoline or diesel  motor  fuel,  to
  post  or  maintain  at  such  place  of sale or offer to sale, any sign,
  placard or other display that states, relates or refers to the price  at
  which  such  petroleum  products are sold or offered for sale, except as
  follows:
    1. The price stated, mentioned or referred to on such sign, placard or
  other display, shall be by  the  unit  of  the  measure  at  which  such
  petroleum products are customarily sold at retail.
    2.  The  name, trade name, brand, mark or symbol, and grade or quality
  classification, if any, and  method  of  processing  of  such  petroleum
  products  shall  be  clearly  stated  on  such  signs,  placard or other
  display, and, if such petroleum products are sold without identification
  by name, trade name, brand, mark or symbol, such sign, placard or  other
  display shall refer clearly to such petroleum products as unbranded.
    b. In addition to any sign or placard required pursuant to subdivision
  five  of  section  one hundred ninety-two of the agriculture and markets
  law, there shall be a sign, poster or placard clearly visible to drivers
  of approaching motor vehicles on the premises of every location at which
  gasoline and/or diesel motor fuel are sold or  offered  for  sale.  Such
  sign  shall be in a size and style to be determined by the commissioner.
  Such sign, in addition  to  any  other  sign,  poster  or  placard  that
  advertises  the  selling  price  of  gasoline and directly or indirectly
  refers to a premises where the advertised gasoline and/or  diesel  motor
  fuel  are  sold  or  offered for sale, shall state the name, trade name,
  brand, mark or symbol  and  grade  or  quality  classification  of  such
  gasoline or diesel motor fuel, together with the total selling price per
  gallon.  Total  selling  price  shall  be the sum of the basic price per

    1. A retail dealer shall only sell at the  total  selling  price.  Any
  such  price  when posted may not be raised for a period of not less than
  twenty-four hours.
    2. Where the total selling price for purchases made with cash is  less
  than  the total selling price for purchases made with credit card, debit
  card or other form of non-cash payment, such  sign,  poster  or  placard
  shall state the total selling price for each type of accepted payment.
    c.  All numbers referring to price shall be the same height, width and
  thickness. Identification of the gasoline or diesel motor  fuel  offered
  for  sale,  and any non-numerical language distinguishing the total cash
  selling price from the total credit card, debit card or  other  form  of
  non-cash  payment selling price shall be in letters and numbers not less
  than one-half  of  the  height,  width  and  thickness  of  the  numbers
  referring  to  price.  Letters  and  numbers  shall  be black on a white
  background.
    d. Price per gallon indicator. Except as otherwise provided in article
  sixteen of the agriculture and markets law or in any rule or regulations
  promulgated thereunder, every gasoline or diesel motor  fuel  dispensing
  device  shall  be  equipped  with a price per gallon indicator and shall
  have such indicator correspond with the total price per  gallon  on  the
  sign,  poster  or  placard required to be posted pursuant to subdivision
  five of section one hundred ninety-two of such law or subdivision  b  of
  this section.

    e.  Total  price  indicator.  Every  gasoline  or  diesel  motor  fuel
  dispensing device shall be equipped with a total delivery indicator, and

  basis of posted price per gallon and number of gallons delivered.
