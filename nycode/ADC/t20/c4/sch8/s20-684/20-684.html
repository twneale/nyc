Section 20-684

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  20-684  Legislative intent. The council finds that consumers cannot
  be certain that food offered for sale is fresh or that  it  will  remain
  fresh for a reasonable period of time after it is purchased. The council
  particularly  recognizes  consumer  concern  with the freshness of foods
  including, but not limited to,  meat,  poultry,  fish,  dairy  products,
  eggs,  fruit, vegetables and baked goods. The council further finds that
  the food industry's practice of controlling food freshness through coded
  dates has proven inadequate for protection of the  public.  The  council
  has  concluded  that  a  mandatory  system  of  clear and legible dating
  accompanied by a statement of recommended conditions of storage  is  the
  best way to assure consumers of the freshness of the foods that they buy
  in stores.
