    &sect;  20-431  Revocation or suspension of a license. After due notice and
  hearing subject to section 20-432 the commissioner or the commissioner's
  designee  may  revoke  or  suspend  any  license  required  under   this
  subchapter or deny renewal of one upon a determination that a licensee:
    a.  Has  been convicted of a crime or offense which in the judgment of
  the commissioner would constitute evidence that the  licensee  would  be
  unfit  to  properly  discharge  his  or  her responsibilities under this
  subchapter.
    b. Has practiced fraud or misrepresentation  upon  a  customer  or  in
  establishing  his  or  her  qualifications  for  a  license  under  this
  subchapter.
    c. Has made  false  promises  of  a  character  likely  to  influence,
  persuade or induce a customer to authorize the sale, repair, maintenance
  or servicing of any product covered by this subchapter.
    d.  Has  failed to perform work or service in accordance with accepted
  trade standards.
    e. Has violated any of  the  provisions  of  this  subchapter  or  the
  regulations  promulgated  thereunder or has knowingly caused, permitted,
  aided or abetted another in committing such violation.
