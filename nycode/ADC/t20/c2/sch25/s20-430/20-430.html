Section 20-430

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  20-430 Duties of licensees. a. All work performed by a dealer shall
  be recorded legibly on an invoice which shall contain the license number
  and the exact name and  business  address  of  the  person  or  business
  entity.  The  invoice  shall  fully, separately and clearly describe the
  type and make of the device,  all  service  work  performed,  all  parts
  supplied,  the  date  or  dates  thereof,  and  all charges made and the
  computations thereof. A copy of the invoice shall be  delivered  to  the
  customer  and  the other shall be retained by the dealer for a period of
  at least three years from the date of such delivery.
    b. Upon request by telephone, in person or in writing, the dealer must
  provide information as to price and anticipated delivery  date  for  the
  rental,  sale,  repair  or  service  of  any  product  covered  by  this
  subchapter.
    c. The dealer must give a prospective customer a written estimate  for
  labor and parts required for a specific job if he or she intends to take
  the  job.  No  charge  for work performed or parts supplied in excess of
  twenty percent over written estimate shall be made unless the consent of
  the customer was  obtained  as  described  in  section  20-425  of  this
  subchapter  before  such  work  was  done,  parts  supplied  or services
  rendered.
    d. The dealer shall return all replaced parts to the customer,  except
  such  parts  as  may be exempted from this requirement by regulations of
  the commissioner and except such parts as the  service  dealer  requires
  for   return  to  the  manufacturer  or  distributor  under  a  warranty
  arrangement.
    e. A dealer shall not make the remuneration,  salary,  wage  or  other
  compensation  of  any  partner,  staff member, or employee contingent or
  dependent upon, or  in  any  manner  determined  by  the  value,  price,
  quantity  or  type  of  parts  replaced,  upon any apparatus serviced or
  repaired by any person required to be licensed by this subchapter.
    f. Every dealer shall maintain any additional records required  to  be
  kept  by  regulations  adopted by the commissioner for a period of three
  years. Such records must be available for inspection by the commissioner
  or other law enforcement officials.
    g. No dealer shall charge a total price, excluding tax, which is  more
  than twenty percent above the written estimate.
    h.  No  dealer  shall  fail  to deliver the repaired item or purchased
  goods, together with a final bill, as defined  above,  on  the  promised
  completion  date,  unless  the consumer is notified of the delay and the
  anticipated completion date.  If  complete  repair  is  delayed  for  an
  unreasonable  period  of  time  the consumer shall have the right to the
  immediate return of the property.
