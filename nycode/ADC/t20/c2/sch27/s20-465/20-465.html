    &sect;  20-465  Restrictions  on  the  placement of vehicles, pushcarts and
  stands; vending in certain areas prohibited. a. No general vendor  shall
  engage  in any vending business on any sidewalk unless such sidewalk has
  at least a twelve-foot wide clear pedestrian path to  be  measured  from
  the  boundary  of  any private property to any obstructions in or on the
  sidewalk, or if there are no obstructions, to  the  curb.  In  no  event
  shall  any  pushcart  or stand be placed on any part of a sidewalk other
  than that which abuts the curb.
    b. No general vendor shall occupy  more  than  eight  linear  feet  of
  public space parallel to the curb in the operation of a vending business
  and,  in  addition,  no general vendor operating any vending business on
  any sidewalk shall occupy more than three linear  feet  to  be  measured
  from the curb toward the property line.
    c.  No  vending  vehicle,  pushcart,  stand,  goods  or any other item
  related to the operation of a vending business shall touch, lean against
  or be affixed permanently or temporarily to any  building  or  structure
  including,  but  not  limited to lamp posts, parking meters, mail boxes,
  traffic signal stanchions,  fire  hydrants,  tree  boxes,  benches,  bus
  shelters, refuse baskets or traffic barriers.
    d.  No  vending  pushcart,  stand  or  goods  shall be located against
  display windows of fixed location businesses, nor shall they  be  within
  twenty  feet from any entranceway to any building, store, theatre, movie
  house, sports arena or other place of public assembly, or within  twenty
  feet  from  exits,  including  service  exits,  to  buildings  that  are
  exclusively residential at the street level.
    e. No general vendor shall vend within any bus  stop  or  taxi  stand,
  within  the  portion  of  the  sidewalk  abutting  any  no standing zone
  adjacent to a hospital as defined in subdivision one of section 2801  of
  the  New  York  state  public  health  law,  or  within  ten feet of any
  driveway, any subway entrance or exit, or any corner. For  the  purposes
  of  this  subdivision, ten feet from any corner shall be measured from a
  point where the property line on the nearest  intersecting  block  face,
  when extended, meets the curb.
    f.  Each  general  vendor  who  vends  from a pushcart or stand in the
  roadway shall obey all traffic and parking laws, rules  and  regulations
  as  now  exist  or as may be promulgated, but in no case shall a general
  vendor vend so as to restrict  the  continued  maintenance  of  a  clear
  passageway for vehicles.
    g.  (1)  No  general vendor shall vend on any street which is in a C4,
  C5, or C6 zoning district, or in the area bounded on the east by  Second
  Avenue,  on  the  south by Thirtieth Street, on the west by Ninth Avenue
  and Columbus Avenue and on the north by Sixty-fifth Street, except  that
  as chairperson of the street vendor review panel established pursuant to
  section  20-465.1 of this subchapter, the commissioner of the department
  of  small  business  services  or  his  or  her  designee  may   receive
  applications  from  any  person,  group, organization or other entity to
  permit general vendors on any street within said area or said zones,  or
  to prohibit general vendors on any other street. Such applications shall
  be  considered  by the street vendor review panel in accordance with the
  procedures enumerated in section 20-465.1 of this subchapter.
    (2) No general vendor shall vend on any street which is  in  the  area
  including  and  bounded on the east by the easterly side of Broadway, on
  the south by the southerly side of Liberty Street, on the  west  by  the
  westerly  side  of West Street and on the north by the northerly side of
  Vesey Street.
    (3) Upon issuance of a new general vendor license or a renewal  of  an
  existing  license,  the  commissioner shall provide a copy of subchapter
  twenty-seven of chapter two of this title and of the rules of  the  city

  of  New  York  implementing  such  subchapter  to  such  new  or renewal
  licensee.
    i.  No  general  vendor  shall  vend  on the median strip of a divided
  roadway unless such strip is intended for use as a  pedestrian  mall  or
  plaza.
    j.  No  general  vendor shall vend within the geographical areas under
  the jurisdiction of  the  department  of  parks  and  recreation  unless
  written  authorization  therefor has been obtained from the commissioner
  of such department, but  nothing  therein  contained  shall  exempt  any
  general  vendor  from  obtaining  a  license  in  accordance  with  this
  subchapter.
    k. Where exigent circumstances exist and a  police  officer  or  other
  authorized  officer  or  employee  of  any city agency gives notice to a
  general vendor to temporarily move from any location such general vendor
  shall not vend from such location. For the purposes of this subdivision,
  exigent circumstances shall include, but not be  limited  to,  unusually
  heavy  pedestrian or vehicular traffic, existence of any obstructions in
  the public space, an accident, fire  or  other  emergency  situation,  a
  parade,  demonstration or other such event or occurrence at or near such
  location.
    m. No general vendor shall vend over  any  ventilation  grill,  cellar
  door, manhole, transformer vault, or subway access grating.
    n.  No general vendor shall vend using the surface of the sidewalk, or
  a blanket or board placed immediately on the sidewalk or  on  top  of  a
  trash  receptacle  or cardboard boxes to display merchandise. No general
  vendor display may exceed five feet in height  from  ground  level.  The
  display may not be less than twenty-four inches above the sidewalk where
  the  display  surface  is  parallel to the sidewalk, and may not be less
  than twelve inches above the  sidewalk  where  the  display  surface  is
  vertical.    Where a rack or other display structure is placed on top of
  or above a table or other base, the size of the base shall not  be  less
  than  the size of the display structure placed thereon. Nothing shall be
  placed on the base so as to exceed the  size  limitations  contained  in
  this section.  No general vendor shall use any area other than that area
  immediately  beneath the surface of the display space for the storage of
  items for sale.
    o. No general vendor shall sell or offer for sale  any  item  directly
  from any parked or double parked motor vehicle.
    p.  No  general  vendor  shall  use electricity, electrical generating
  equipment or oil or gasoline powered equipment, devices or machinery  of
  any kind.
