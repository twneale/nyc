Section 20-474.1

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;   20-474.1   Delivery  to  general  vendors;  distributor's  license
  required.  a. It shall be unlawful for any individual to transport goods
  by means of a motor vehicle, as defined in the vehicle and traffic  law,
  to  a  public  space  for  sale  or  other transfer to a general vendor,
  without having first obtained a distributor's license in accordance with
  the provisions of this subchapter. For  the  purpose  of  this  section,
  "distributor"  shall be defined as any person or organization engaged in
  the sale, consignment, or distribution of goods for sale or resale by  a
  general  vendor. This shall not include an owner of goods who personally
  operates a motor vehicle to transport such goods exclusively to and from
  a location from which the owner  will  personally  sell  such  goods  in
  compliance  with  all  applicable laws. For the purpose of this section,
  "public space" shall be defined as all publicly owned  property  between
  the  property  lines on a street as such property lines are shown on the
  City map including but not limited to a park, plaza, roadway,  shoulder,
  tree  space,  sidewalk  or parking space between such property lines. It
  shall also include, but not be limited  to,  publicly  owned  or  leased
  land, buildings, piers, wharfs, stadiums, and terminals.
    b.  Where the distributor does not personally drive the vehicle, he or
  she shall cause the driver to carry proof of the distributor's  license,
  which  the  driver  shall  furnish  upon  demand to any officer or agent
  empowered to enforce the law. No distributor shall permit any driver  he
  or  she  employs  to  engage in, on the distributor's behalf, any of the
  activities for which a license is required unless such  driver  complies
  with all regulations promulgated pursuant to this subchapter.
    c.  Each  person  applying  for  a  distributor's  license, or renewal
  thereof, shall file an application  in  such  form  and  detail  as  the
  commissioner  may  prescribe  and shall pay such license fee as shall be
  established by the commissioner by regulation. In addition to any  other
  information  required,  the  commissioner  shall  require  the following
  information:
    1. The name and home and business address of the applicant;
    2. The name and home and business address of the owner, if other  than
  the applicant, of the goods to be delivered;
    3. A description of the type of goods or services to be delivered;
    4.  Three  prints of a full-face photograph of the applicant taken not
  more than thirty days prior to the date of the application;
    5. Proof that the applicant has obtained from the state tax commission
  of the state of New York a  certificate  of  authority  designating  the
  applicant's sales tax identification number;
    6.  An  applicant  who is a non-resident of the city shall provide the
  name and address of a registered agent within the city or designate  the
  commissioner as his or her agent upon whom process or other notification
  may be served;
    7.  Any  changes  in the information provided in an application for an
  original license or renewal thereof, which arise during the term of  the
  license  shall  be reported to the commissioner in writing within thirty
  days.
