    &sect;  20-457  License  renewal.  a.  An  application for the renewal of a
  license shall be filed with the appropriate fee, with  a  tax  clearance
  certificate issued by the state tax commission of the state of New York,
  and  with  a  tax  clearance  certificate  issued by the commissioner of
  finance of the city of New  York,  in  such  form  and  containing  such
  information  as  he  or  she  shall  require,  indicating payment of all
  applicable taxes imposed by title eleven of this code  and  administered
  by  the  commissioner  of  finance,  at  least  thirty days prior to the
  expiration of the existing license. The commissioner  of  finance  shall
  charge  and  collect  a  fee  of ten dollars for issuing a tax clearance
  certificate.
    b. No licensee shall be granted a renewal  of  a  license  unless  the
  licensee  is in compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated by
  the commissioner of finance pursuant to subdivision c of  this  section;
  provided,  however,  that the commissioner may excuse such failure which
  results from illness or disability.
    c. The commissioner of finance shall promulgate rules and  regulations
  establishing  (1)  such  standards  of  sales tax payments sufficient to
  indicate that operating as a general vendor is a full-time or  part-time
  occupation  of  the  licensee  and  (2)  that  a  minimum payment of all
  applicable sales and business taxes imposed by title eleven of the  code
  and  administered  by  the commissioner of finance have been paid during
  the preceding calendar year.
