Section 20-474.2

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  20-474.2  Delivery  vehicle  identification  required. a. No person
  shall engage in any  activity  for  which  a  distributor's  license  is
  required  unless  the  motor  vehicle used therefor is identified in the
  manner prescribed by law or regulation.
    b. Any vehicle used by a distributor to transport goods to  a  general
  vendor  must be visually identified by a sign conspicuously displayed on
  the side of the vehicle. The following information shall be clearly  and
  legibly  displayed  on  such  sign:  the  licensee's  name, address, and
  business telephone number; the words "General Vending Distributor";  and
  the department's telephone complaint number. The letters and numerals of
  such  display  shall not be less than one and one-half inches in height,
  with a width of at least one-quarter of an inch, and  shall  be  colored
  black  or  white,  whichever  is  most  prominent against the background
  color.
    c. Signs used to identify delivery vehicles may be removable, but must
  be securely fastened whenever the vehicle is used to deliver  or  remove
  goods  to  or  from  a  general  vendor.  The  sign must remain securely
  attached throughout the time it takes to load or unload goods.
