  shall deem pertinent.
    (2)  Every  amusement  device  owner,  gaming  cafe owner or amusement
  arcade owner must submit to the department either a valid certificate of
  occupancy or an equivalent document duly issued  by  the  department  of
  buildings  stating  that  the  premises  in which such amusement device,
  gaming cafe or amusement arcade is to be located is situated in an  area
  which  is zoned to permit such use or a valid, current permit or special
  permit has been granted by the appropriate city agency  permitting  such
  use at the given location. If such permit or special permit shall expire
  or  be terminated for any reason during the pendency of any license, the
  licensee shall present to the department a new permit or special  permit
  authorizing  such continued use of the premises for an amusement device,
  gaming cafe or amusement arcade. If such new permit or special permit is
  not presented within ten days of the expiration of the prior  permit  or
  special  permit, such amusement device license, gaming cafe or amusement
  arcade  license  shall  be  terminated  automatically  and  without  any
  requirement of notice or hearing by the department.
    (3)  Within fifteen days of receipt of a new application for a license
  to operate an amusement device, gaming cafe or an amusement arcade,  the

  community board shall have fifteen days from receipt of the notification
  to comment on such application to the department.
    (4)  The  commissioner  shall  promptly  notify the affected community
  board and the council member for that district of the final  disposition
  of  any license application that was subject to comment by the community

  effects  on  the  surrounding  area,  including,  but  not  limited  to,
  prescribing  hours  of  operation  and  requirements  for  security  and
  supervision.  After a license is granted, the commissioner may prescribe
  such conditions from time to time upon  notice  and  opportunity  to  be
  heard.
    (2)  Each player-operated amusement device located within an amusement
  arcade or gaming cafe  shall  display  a  sign  or  signs,  located  and
  designed so as to be discernible by all players and prospective players,
  setting forth the rules of play, including the price of each game.
    (3)  Where  the amusement arcade or gaming cafe owner or the amusement
  operator in the amusement arcade or gaming cafe  offers  free  games  or
  prizes,  signs  shall  be required to set out with clarity the number of
  wins or the score required to obtain a free  game  or  prize;  provided,

  redeemed  in  money  at the amusement arcade or gaming cafe or any other
  establishment, or which may be used as a credit or  allowance  or  which

  amusement  arcade  or gaming cafe between the hours of nine a.m. through
  three p.m. on weekdays during the regularly scheduled  school  year  for
  public  schools.  Such  owners  shall prominently display a sign stating
  that, unless exempt by New  York  State  Education  Law,  persons  under
  eighteen years of age are not to enter or remain on the premises at such
  times  and  that  the  truancy  laws  of  the  state of New York will be
  enforced.
    d. Placement and Operation. No  amusement  device  or  player-operated
  amusement  device  or  group of amusement devices and/or player-operated
  amusement devices shall be placed or operated in such  a  manner  as  to

  interfere  with,  any  public corridor or passageway, or to obstruct the
  entrance or exit to any premises. No amusement device or player-operated
