<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  20-226  Review  and approval of petitions for revocable consents to
  operate unenclosed sidewalk cafes which do not require special  permits.
  A  petition  for  a  revocable consent to operate an unenclosed sidewalk
  cafe which does not require  a  special  permit  modification  shall  be
  reviewed and approved in the following manner:
    a. The petition shall be in such form as prescribed by the department.
  The department shall forward copies of the petition, within five days of
  the  filing  of such petition, to the speaker of council and the council
  member in whose district  the  cafe  is  proposed  to  be  located,  for
  information  purposes,  and  to  the  community  board for the community
  district in which the  cafe  is  proposed  to  be  located,  for  review
  pursuant to subdivision b of this section.
    b.  The  community  board  shall, not later than forty-five days after
  receipt of such petition, either (i) notify the public of the  petition,
  conduct  a public hearing thereon and submit a written recommendation to
  the department and to the council or (ii) waive by a  written  statement
  its  public  hearing and recommendation on such petition and submit such
  statement to the department and to the  council.  The  petitioner  shall
  amend  the petition if both the community board and the petitioner agree
  to modifications in writing. Such modifications shall  be  reflected  in
  the written recommendations of the community board to the department and
  the council.
    c.  The department shall hold a public hearing pursuant to subdivision
  d of this section and approve the petition, disapprove it or approve  it
  with   modifications  within  thirty  days  of  the  expiration  of  the
  forty-five-day period allowed for the filing of a recommendation by  the
  community  board.  If  within  the  time period provided, the department
  fails to take the actions on a petition provided for  in  the  preceding
  sentence,  the  petition shall be deemed to have been denied. Within the
  thirty-day time period provided for in this subdivision, the  department
  shall file with the council any such decision to approve or approve with
  modifications, together with the petition.
    d.  The  department shall hold a public hearing on each petition prior
  to approving, approving with modifications or disapproving the petition.
  For a period of not less than fifteen calendar days prior to the date of
  such public hearing, the petitioner shall  post  notice  of  the  public
  hearing  in  a  place  conspicuous to public view at the location of the
  proposed sidewalk cafe. At least fifteen days prior to the date  of  the
  hearing,  the department will give notice to the community board for the
  district in which the cafe is proposed to be located, to  the  president
  of  the  borough  in which the cafe is proposed to be located and to the
  council member in whose district the cafe is proposed to be located. Not
  less than five-calendar days prior to the  date  of  any  such  hearing,
  notice  of  the hearing shall be published in the City Record and in one
  newspaper of local circulation  in  the  community  where  the  cafe  is
  proposed  to  be  located.  No  other notice requirements shall apply to
  hearings for revocable consents for sidewalk cafes.
    e. Within twenty days of the date the  petition  is  received  by  the
  council  pursuant  to  subdivision  c  of  this section, the council may
  resolve by majority vote of  all  the  council  members  to  review  the
  petition.  If  the  council  does  not  so  resolve, the approval of the
  petition by the department shall be forwarded to the mayor for  approval
  pursuant to subdivision g of this section.
    f.   If  the  council  resolves  to  review  a  petition  pursuant  to
  subdivision e of this section, the council shall hold a public  hearing,
  after  giving  public  notice not less than five days in advance of such
  hearing. The council shall take final action on the petition  and  shall
  file with the mayor its resolution, if any, with respect to the petition

  within  fifty  days  of  the  filing  of  the  petition with the council
  pursuant to subdivision c of this section. The  affirmative  vote  of  a
  majority  of  all  the  council  members  shall  be required to approve,
  approve  with modifications or disapprove the petition. Any modification
  by the council shall not affect the  terms  of  any  proposed  revocable
  consent  agreement  which  relate  to  term, compensation, revocability,
  exclusivity, security, insurance, indemnification, erection, maintenance
  or removal of any structure, right of access by the city and  rights  of
  abutting property owners. If within the time period provided for in this
  subdivision,  the  council  fails to act or fails to act by the required
  vote on a petition, the council shall be deemed  to  have  approved  the
  petition.  If  within  the time period provided for in this subdivision,
  the council approves the petition  with  modifications,  the  petitioner
  shall accept such modifications within fifteen days of such approval, or
  the council shall be deemed to have denied the petition.
    g.  The consent shall be for such term and upon such conditions as may
  be provided in the approval of the petition by the department,  as  such
  approval   may  be  modified  by  action  of  the  council  pursuant  to
  subdivision f of this section, but shall be revocable at any time by the
  department. The separate and additional approval of the mayor  shall  be
  necessary to its validity.
    h.  Consents  for  sidewalk  cafes  shall  provide for fees to be paid
  annually to the city during the continuance of the  consent.  Such  fees
  shall  be  calculated  pursuant  to  a formula established by rule or by
  local law, which shall apply uniformly to all  consents  for  unenclosed
  sidewalk  cafes.  The  department  shall file with the council a written
  recommendation for a formula to be used to calculate such fees.
    i. An unenclosed sidewalk cafe may not be opened or operated prior  to
  the  approval of the consent therefor by the department pursuant to this
  section.
