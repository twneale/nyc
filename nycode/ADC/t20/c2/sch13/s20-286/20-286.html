  auctioneer to demand or receive for his or her services, in selling,  at
  public  auction,  any real estate directed to be sold by any judgment or
  decree of any court of this state, a greater fee than fifty dollars  for
  each  parcel  separately  sold,  except that in all sales of real estate
  conducted by any auctioneer pursuant to a  judgment  or  decree  of  any
  court  of  this  state  in any action brought to foreclose a mortgage or
  other lien on real estate, the fees of  such  auctioneers  shall  be  as
  follows:
    1. in all cases where the judgment of foreclosure is for an amount not
  exceeding five thousand dollars, the fee shall be fifteen dollars;
    2.  in all cases where the judgment of foreclosure is for an amount in
  excess of five thousand dollars, but not exceeding twenty-five  thousand
  dollars, the fee shall be twenty-five dollars;
    3.  in all cases where the judgment of foreclosure is for an amount in
  excess of twenty-five thousand dollars, the fee shall be fifty dollars.
    b. Where such sale is made at any public  salesroom,  such  auctioneer
  may demand and receive such further amount not exceeding ten dollars for
  each  parcel separately sold as he or she may have actually paid for the
  privilege or right of making the sale in such salesroom.
    c. Where one or more lots are so  sold  at  public  auction  with  the
  option  to  the  purchaser  of taking one or more additional lots at the
  same rates or price, nothing herein  contained  shall  be  construed  to
  prevent the auctioneer making such sale from demanding and receiving for
  his  or  her  services  the  compensation or fee above allowed, for each
  additional lot taken by such purchaser under such option.
