<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 20-279 Fee; bond; fingerprinting. a. The annual fee for such license
  shall be two hundred dollars.
    b. Each applicant for such license shall file with the commissioner, a
  bond  with  two good sureties, in the penal sum of two thousand dollars,
  which bond shall meet with the approval of the commissioner.
    c. The commissioner shall require that applicants for licenses  issued
  pursuant to this subchapter be fingerprinted for the purpose of securing
  criminal  history  records  from  the state division of criminal justice
  services. The applicant shall pay a processing fee as  required  by  the
  state division of criminal justice services. Fingerprints shall be taken
  of  the  individual owner if the applicant is a sole proprietorship; the
  general partners if the applicant is a partnership;  and  the  officers,
  principals,  directors, and stockholders owning more than ten percent of
  the  outstanding  stock  of  the  corporation  if  the  applicant  is  a
  corporation.  Any  person  required  to be fingerprinted hereunder shall
  furnish to the department three current  passport-sized  photographs  of
  such  person.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing, the commissioner need not
  require applicants for licenses required under  this  subchapter  to  be
  fingerprinted if criminal history records concerning such applicants are
  not available from the state division of criminal justice services.
