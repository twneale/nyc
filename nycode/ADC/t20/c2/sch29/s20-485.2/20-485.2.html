  this   subchapter   and   any  rules  promulgated  by  the  commissioner
  thereunder. The commissioner may refuse to issue  to  an  applicant  any
  license  required  under this subchapter based upon a determination made

  engaged in conduct which would constitute a basis for license suspension
  or revocation as set forth in section 20-485.3 of this subchapter.
