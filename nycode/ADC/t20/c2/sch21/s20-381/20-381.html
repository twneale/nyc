Section 20-381

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 20-381 Horse drawn cab driver's license. a. It shall be unlawful for
  any person to operate a horse drawn cab within the city without having a
  valid horse drawn cab driver's license from the commissioner.
    b.  The  biennial  fee  for each such horse drawn cab driver's license
  shall be thirty dollars.
    c. The commissioner shall investigate each applicant as  to  character
  and fitness before such license shall be issued.
    d.  A  horse drawn cab driver's license shall not be issued or renewed
  unless the applicant  therefor  has  submitted  to  the  commissioner  a
  certificate  issued  by  the  commissioner of health pursuant to section
  17-334.1 of the code.
    e. It shall be unlawful for any owner of a horse drawn cab  to  permit
  such  horse  drawn cab to be operated by a person who does not possess a
  current valid driver's license issued pursuant to this section.  In  any
  prosecution of an owner for a violation of this section, it shall not be
  necessary  to  prove  that  the owner knew or should have known that the
  driver was unlicensed, and there shall be a rebuttable presumption  that
  such cab was operated with the permission of the owner.
    f.  An  applicant  who  has  not  previously held a license under this
  section shall be issued a probationary license upon approval of  his  or
  her application. A holder of a probationary license may ride alongside a
  licensed  driver at any time. A probationary license shall be valid from
  the date of issuance until six months after the date of issuance and may
  be revoked for any violation of the rules and regulations pertaining  to
  rental horses and horse drawn cabs. Until he or she accrues eighty hours
  time  spent  operating  a  horse  drawn  cab, a holder of a probationary
  license shall only be permitted to operate a horse drawn cab at  staging
  areas  immediately  adjacent  to  Central  Park and on roadways or paths
  wholly within a New York City park.  Following  the  accrual  of  eighty
  hours  of  time  spent  operating  a  horse  drawn  cab,  a  holder of a
  probationary license shall be permitted to operate a horse drawn cab  to
  or  from  a  stable  at  any time. For the purposes of this subsection a
  person shall be considered to be operating a horse drawn cab  if  he  or
  she  is  holding  the reins of a horse attached to a horse drawn cab and
  directing such horse's movements while the cab  is  in  motion.  At  the
  conclusion  of  six  months, if the probationary licensee has accrued no
  violations under subchapter 3  of  title  17  or  this  subchapter,  the
  licensee  shall  be  issued a horse drawn cab driver's license under the
  terms of this subchapter.
