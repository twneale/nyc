Section 20-374

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  20-374  Granting and transferring of licenses. a. Any person, firm,
  partnership,  corporation  or  association,  owning   or   operating   a
  sight-seeing  bus, or buses, or horse-drawn cab, or cabs engaging in the
  business of transporting passengers in, about, over and upon any of  the
  streets,  avenues, bridges, highways, boulevards or public places within
  the limits of the city of New York, shall be issued a license  for  each
  bus  or  cab  so  operating,  provided,  however  any such person, firm,
  partnership,  corporation  or  association   owning   or   operating   a
  sight-seeing  bus  or  buses,  shall  first  have  obtained a license or
  licenses,  as  he  or  she  shall  be  entitled  to  receive  from   the
  commissioner  of  motor  vehicles  of  the state of New York as made and
  provided by law.
    b. It shall be unlawful for a  license,  after  being  issued  by  the
  commissioner,  to  be  transferred  to  any  person,  firm, partnership,
  corporation  or  association  for  any  cause  whatsoever,  except  that
  licenses  for  horse-drawn  cabs may be transferred with the approval of
  the  commissioner.  Upon  voluntary  sale  or  transfer  of  a  licensed
  horse-drawn  cab  by  the  holder  of  a  license  or  his  or her legal
  representative, the licensee shall immediately notify  the  commissioner
  of  his  or  her  intention  to  replace  such horse-drawn cab, or shall
  surrender his or her license. If the license is surrendered, the  vendee
  or transferee may make application to the commissioner for the licensing
  of  the horse-drawn cab so purchased. A new license shall then be issued
  by the commissioner in place of the license so surrendered, provided the
  applicant has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the commissioner  that
  he  or  she  is  qualified  to  assume  the  duties and obligations of a
  horse-drawn cab license.
    c.  The  commissioner  shall  issue  additional  licenses  only  after
  conducting a public hearing to determine whether the public convenience,
  welfare  and  necessity  require the operation of additional horse-drawn
  cabs. The public hearing shall be called upon his or her own  motion  or
  upon  written  request  by  any applicant. Notice of such public hearing
  shall be published in the City Record once a week  for  two  consecutive
  weeks  and shall be mailed to all current licensees. If the commissioner
  shall determine that  additional  horse-drawn  cabs  are  necessary  and
  advisable,  he  or  she  shall  certify the number of new licenses to be
  granted. Not more than one such public hearing shall be held during  any
  calendar year and the commissioner may refuse to consider any request if
  it  appears  that  a recent public hearing has adequately considered the
  question. In making his or her  determination,  the  commissioner  shall
  consider among other things, the income of the driver, the income of the
  owner,  the effect upon traffic, and the public demand. The new licenses
  which are granted shall be allocated to the then existent  licensees  in
  the  ratio  of  the number of licenses held by the licensee to the total
  number of licenses issued and in effect. If a licensee does  not  accept
  his  or  her  allotted  number  within sixty days, his or her additional
  licenses shall be allocated in  the  same  manner  among  the  remaining
  licensees.   If   the   number  of  additional  licenses  authorized  is
  insufficient to permit such  allocation,  then  the  distribution  among
  those  licensees  entitled to the smallest number of additional licenses
  shall be made so that priority shall be given to  those  who  have  been
  uninterruptedly licensed for the longest period. New applicants for such
  additional  licenses shall be considered only when the present licensees
  refuse to accept their allocation of licenses  in  the  manner  provided
  above.  The  distribution  of such additional licenses to new applicants
  shall be in the order of their filing, provided however  that  each  new
  applicant shall not be entitled to more than one such additional license

  until  each  new applicant who has filed at the time of distribution and
  who is otherwise eligible has received one license.
