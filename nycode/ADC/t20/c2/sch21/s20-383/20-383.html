  to be heard, the commissioner may suspend or revoke any sight-seeing bus
  license where the holder has failed to comply  with  any  provisions  of
  this  subchapter  or  of  the  rules promulgated thereunder, or with any
  other laws or rules governing sight-seeing buses, or which  sight-seeing
  bus  is otherwise found to be unfit for operation. Such suspension shall
  remain in effect until compliance and fitness have been  established  by
  the  licensee  and accepted by the department. Grounds for suspension or
  revocation shall include, but not be  limited  to,  installation  of  an
  engine  which does not meet the requirements of subdivision b of section
  20-376 of this subchapter, being found to have violated the requirements
  for diesel fuel-powered sight-seeing buses contained in section 24-163.6
  of the administrative code, failure to  submit  a  bus  for  inspection,
  installation  of an engine not covered by a certificate of conformity in
  a vehicle which was originally manufactured  with  such  an  engine  and
  installation  of  an  engine  of  any  model  year preceding the year of
  manufacture in a vehicle  which  was  originally  manufactured  with  an
  engine covered by a certificate of conformity.

  twelve-month period, in the aggregate, at least three violations of this
  subchapter shall have his or her license suspended by  the  commissioner
  for  a  period  of  not  less  than  three  months. For purposes of this
  subdivision, all violations written on any one day  shall  constitute  a
  single violation.
    c.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions of subdivision b of this section,
  any driver of a horse drawn cab  found  to  have  committed  within  any
  twenty-four  month period, in the aggregate, at least five violations of
  this  subchapter  shall  have  his  or  her  license  suspended  by  the
  commissioner  for  six  months.  For  purposes  of this subdivision, all
  violations written on any one day shall constitute a single violation.

  hundred  fifty-one,  three hundred fifty-three, three hundred fifty-five
  through three hundred sixty-two or three hundred sixty-nine of  the  New
  York  state  agriculture  and  markets  law  or who is found guilty of a
  violation of this subchapter while his  or  her  license  is  suspended,
