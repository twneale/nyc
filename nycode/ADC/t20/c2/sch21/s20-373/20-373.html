Section 20-373

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  20-373  License  required;  fee;  term.  a. It shall be unlawful to
  operate or permit another to operate for  hire  a  sight-seeing  bus  or
  horse-drawn  cab  within  the  city  unless  the  owner shall have first
  obtained a license therefor from the commissioner. An  applicant  for  a
  horse-drawn cab license shall be at least eighteen years of age.
    b.  Fees.  The  original and renewal license fee for each sight-seeing
  bus shall be fifty dollars and for each horse-drawn cab shall  be  fifty
  dollars.
    c. The commissioner shall not renew any horse-drawn cab license in the
  event  that  he  or she shall determine that the horse-drawn cab has not
  been operated for at least four  months  during  the  preceding  license
  year,  provided  that such failure to operate shall not have been caused
  by strike, riot, war or other public catastrophe. However, in the  event
  that  it  is  shown  to  the  commissioner  by  competent proof that the
  licensee has been disabled through illness or has been unable to operate
  the horse-drawn cab because of other cause beyond his  or  her  control,
  the commissioner may renew such license.
    d. The commissioner may refuse to renew any horse drawn cab license in
  the  event  that he or she determines that the holder of the horse drawn
  cab license has demonstrated a disregard  for  the  provisions  of  this
  subchapter as illustrated by repeated violations of such provisions.
