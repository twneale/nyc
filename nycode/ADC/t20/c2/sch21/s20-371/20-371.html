Section 20-371

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  20-371  Licensing of sight-seeing buses, horse drawn cabs and horse
  drawn  cab  drivers.  Legislative  findings.  The  legislative  findings
  heretofore  made  in  relation to the business of sight-seeing buses and
  horse drawn cabs in the city of New York and  set  forth  in  local  law
  number  ten  of  nineteen  hundred sixty-four continue to be valid; such
  businesses are vested with a public interest and  their  regulation  and
  control  continue  to  be  necessary and essential in order to cope with
  certain evils and hazards which existed in the absence  of  governmental
  supervision.   The  supervision  formerly  was  reposed  in  the  police
  commissioner, but recent experience and study indicate that jurisdiction
  over such businesses should be transferred to the  commissioner.  It  is
  further  found  that  the present number of horse drawn cabs licensed in
  the city of New York is adequate to meet the public need and demand  and
  should  be  preserved,  unless  the  commissioner  finds that additional
  licenses are necessary and advisable.
