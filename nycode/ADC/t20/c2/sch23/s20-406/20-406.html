Section 20-406

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  20-406  Application;  fingerprinting.  a. An application for such a
  license or renewal thereof shall be made to the commissioner on  a  form
  prescribed by him or her.
    b.  The commissioner shall require that applicants for licenses issued
  pursuant to this subchapter be fingerprinted for the purpose of securing
  criminal history records from the state  division  of  criminal  justice
  services.  The  applicant  shall pay a processing fee as required by the
  state division of criminal justice services. Fingerprints shall be taken
  of the individual owner if the applicant is a sole  proprietorship;  the
  general  partners  if  the applicant is a partnership; and the officers,
  principals, directors, and stockholders owning more than ten percent  of
  the  outstanding  stock  of  the  corporation  if  the  applicant  is  a
  corporation. Any person required to  be  fingerprinted  hereunder  shall
  furnish  to  the  department three current passport-sized photographs of
  such person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the  commissioner  need  not
  require  applicants  for  licenses  required under this subchapter to be
  fingerprinted if criminal history records concerning such applicants are
  not available from the state division of criminal justice services.
    c. Each such applicant for a process server license or renewal thereof
  shall  be  required  to  pass  an   examination   satisfactorily.   Such
  examination shall be under the supervision of the commissioner and shall
  test the knowledge of the applicant concerning proper service of process
  within  the  city  of  New  York  and familiarity with relevant laws and
  rules.
