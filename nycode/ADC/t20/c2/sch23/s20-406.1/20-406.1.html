Section 20-406.1

<pre>
    
 
    20-406.1 Bond required. a. As a condition of the issuance of a process
  server  license,  each  applicant  for such license or a renewal thereof
  shall furnish  to  the  commissioner  a  surety  bond  executed  by  the
  applicant in the sum of ten thousand dollars, payable to the city of New
  York,  and  a  surety  approved  by the commissioner. Such bond shall be
  conditioned upon the applicant's compliance with the provisions of  this
  subchapter  and  any  rules promulgated thereunder, and upon the further
  condition that the applicant will pay (i) to the city any fine,  penalty
  or  other  obligation  the  city imposes relating to a violation of this
  subchapter and any rules promulgated thereunder, and (ii) to a plaintiff
  any final judgment recovered in an action arising out of  the  violation
  of  any  of  the provisions of this subchapter within thirty days of its
  imposition. If an applicant  is  unable  to  obtain  a  surety  bond  as
  required  by  this section, and upon the provision of proof satisfactory
  to the commissioner of such inability, the individual applicant may,  in
  lieu  of  furnishing  such  bond,  deposit an amount of no less than one
  thousand dollars in a fund to be established by the commissioner to  pay
  (i)  to  the city any fine, penalty or other obligation the city imposes
  relating to a violation of this subchapter  and  any  rules  promulgated
  thereunder,  and  (ii) to a plaintiff any final judgment recovered in an
  action arising out of the violation of any of  the  provisions  of  this
  subchapter within thirty days of its imposition.
    b.  A process server licensed under this subchapter who engages in the
  business of serving process exclusively as  an  employee  of  a  process
  serving  agency  licensed under this subchapter shall not be required to
  furnish a surety bond.
    c. As a condition of the issuance of a process serving agency license,
  each applicant for such license or a renewal thereof  shall  furnish  to
  the  commissioner  a  surety  bond  in  the  sum of one hundred thousand
  dollars executed by the applicant payable to the city of New York, and a
  surety approved by the commissioner. Such bond shall be conditioned upon
  the applicant's compliance with the provisions of  this  subchapter  and
  any  rules  promulgated  thereunder, and upon the further condition that
  the applicant will pay (i) to  the  city  any  fine,  penalty  or  other
  obligation  the  city imposes relating to a violation of this subchapter
  and any rules promulgated thereunder, and (ii) to a plaintiff any  final
  judgment  recovered  in an action arising out of the violation of any of
  the provisions of this subchapter within thirty days of its imposition.
