    &sect; 20-497 Application; fingerprinting; fee; term. a. An application for
  any  license  required  under this subchapter or for any renewal thereof
  shall be made to the commissioner in such form and manner as he  or  she
  shall  prescribe  by regulation. An applicant for any such license shall
  be fingerprinted by the department for the purpose of securing  criminal
  history  records  from  the state division of criminal justice services.
  The applicant shall pay a  processing  fee  as  required  by  the  state
  division  of  criminal  justice  services. Where the applicant is a sole
  proprietorship, fingerprints shall be taken of the owner thereof.  Where
  the  applicant  is  a  partnership,  fingerprints  shall be taken of the
  general  partners  thereof.  Where  the  applicant  is  a   corporation,
  fingerprints  shall  be taken of the officers, principals, directors and
  stockholders owning more than ten percent of the  outstanding  stock  of
  the corporation. Any person required to be fingerprinted hereunder shall
  furnish  to  the  department  three current passport size photographs of
  such person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the  commissioner  need  not
  require  applicants  for  licenses  required under this subchapter to be
  fingerprinted if criminal history records concerning such applicants are
  not available from the state division of criminal justice services.
    b. There shall be a biennial fee for a license to engage in towing and
  for each tow truck in excess of one operated pursuant to  such  license.
  Such  fee for a license to engage in towing shall be six hundred dollars
  and such fee for each tow truck in excess of one shall  be  six  hundred
  dollars.  There  shall  be  a  biennial  fee  for a tow truck operator's
  license. The fee for such tow truck operator's license shall  be  twenty
  dollars.  In  the  event  of  the loss, mutilation or destruction of any
  license issued hereunder, the licensee may file such statement and proof
  of facts as the commissioner  shall  require,  with  a  fee  of  fifteen
  dollars per license, at the department, and the department shall issue a
  duplicate or substitute license.
    c.  All  licenses  issued to a business pursuant to this subchapter to
  engage in  towing  and  all  license  plates  issued  pursuant  to  this
  subchapter  for  tow  trucks  shall  expire  on April thirtieth, in even
  numbered years, and all licenses issued pursuant to this  subchapter  to
  tow  truck  drivers  to  operate  tow  trucks  shall  expire  on October
  thirty-first, in even years, unless sooner suspended or revoked.
