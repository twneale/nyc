Section 20-505

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  20-505  Tow  truck  operator's  license  suspension  or revocation;
  special circumstances. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, where
  the commissioner has reason to believe that a  tow  truck  operator  has
  committed  an  act  which  would  provide  a  basis  for  suspension  or
  revocation under section 20-504 or 20-504.1 of this subchapter, and  the
  continued  possession  by  such person of a tow truck operator's license
  would  pose  a  serious  danger  to  the  safety  of  the  public,   the
  commissioner  may  immediately  suspend  his or her tow truck operator's
  license. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, upon the suspension
  or revocation pursuant to the vehicle and traffic law of  a  license  to
  operate  a  motor  vehicle that is held by a person who also holds a tow
  truck operator's license pursuant to this subchapter,  the  commissioner
  shall  immediately  suspend  his  or  her  tow truck operator's license.
  Notice of the suspension of a tow truck operator's license  pursuant  to
  this  section  shall  be  served  on  the operator and on the person who
  employs such operator to operate a tow  truck.  The  commissioner  shall
  provide the operator with the opportunity for a hearing within five days
  after the notification of suspension, after which the commissioner shall
  forthwith  make  a  determination  as  to whether such suspension should
  continue and in addition may impose any penalty or sanction provided for
  under this subchapter, provided,  however  that  where  the  license  to
  operate  a  motor  vehicle held by a tow truck operator has been revoked
  pursuant to the vehicle and traffic law, the commissioner  shall  revoke
  such  person's  tow  truck  operator's  license  issued pursuant to this
  subchapter.
