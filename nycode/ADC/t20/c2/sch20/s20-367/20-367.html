Section 20-367

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  20-367  Places  closed  to  public  within  certain hours. Premises
  licensed hereunder shall not be kept open for business,  nor  shall  the
  public  be  permitted  to  enter or to remain therein, between four ante
  meridian and eight ante meridian; and if the occupant  is  a  membership
  corporation,  club, association, or society, its members or their guests
  shall not be permitted to enter or to remain therein between such hours.
  The commissioner, in his or her  discretion,  may  permit  any  premises
  licensed  hereunder  to  be  open  to  the  public between such hours on
  special occasions. If it appears to the commissioner that the place  for
  which  a  license is sought will be frequented by minors, or if there is
  in the opinion of the commissioner any other good and sufficient  reason
  therefor,  he  or  she  may  grant a license upon the condition that the
  licensed premises shall not  be  open  for  business  between  one  ante
  meridian and eight ante meridian.
