Section 20-369

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 20-369 Suspension and revocation of license. a. The commissioner may
  suspend  or  revoke a license for conduct of the licensee, its officers,
  principals,  directors,  agents  or  employees  or  in  a  closely  held
  corporation,  stockholders that would constitute grounds for denying the
  issuance of renewal of a license pursuant  to  section  20-361  of  this
  code.
    b.  The  commissioner  may suspend or revoke a cabaret or public dance
  hall license if  the  licensee  violates  the  requirements  of  section
  20-360.1  of  this  subchapter, provided, however, that the commissioner
  shall suspend or revoke a cabaret or public dance hall license upon  the
  third violation by the licensee within two years of the first violation.
    c. Upon application to the commissioner and prior to the reinstatement
  or  reissuance of a suspended or revoked license, the licensee, with the
  commissioner's approval, shall, upon payment of the fee as specified  in
  section 20-362 of this code, be permitted to operate for six months on a
  probationary  license.  At the end of such six month period, the license
  shall be reinstated or reissued unless the commissioner finds  that  the
  licensee,  its  officers, principals, directors, agents or employees or,
  in a closely held corporation, stockholders,  have  engaged  in  conduct
  that  would  constitute grounds for denying the issuance or renewal of a
  license pursuant to section 20-361 of this code. Upon a finding of  such
  conduct  the  probationary  license  shall  be  revoked and shall not be
  reissued for a period of one year.
