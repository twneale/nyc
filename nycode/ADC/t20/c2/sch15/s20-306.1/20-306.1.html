Section 20-306.1

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  20-306.1  Refusal  to  issue  or renew, or suspension or revocation
  based on criminal conviction. In addition to any of the powers that  may
  be  exercised by the commissioner pursuant to this subchapter or chapter
  one of this title, the commissioner, after notice and an opportunity  to
  be  heard,  may  refuse  to  issue or renew, or may suspend or revoke, a
  license required under this subchapter if the applicant or licensee,  or
  any of its principals, officers or directors, or any of its stockholders
  owning more than ten percent of the outstanding stock of the corporation
  has   been   convicted  of  a  crime  which,  in  the  judgment  of  the
  commissioner, has a direct relationship  to  such  person's  fitness  or
  ability to perform any of the activities for which a license is required
  under this subchapter or has been convicted of any other crime which, in
  accordance  with  article  twenty-three-a  of  the correction law, would
  provide a justification for the  commissioner  to  refuse  to  issue  or
  renew, or to suspend or revoke, such license.
