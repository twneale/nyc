Section 20-306

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  20-306 Proof of qualifications; fingerprinting. a. The commissioner
  shall require  any  applicant  for  a  locksmith's  license  to  furnish
  documentary  proof  that he or she is a qualified locksmith, and if such
  evidence is not satisfactory to the commissioner, the  commissioner  may
  require  the  applicant  to  submit  to  any examination by at least two
  licensed locksmiths to be named by the commissioner,  to  serve  without
  compensation,   and   such  licensed  locksmiths,  after  examining  the
  applicant shall certify in writing to the commissioner  whether  or  not
  the  applicant in their opinion is sufficiently qualified to be licensed
  as a locksmith.
    b. The commissioner shall require that applicants for licenses  issued
  pursuant to this subchapter be fingerprinted for the purpose of securing
  criminal  history  records  from  the state division of criminal justice
  services. The applicant shall pay a processing fee as  required  by  the
  state division of criminal justice services. Fingerprints shall be taken
  of  the  individual owner if the applicant is a sole proprietorship; the
  general partners if the applicant is a partnership;  and  the  officers,
  principals,  directors, and stockholders owning more than ten percent of
  the  outstanding  stock  of  the  corporation  if  the  applicant  is  a
  corporation.  Any  person  required  to be fingerprinted hereunder shall
  furnish to the department three  current  passport-size  photographs  of
  such  person.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing, the commissioner need not
  require applicants for licenses required under  this  subchapter  to  be
  fingerprinted if criminal history records concerning such applicants are
  not available from the state division of criminal justice services.
