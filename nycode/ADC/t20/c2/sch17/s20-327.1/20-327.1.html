Section 20-327.1

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 20-327.1 Bicycle parking spaces.
    a. Applicability.
    1.  i.  The  operator  of  every  garage  and  parking lot that has an
  authorized capacity of one-hundred or more motor vehicles shall  provide
  and  maintain  parking  spaces  for  bicycles  in  accordance  with  the
  provisions of this section.
    ii. Two years after the effective date of the  local  law  that  added
  this  section,  the operator of every garage and parking lot that has an
  authorized capacity of fifty-one or more motor  vehicles  shall  provide
  and  maintain  parking  spaces  for  bicycles  in  accordance  with  the
  provisions of this section.
    2. The requirements of subdivisions a through f of this section  shall
  not  apply  to  buildings  or  parking lots that comply with the bicycle
  parking provisions of sections 25-80, 36-70  and  44-60  of  the  zoning
  resolution of the city of New York.
    3.  Waiver.  The  operator  of  a garage or parking lot subject to the
  provisions of this section may apply to the commissioner  for  a  waiver
  from  the  requirements  of  this section on the grounds that compliance
  with this section will result in a  violation  of  otherwise  applicable
  zoning  regulations,  including,  but  not limited to zoning regulations
  determining the number of required automobile parking spaces a garage or
  parking lot shall have. Prior to applying for such waiver, such operator
  of a garage or parking lot shall submit to the commissioner of buildings
  a  certification  from  a  registered  design  professional  and   other
  supporting  additional  documentation  as such commissioner may require,
  including, but not limited to, floor plans and diagrams of the garage or
  parking lot in anticipation of the  waiver  application.  Upon  complete
  submission  of all required documentation, the commissioner of buildings
  shall within forty  days  review  the  documentation  submitted  by  the
  operator, and shall provide to the operator a written recommendation, of
  whether compliance would be impracticable because of the requirements of
  applicable   zoning   regulations.   The   operator  shall  submit  such
  recommendation to the commissioner as part of  its  waiver  application,
  and  the  resulting  written  grant or denial of such application by the
  commissioner shall be final.
    b. Bicycle parking spaces in garages and lots.
    1. The operator of every garage or lot subject to  the  provisions  of
  this section shall maintain: (i) racks, hooks, poles or other devices to
  which  bicycles  can be secured; and (ii) locks, chains or other devices
  with which to secure them.
    Such devices shall enable the garage or lot  to  park  and  secure  at
  least  one  bicycle for every ten automobile parking spaces provided, up
  to two hundred automobile parking spaces. Thereafter, the garage or  lot
  shall  be  equipped to park one bicycle for every one hundred automobile
  parking spaces. Fractions equal to or greater  than  one-half  resulting
  from  this  calculation  shall  be  deemed  to  require  parking for one
  bicycle. Parking garages or lots that permit customers to park and  lock
  their  bicycles  using the customers' own locks, chains or other devices
  with which to secure such bicycles shall be required to maintain  locks,
  chains  or  other  devices  with  which to secure bicycles sufficient to
  accommodate customers who do not have their own  lock,  chain  or  other
  device with which to secure their bicycles.
    2.  A  bicycle  parked  in  a  garage  or  lot  that is subject to the
  provisions of this section shall be parked at least two feet  away  from
  any motor vehicle.
    3. Bicycles parked pursuant to this section shall be locked to a rack,
  pole  or  other device capable of securing the bicycle, or shall be hung
  on the wall from a securely anchored rack or hook to which  the  bicycle

  frame  and  at  least  one  wheel shall be locked. Such requirements for
  racks, poles, or hooks and locks, chains or other securing devices shall
  not be required where a parking garage or lot provides  bicycle  parking
  in  a  location  that  prohibits  any person other than employees of the
  facility from parking or removing the bicycle from the garage or lot.
    c. Bicycle parking racks, hooks, poles or other devices used by garage
  or lot operators to secure bicycles shall be of sufficient strength  and
  design to resist vandalism and theft.
    d.  Bicycle parking shall be accessible to bicycle owners/operators to
  at least the same extent as vehicle parking  is  accessible  to  vehicle
  owners/operators.  The  operator  of  a  garage  or  lot subject to this
  section shall not refuse to provide parking for a bicycle  unless  there
  is  no  room  for  such bicycle at that time because the total number of
  bicycles required to be accommodated by paragraph one of  subdivision  b
  of this section has been met.
    e. The operator of every garage and parking lot that is subject to the
  provisions  of  this section shall file with the commissioner a schedule
  of rates showing the prices  charged  daily,  weekly,  and  monthly  for
  parking and storage of bicycles.
    f. No operator of a garage or parking lot subject to the provisions of
  this  section  shall make any charge for parking or storage of a bicycle
  in excess of the  rates  set  forth  in  the  schedule  filed  with  the
  commissioner,  unless at least sixty days prior to the effective date of
  such changed rates, such operator has filed with  the  commissioner,  in
  writing, such change in rates and has posted such changed rates on signs
  which conform with the requirements of subdivision h of this section.
    g.  The  operator  of  each  garage  or  parking  lot  subject  to the
  provisions of this  section  shall  post  conspicuously  at  the  public
  entrance  to  the  garage  or parking lot a sign composed of letters and
  figures of such size, height, width, spacing, color and  description  as
  shall  be  prescribed  by the rules of the commissioner. Such sign shall
  set forth the rate to be charged by  such  garage  or  parking  lot  for
  bicycle  parking, the hours during which such garage or parking lot will
  remain open for business and the minimum capacity of  bicycles  of  such
  garage or parking lot.
    h.  Bicycles  unclaimed after sixty days shall be considered abandoned
  property and shall become the property of the operator of the garage  or
  parking lot.
    i. Within twelve months after the effective date of the local law that
  added  this  section,  the  commissioner  shall  submit  a report to the
  council regarding the effectiveness of this local law at increasing  the
  capacity  of parking for bicycles in garages. Such report shall contain,
  among other things, the number and location of  bicycle  parking  spaces
  and rate of usage of such spaces.
