<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  20-324  Rate  schedules;  change of rates. a. Every applicant for a
  license to maintain, conduct or operate a parking lot  or  garage  shall
  file  with  the  commissioner  a  schedule  of  rates showing the prices
  charged daily, weekly, and monthly  for  parking  or  storage  of  motor
  vehicles.
    b.  Each such licensee shall post conspicuously at the public entrance
  to the garage or parking lot a sign composed of letters and  figures  of
  such  size,  height,  width,  spacing, color and description as shall be
  prescribed by the rules and regulations of the commissioner.  Such  sign
  shall  set  forth  the schedule of rates charged, the hours during which
  such garage or parking lot  will  remain  open  for  business,  and  the
  maximum capacity of such garage or parking lot. Where more than one rate
  is  charged  for  the parking or storage of a motor vehicle, the letters
  and figures designating each such rate shall be of  the  same  size  and
  dimensions.
    c.  No  licensee  shall  make  any  charge for parking or storing in a
  garage or parking lot in excess of the rates set forth in  the  schedule
  filed  with the commissioner, unless and until at least sixty days prior
  to the effective date of such changed rates,  such  licensee  has  filed
  with  the  commissioner, in writing, such change in rates and has posted
  such changed rates on signs  which  conform  with  the  requirements  of
  subdivision b hereof.
