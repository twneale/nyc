  ten  feet  in  length  nor  four  feet  in  width, except as provided in
  subdivision b of this section.
    b. Where the sidewalk in front of the premises  is  at  least  sixteen
  feet wide, such stoop line stand may extend up to ten feet in length and
  five  feet  in  width  as long as a straight, unobstructed pathway of at
  least nine and one-half feet is maintained at all times on the  sidewalk
  in  front  of  the  entire  length of the premises where such stoop line
  stand is located. Where the sidewalk in front  of  the  premises  is  at
  least twenty-one feet wide, and if the entire premises is located within
  an  M1,  M2  or  M3  zoning  district, and if a stoop line stand on such
  premises was licensed on or before  the  first  day  of  September,  two
