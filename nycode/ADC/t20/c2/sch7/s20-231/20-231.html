Section 20-231

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  20-231  Restrictions;  size.  a. No newsstand shall be within three
  feet of private property without  the  consent  of  the  owner  of  that
  property.
    b.  Items  other  than newspapers, magazines, periodicals, and prepaid
  telecommunication or transit cards  may  be  offered  for  sale  from  a
  newsstand if they are sold for less than ten dollars exclusive of taxes;
  provided,  however,  that apparel, jewelry, hair ornaments, handbags and
  video cassettes shall not be offered for sale from a newsstand and  that
  if food items are offered for sale, they must be prepackaged.
    c. No new license shall be issued under section 20-229 unless approval
  for   the   location   has   been   obtained   from  the  department  of
  transportation.
    d. 1. No license issued under section 20-229 shall be renewed  if  the
  department  of  transportation determines that the newsstand so licensed
  poses an obstruction to the free use of sidewalks by pedestrians at  the
  time of review.
    2.  On  and  after  the effective date of the local law that adds this
  paragraph two to this subdivision d of this section, a  newsstand  shall
  not be eligible for a renewal if the area of the sidewalk occupied by it
  exceeds  seventy-two  square feet or such newsstand exceeds nine feet in
  height.
    (a) On and after such date, such newsstand that was first licensed  on
  or  after the first day of August, nineteen hundred ninety-one shall not
  pose an obstruction to the free use of the sidewalks by  pedestrians  if
  the location of such newsstand does not
    (i) reduce the area maintained on the sidewalk for pedestrian movement
  below a width of nine and one-half feet.
    (ii) place the proposed newsstand within five feet of a fire hydrant.
    (iii)  create a level of service at the proposed location for the peak
  fifteen minutes of the peak hour of a pedestrian flow rate equal  to  or
  greater  than eleven people per minute per linear foot of clear path, as
  determined by the department of transportation.
    (iv) place the proposed newsstand within fifteen feet of  an  entrance
  to or exit from a subway.
    (v)  extend into the area encompassed by the extension of the property
  lines from the buildings to the curb at the intersection of two  streets
  and the area ten feet on either side of such lines.
    (vi) extend into a bus stop.
    (vii)  otherwise  create  a  hazardous condition. For purposes of this
  subparagraph, a hazardous condition shall include, but  not  be  limited
  to,  the location of a newsstand less than one foot, six inches from the
  curb, under a fire escape, within ten feet of a driveway or parking  lot
  or  within  two  feet  from  underground  access points, such as utility
  access openings, ventilation grills, or cellar doors.
    (b) On and after such date, a newsstand that was first licensed  prior
  to  the  first day of August, nineteen hundred ninety-one shall not pose
  an obstruction to the free use of the sidewalks by  pedestrians  if  the
  location of such newsstand does not
    (i) reduce the area maintained on the sidewalk for pedestrian movement
  below a width of nine and one-half feet.
    (ii) place the proposed newsstand within five feet of a fire hydrant.
    (iii)  create a level of service at the proposed location for the peak
  fifteen minutes of the peak hour of a pedestrian flow rate equal  to  or
  greater  than eleven people per minute per linear foot of clear path, as
  determined by the department of transportation.
    (iv) violate  the  restrictions  on  the  location  of  newsstands  in
  subdivision  f of this section, if such newsstand is located at the rear
  or side of a subway entrance or exit kiosk.

    (v) extend into the area encompassed by the extension of the  property
  lines from the buildings to the curb at the intersection of two streets.
    (vi)  otherwise  create  a  hazardous  condition. For purposes of this
  subparagraph, a hazardous condition shall include, but  not  be  limited
  to,  the location of a newsstand less than one foot, six inches from the
  curb, under a fire escape, within ten feet of a driveway or parking  lot
  or  within  two  feet  from  underground  access points, such as utility
  access openings, ventilation grills, or cellar doors.
    e. No newsstand shall occupy an area of more than  seventy-two  square
  feet  or  have  a  height of over nine feet. However, any newsstand that
  occupied an area of more than seventy-two square feet on the  first  day
  of  August, nineteen hundred seventy-nine may continue to operate within
  that area until the thirty-first day of July, nineteen  hundred  eighty.
  In  no  event shall there be less than a width of nine and one-half feet
  maintained on the sidewalk for pedestrian  movement.  The  provision  of
  this  section  requiring  that  no  less  than nine and one-half feet be
  maintained on the sidewalk for pedestrian movement shall  not  apply  to
  any  newsstand  which  was first licensed by the department prior to the
  first day of August, nineteen hundred seventy-nine where the person  who
  held the license for such newsstand on the first day of August, nineteen
  hundred  ninety-one  continues  to  be  the licensee for such newsstand;
  provided, however, that where a newsstand which was first licensed prior
  to  the  first  day  of  August,  nineteen   hundred   seventy-nine   is
  reconstructed   in   its   entirety   or   in  substantial  part,  which
  reconstruction was commenced on  or  after  the  first  day  of  August,
  nineteen  hundred  ninety-one,  such  newsstand shall be subject to such
  requirement that no less than nine and one-half feet  be  maintained  on
  the sidewalk for pedestrian movement.
    f. Stands at subway entrance or exit kiosks shall be maintained at the
  rear  or side of such kiosks. Where such stand is located at the rear of
  such entrance or exit it shall not be located within fifteen feet of the
  front of any other entrance or exit and shall not  be  longer  than  the
  width of the kiosk nor occupy an area of more than fifty square feet.
    g.  It shall be unlawful to erect a stand or booth under the stairs of
  an elevated railway station, or a projection therefrom, which  is  wider
  than  the  width  of  the  stairs  or which extends along the sidewalk a
  greater distance than to a point where  the  undersurface  is  not  over
  seven feet from the level of the sidewalk.
    h.   1.  After  November  first,  nineteen  hundred  seventy-nine,  no
  newsstand may be operated unless its design has been approved by the art
  commission. The art  commission  shall  evaluate  newsstand  designs  in
  conformity  with  guidelines  to  be  established  by  the department of
  consumer affairs. Approval or disapproval of a design  submission  shall
  be  issued  within  thirty  days  of  filing  an  application  with  the
  commission.
    2. The department of transportation shall  develop  criteria  for  the
  design  of  the  interior  of  newsstands constructed and installed by a
  franchisee pursuant  to  a  franchise  in  consultation  with  available
  representatives  of newsstand licensees and available representatives of
  publishers.
    i. No advertising shall be placed on any newsstand other than exterior
  advertising placed by a franchisee. Nothing herein shall be construed to
  prohibit or limit the ability of the newsstand licensee to display legal
  merchandise pursuant to rules promulgated by the department.
    j.  The  licensee  shall  make  reasonable  efforts  to  maintain  the
  cleanliness  of his or her newsstand. Such requirement shall not include
  an obligation to maintain the exterior of a structure installed pursuant

  to a franchise. The licensee shall make no alteration in the  design  or
  dimensions of a newsstand constructed or installed by a franchisee.
    k.  1.  On and after the grant of a franchise, no new license shall be
  granted except for operation of a  newsstand  installed  and  maintained
  pursuant  to  such  franchise,  and  approval  of  the location of a new
  newsstand  shall  be  made  by  the  department  of  transportation   in
  accordance with rules of the department.
    2.  Notwithstanding  any other provision of this section or the second
  undesignated paragraph of section 15-205 of the code, a  newsstand,  the
  location  or dimensions of which were not in violation of the provisions
  of this section or any rule promulgated pursuant thereto at the date  of
  the  grant  of  a franchise and which complies with all of the terms and
  conditions of such franchise, may be reconstructed at such  location  by
  such  franchisee  if such reconstruction does not change the location of
  such newsstand or expand the area occupied by  such  newsstand  for  any
  reason,  including  compliance with the requirements of any provision of
  law  in  effect  at  the  time  of  such  reconstruction,  such  as  the
  requirements   of   the   Americans   with  Disabilities  Act.  If  such
  reconstruction results in a change in location or an  expansion  of  the
  area  occupied by such newsstand, such newsstand may be reconstructed at
  such changed or expanded location if that  location  complies  with  the
  siting  criteria  applicable  to  the  renewal  of  the  license of such
  newsstand in subparagraph (a) or (b) of paragraph two of  subdivision  d
  of  this  section.  If  such  reconstruction  at such location would not
  comply with such criteria, such newsstand may be relocated in accordance
  with the process defined in paragraph five  of  this  subdivision  to  a
  location  that  meets the criteria in subparagraph (a) of such paragraph
  two.
    3. On or after the grant of such franchise, any newsstand applying for
  renewal  of  a  license  issued  pursuant  to  section  20-229  of  this
  subchapter  may  remain  at  its  then  current location if it meets the
  siting criteria applicable  to  the  renewal  of  the  license  of  such
  newsstand  in  subparagraph (a) or (b) of paragraph two of subdivision d
  of this section, or, if such location does not meet such criteria,  such
  newsstand  may  be  relocated  in accordance with the process defined in
  paragraph five of this subdivision to a location that meets the criteria
  in subparagraph (a) of such paragraph two.
    4. On or  after  the  grant  of  such  franchise,  the  department  of
  transportation  shall  not exercise its authority, by granting revocable
  consents  or  other  approvals,  to  authorize  the  installation  of  a
  structure  at  a  location  that would render the location of a licensed
  newsstand in violation of the siting criteria applicable to the  renewal
  of  licenses in subparagraph (a) or (b), as applicable to the renewal of
  the license of such newsstand, of paragraph two of subdivision d of this
  section unless the commissioner  of  such  department  finds  that  such
  installation  is  for  the  benefit of public health, safety, welfare or
  convenience. In the event the installation of a structure not prohibited
  by this paragraph four causes the location  of  a  newsstand  to  be  in
  violation  of such criteria, such newsstand may be relocated pursuant to
  the process defined in paragraph five of this subdivision to a  location
  that meets the criteria in subparagraph (a) of such paragraph two.
    5.  (a)  On  or  after the grant of such a franchise, a newsstand, the
  location of which fails to meet the siting criteria  applicable  to  the
  renewal  of  the license of such newsstand in subparagraph (a) or (b) of
  paragraph two of subdivision d of this section shall cease operation and
  shall be removed  from  such  location.  A  newsstand  required  by  the
  provisions  of  this  paragraph  to  be  relocated  at any time shall be
  eligible to be relocated to a site within a radius of five hundred  feet

  from  such  licensed  location,  referred  to  in  this  section  as the
  "catchment area", provided such site is identified by the  licensee  and
  meets  the  siting  criteria  applicable  to  the renewal of licenses in
  subparagraph  (a)  of  paragraph  two  of subdivision d of this section.
  Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of  this  subparagraph  (a)  of
  this paragraph five, a newsstand, the license for which is in full force
  and  effect,  shall  not  be  required  to  be replaced before September
  thirtieth, two thousand six, if the replacement  of  such  newsstand  is
  required  to occupy an expanded area solely because of the provisions of
  the Americans with  Disabilities  Act,  and  the  installation  of  such
  newsstand  at  such expanded location would not meet the siting criteria
  applicable  to  the  renewal  of  the  license  of  such  newsstand   in
  subparagraph (a) or (b) of such paragraph two.
    (b)  If  the  department of transportation determines that there is no
  site within such catchment area to which a newsstand may be relocated in
  accordance with subparagraph (a) of this paragraph five, the licensee of
  such newsstand may apply for a license for a new newsstand in accordance
  with the applicable provisions of this subchapter.
    6. The department of transportation shall conduct an inspection at the
  time of  the  reconstruction  and  installation  of  a  newsstand  by  a
  franchisee  in  accordance  with  paragraph  two of this subdivision. In
  addition, such department shall conduct inspections of all newsstands in
  the year two thousand eight and every six years thereafter to  determine
  whether  the  location for which each newsstand is licensed violates any
  laws, rules or regulations applicable to the review by  such  department
  of  applications  for  the renewal of licenses, notwithstanding that the
  term of such licenses is two years, and, except for determinations  made
  pursuant  to  inspections  made in accordance with such paragraph two of
  this subdivision at the time of the reconstruction and installation of a
  newsstand by a franchisee, the determination  by  such  department  that
  there is no such violation shall not be revised, except for a mistake of
  fact, by such department until such six year period has elapsed.
