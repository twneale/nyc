Section 20-239

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 20-239 Approval. A stoop line stand shall not be licensed unless the
  location  thereof has been approved by the department of transportation.
  No  license  shall  be  approved  or  renewed  if  the   department   of
  transportation determines that the stoop line stand poses an obstruction
  to the free use of sidewalks by pedestrians. Notwithstanding anything in
  this  subchapter  to  the  contrary, if the department of transportation
  determines that a stoop line stand which is  permitted  to  extend  more
  than  four  feet  in width pursuant to section 20-237 of this subchapter
  poses an obstruction to the free use of sidewalks by pedestrians  solely
  because  the  width  of  such  stoop  line  stand exceeds four feet, the
  commissioner shall approve or renew such license  at  a  width  of  four
  feet.
