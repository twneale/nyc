    4. The commissioner may require the names and residence  addresses  of
  any  employees  of  an  applicant,  in addition to any other information
  which he or she may deem advisable.
    5. Each applicant shall be over eighteen years  of  age  and  of  good

    6.  The commissioner shall require that applicants for licenses issued

  prescribed by the commissioner as sufficient to verify  the  applicant's
  compliance  with  the  requirements  specified  in  subdivision  four of
