Section 20-394.1

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 20-394.1 Right of owner to cancel. A licensee shall furnish a notice
  to  the  owner  that, in addition to any other right to revoke an offer,
  the owner may cancel a home improvement contract until midnight  of  the
  third  business  day  after  the  day  on  which the owner has signed an
  agreement or offer to  purchase  relating  to  such  contract  or  until
  midnight  of  the  third  business  day after the day on which the owner
  receives the notice of his or her  right  to  cancel,  whichever  occurs
  later.  Cancellation occurs when written notice of cancellation is given
  to the home improvement contractor. Notice of cancellation, if given  by
  mail,  shall  be  deemed  given  when  deposited  in  a mailbox properly
  addressed  and  postage  prepaid.  Notice  of  cancellation   shall   be
  sufficient if it indicates the intention of the owner not to be bound by
  such  home  improvement  contract  or offer to purchase relating to such
  contract. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this paragraph shall not  apply
  to  a  transaction  in which the owner has initiated the contact and the
  home improvement is needed to meet a bona fide emergency of  the  owner,
  and  the owner furnishes the home improvement contractor with a separate
  dated  and  signed  personal  statement  in  the   owner's   handwriting
  describing  the  situation  requiring  immediate  remedy  and  expressly
  acknowledging and waiving the  right  to  cancel  the  home  improvement
  contract within three business days.
