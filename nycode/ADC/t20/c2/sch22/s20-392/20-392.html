  application for a license.
    3. The person or  the  management  personnel  of  the  contractor  are
  untrustworthy or not of good character.
    4. The business transactions of the contractor have been or are marked
  by a practice of failure to timely perform or complete its contracts, or
  the  manipulation of assets or accounts, or by fraud or bad faith, or is
  marked by an unwholesome method or practice of solicitation of  business
  from owners.
    5. Failure to display the license as provided in this subchapter.
    6.  Failure  to comply with any demand or requirement lawfully made by
  the commissioner.
    7. When an agent or employee of a licensee has been guilty of  an  act
  of  omission,  fraud, or misrepresentation and the licensee has approved
  or had knowledge thereof.
    8. Violation of any provision  of  this  subchapter  or  any  rule  or
  regulation  adopted hereunder or for performing or attempting to perform
  any act prohibited by this subchapter.
    9. Violation of any provision of subchapters  one,  two  or  three  of
  title  twenty-six  or subchapter one of title twenty-seven of this code,
  or any rule adopted  thereunder  or  for  performing  or  attempting  to

  commissioner shall suspend or revoke the license  of  any  licensee  who
  continues  to  work  in  violation of a stop-work notice or order issued
  pursuant to section 26-118 of this code.
    b. In addition to any of the powers  that  may  be  exercised  by  the

  the commissioner, after notice and  an  opportunity  to  be  heard,  may
  refuse  to  issue or renew, or may suspend or revoke, a license required
  under this subchapter if the  applicant  or  licensee,  or  any  of  its
  principals,  officers  or  directors,  or any of its stockholders owning
  more than ten percent of the outstanding stock of  the  corporation  has
  been  convicted  of  a crime which, in the judgment of the commissioner,
  has a direct relationship to such person's fitness or ability to perform
  any of the activities  for  which  a  license  is  required  under  this
  subchapter or has been convicted of any other crime which, in accordance
  with  article  twenty-three-a  of  the  correction  law, would provide a
  justification for the commissioner to refuse to issue or  renew,  or  to
  suspend or revoke, such license.
