  standards  of  competency or experience as a prerequisite to engaging in
  such craft or profession, or any person required to be licensed pursuant
  to article six-D of the general business law to engage in  the  business
  of installing, servicing, or maintaining security or fire alarm systems,
  and  who is acting exclusively within the scope of the craft, profession
  or business for which he or she is currently licensed pursuant  to  such
