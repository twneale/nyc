Section 20-401.1

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  20-401.1  Violations  for  operating  without  a  license; seizure;
  forfeiture. a. 1. For purposes of this section, the term  "owner"  shall
  mean  an  owner  as  defined  in section one hundred twenty-eight and in
  subdivision three of section three hundred eighty-eight of  the  vehicle
  and traffic law.
    2.  For  purposes  of this section, the term "security interest" shall
  mean a security interest as defined in  subdivision  k  of  section  two
  thousand one hundred one of the vehicle and traffic law.
    3.  For purposes of this section, the term "unlicensed activity" shall
  mean the conduct of  any  activity  for  which  a  license  is  required
  pursuant  to subdivision a of section 20-387 of this subchapter, without
  such license.
    b. Any police  officer  or  authorized  officer  or  employee  of  the
  department,  upon  service  on  the  owner or operator of a vehicle of a
  notice of violation for engaging in unlicensed  activity,  may  seize  a
  vehicle  which such police officer or authorized officer or employee has
  reasonable cause to believe  is  being  used  in  connection  with  such
  violation.  Any  vehicle  seized  pursuant  to this subdivision shall be
  delivered into the  custody  of  the  department  or  other  appropriate
  agency.  The  commissioner  shall  hold  a  hearing  to  adjudicate  the
  violation underlying the seizure within five  business  days  after  the
  date  of  seizure and shall render his or her determination within three
  business days after the conclusion of the  hearing.  Such  determination
  shall  also include a finding as to whether or not such vehicle was used
  in connection with such violation.
    c. An owner may  obtain  release  of  a  vehicle  seized  pursuant  to
  subdivision  b of this section prior to the hearing provided for in such
  subdivision, if such owner has not previously been found to have engaged
  in unlicensed activity within a five-year period prior to the  violation
  resulting  in such seizure. The vehicle shall be released to an eligible
  owner upon the posting of an all cash bond in a form satisfactory to the
  commissioner in an amount sufficient to cover the maximum fines or civil
  penalties which may be imposed for the violation underlying the  seizure
  and all reasonable costs for removal and storage of such vehicle.
    d.  After adjudication of the violation underlying the seizure, if the
  commissioner finds that the vehicle has not been used in connection with
  unlicensed activity, the department shall promptly release such  vehicle
  upon written demand of its owner.
    e.  After adjudication of the violation underlying the seizure, if the
  commissioner finds that the vehicle has been  used  in  connection  with
  unlicensed  activity  then:  (i)  if  the  vehicle  is  not  subject  to
  forfeiture pursuant to paragraph one of subdivision g of  this  section,
  the  department  shall  release such vehicle to an owner upon payment of
  all applicable fines and civil penalties and  all  reasonable  costs  of
  removal  and  storage;  or  (ii) if the vehicle is subject to forfeiture
  pursuant to  paragraph  one  of  subdivision  g  of  this  section,  the
  department  may  release  such  vehicle  to an owner upon payment of all
  applicable fines and civil penalties and all reasonable costs of removal
  and storage, or may commence a forfeiture action within ten  days  after
  the owner's written demand for such vehicle.
    f.  Any vehicle that has not been claimed by the owner within ten days
  after adjudication by the commissioner of the violation  underlying  the
  seizure  shall be deemed by the department to be abandoned. Such vehicle
  shall be disposed of  by  the  department  pursuant  to  section  twelve
  hundred twenty-four of the vehicle and traffic law.
    g.  1. In addition to any other fine, penalty or sanction provided for
  in section 20-401 of this code, a vehicle seized pursuant to subdivision
  b of this section, and all rights, title and interest therein  shall  be

  subject to forfeiture to the city upon notice and judicial determination
  thereof  if the owner of such vehicle has been found liable at least two
  times within a five-year period for engaging in unlicensed activity, and
  each  of  those determinations have included findings that a vehicle was
  used in connection with such violations.
    2. A forfeiture action pursuant to this subdivision shall be commenced
  by the filing of a summons with a notice or a summons and  complaint  in
  accordance  with  the  civil  practice  law and rules. Such summons with
  notice or a summons and complaint shall be served in accordance with the
  civil practice law and rules on all owners of the subject vehicle listed
  in the records maintained by the department of motor  vehicles,  or  for
  vehicles  not  registered  in  the  state  of  New  York, in the records
  maintained by the state of registration. A vehicle which is the  subject
  of  such  action  shall remain in the custody of the department or other
  appropriate agency pending the final  determination  of  the  forfeiture
  action.
    3.  Notice  of the institution of the forfeiture action shall be given
  by first-class mail to all persons holding a security interest  in  such
  vehicle, if such security interest has been filed with the department of
  motor  vehicles  pursuant  to the provisions of title ten of the vehicle
  and traffic law, at the  address  set  forth  in  the  records  of  such
  department, or for vehicles not registered in the state of New York, all
  persons  holding  a  security  interest in such vehicle if such security
  interest has been filed with the state of registration and which persons
  are made known by such state to the department, at the address  provided
  by such state of registration.
    4.  Any  owner  who receives notice of the institution of a forfeiture
  action who claims an interest in the vehicle subject to  forfeiture  may
  assert  a  claim  in  such  action  for  the  recovery of the vehicle or
  satisfaction of the owner's interest in such vehicle. Any person with  a
  security interest in such vehicle who receives notice of the institution
  of  the forfeiture action who claims an interest in such vehicle subject
  to forfeiture may assert a claim in such action for satisfaction of such
  person's security interest in such vehicle.
    5. Forfeiture pursuant to this subdivision shall be  made  subject  to
  the  interest of a person who claims an interest in the vehicle pursuant
  to paragraph four of this subdivision,  where  such  person  establishes
  that:  (i) the use of the vehicle for the conduct that was the basis for
  the seizure of the  vehicle  occurred  without  the  knowledge  of  such
  person,  or  if  such person had knowledge of such use, that such person
  did not consent to such use by doing all that could reasonably have been
  done to prevent such use, and that such person did not knowingly  obtain
  such  interest  in  the vehicle in order to avoid the forfeiture of such
  vehicle, or (ii) that the conduct that was the basis  for  such  seizure
  was  committed by any person other than such person claiming an interest
  in the vehicle, while such vehicle was unlawfully in the possession of a
  person who acquired possession thereof in violation of the criminal laws
  of the United States or any state.
    6. The department or agency  having  custody  of  the  vehicle,  after
  judicial  determination  of forfeiture, shall, at its discretion, either
  (i) retain such vehicle for the official use of the  city;  or  (ii)  by
  public  notice  of  at  least  five days, sell such forfeited vehicle at
  public sale. The net proceeds of any such sale shall be  paid  into  the
  general fund of the city.
    7.  In  any  forfeiture action commenced pursuant to this subdivision,
  where the court awards a  sum  of  money  to  one  or  more  persons  in
  satisfaction  of  such  person's  interest in the forfeited vehicle, the
  total amount awarded to satisfy such interest  or  interests  shall  not

  exceed  the  amount  of  the  net  proceeds of the sale of the forfeited
  vehicle after deduction of the lawful expenses  incurred  by  the  city,
  including reasonable costs of removal and storage of the vehicle between
  the time of seizure and the date of sale.
