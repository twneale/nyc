Section 20-250

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  20-250  Pedicab  business  license.  a.  It shall be unlawful for a
  pedicab owner to conduct a pedicab business unless  such  pedicab  owner
  shall  have  first  obtained  from  the  commissioner a pedicab business
  license.
    b. In order to obtain, amend or renew a pedicab  business  license,  a
  pedicab owner must provide the commissioner with the following:
    1.  A list of all pedicabs owned, leased or controlled by such pedicab
  owner for which  such  owner  seeks  registration  pursuant  to  section
  20-255. Each such pedicab shall be uniquely identified on such list;
    2.  Proof that there is in force for the full license term a policy of
  public  liability  and  property  damage  insurance   that   meets   the
  requirements  of  section  20-253  of  this  subchapter for each pedicab
  listed pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision; and
    3. Such other information as the commissioner may require to establish
  the pedicab owner's eligibility for a  pedicab  business  license  under
  this subchapter.
    c.  A  pedicab business license shall be valid for a term of one year,
  except that business licenses issued prior to  November  1,  2010  shall
  expire  on November 1, 2010. There shall be an annual fee of one hundred
  and ten dollars  for  such  license  that  shall  include  the  fee  for
  registration,   required   by   section  20-255,  of  one  pedicab.  The
  registration fee for each additional pedicab shall be sixty dollars. The
  annual fee may be pro-rated by the commissioner for the initial  license
  period.
    d.  Notwithstanding  subdivision a of this section, a person holding a
  pedicab driver license  shall  not  be  required  to  obtain  a  pedicab
  business  license to drive a pedicab that is owned by a pedicab business
  licensed under this subchapter.
    e. The commissioner shall have the  authority  to  deny  or  revoke  a
  pedicab  business  license  if  a  pedicab  owner  fails  to  obtain the
  registration  plates  required  pursuant  to  section  20-255  for   the
  pedicab(s)  identified  on  the list submitted by such owner pursuant to
  paragraph 1 of subdivision b of this section.
