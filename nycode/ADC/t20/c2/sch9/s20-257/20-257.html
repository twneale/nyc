Section 20-257

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 20-257 Pedicab driver license. a. It shall be unlawful for a pedicab
  driver  to  operate a pedicab unless the pedicab driver shall have first
  obtained a pedicab driver license from the commissioner.
    b. It shall be unlawful for a pedicab business to permit the operation
  of any pedicabs owned by it by a person who  does  not  have  a  pedicab
  driver  license  and  a motor vehicle driver's license in full force and
  effect.
    c. In order to obtain or renew a pedicab  driver  license,  a  pedicab
  driver  shall file an application with the commissioner for such pedicab
  driver license. Such  application  shall  be  made  upon  such  form  as
  prescribed by the commissioner and shall contain such information as the
  commissioner  may require to establish the applicant's eligibility for a
  pedicab driver license under this subchapter.
    d. To be eligible for or to maintain  a  pedicab  driver  license,  an
  applicant or licensee shall:
    1. be at least eighteen years of age;
    2. possess a currently valid motor vehicle driver's license that is in
  full force and effect;
    3.  not  have  his  or her motor vehicle driver's license suspended or
  revoked; and
    4. meet such fitness requirements as the commissioner may determine by
  rule.
    e. A pedicab driver license shall be valid for a  term  of  one  year.
  There  shall  be  a  fee  of  thirty-five  dollars for such license. The
  commissioner shall establish the expiration date  for  such  license  by
  rule.
    f. The commissioner may refuse to issue a pedicab driver license or to
  renew such a license based upon a determination that such pedicab driver
  has engaged in conduct which would constitute a basis for the suspension
  or  revocation of a pedicab driver license as set forth in subdivision c
  of section 20-261 of this subchapter.
    g. Service of a violation, and  any  related  notices,  on  a  pedicab
  driver  shall constitute service on the pedicab business that authorized
  the operation of such pedicab by virtue of  employment,  lease,  or  any
  other  arrangement and shall afford the pedicab business the opportunity
  to participate in any hearing held on such violation.
