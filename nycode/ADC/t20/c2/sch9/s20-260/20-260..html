  business  name,  address,  telephone number and pedicab business license
  number; and (iii) the rate per ride as indicated on the exterior of  the
  pedicab  and  the  rear  of  the  bike  seat  of the pedicab pursuant to
  paragraphs 14 and  15  of  subdivision  a  of  section  20-254  of  this
  subchapter.  At  the  conclusion  of  the pedicab ride, the driver shall
