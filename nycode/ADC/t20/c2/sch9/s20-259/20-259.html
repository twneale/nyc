<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  20-259  Restrictions  on  the  operation  of pedicabs. a. A pedicab
  driver shall be subject  to  all  provisions  of  state  and  local  law
  governing the operation of a bicycle, which include, but are not limited
  to,  provisions  of  the  vehicle  and  traffic  law,  the New York city
  administrative code, and rules of the city of New  York  promulgated  by
  the  department  of  transportation  and  the  department  of  parks and
  recreation.
    b. A pedicab driver shall not:
    1. operate a pedicab to transport more than three passengers.
    2. operate a pedicab in motion while a passenger is standing  in  such
  pedicab.
    3.  operate a pedicab on any bridge or in any tunnel or in any bicycle
  lane, or within any pedestrian  plaza.  For  purposes  of  this  section
  "pedestrian  plaza"  shall  mean an area designated by the New York city
  department of transportation for use by pedestrians located fully within
  the bed of a roadway, which may vary in  size  and  shape;  may  abut  a
  sidewalk;  may  be  at the same level as the roadway or raised above the
  level of the roadway; may be physically separated from  the  roadway  by
  curbing,  bollards,  or  other  barrier;  may  be  treated  with special
  markings and  materials;  and  may  contain  benches,  tables  or  other
  facilities for pedestrian use.
    4.  permit  a  pedicab  to  be  operated  simultaneously  by anyone in
  addition to him or herself.
    5. operate a  pedicab  that  is  designed  or  constructed  to  permit

    6.  operate  a  pedicab while such pedicab driver's ability to operate
  such pedicab is impaired by the consumption of alcohol, the use  of  any
  drug  or  by  any  other  means  or  while  such pedicab driver is in an
  intoxicated condition. A pedicab driver operating a  pedicab  which  has
  been  involved  in  an  accident  or  has  been operated in violation of
  subdivision a of this section shall be deemed to have given consent to a
  breath test and shall, at the request of a police officer, submit  to  a
  breath  test to be administered by the police officer. Failure to submit
  to such breath test shall serve as the basis for an immediate suspension
  of the pedicab driver's license, subject  to  a  prompt  post-suspension
  hearing.
    7.  operate a pedicab without a currently valid motor vehicle driver's
  license or while such pedicab driver's  New  York  State  motor  vehicle
  driver's license is suspended or revoked.
    c.  Pedicabs  can  be  operated within any public park or any property
  under the charge or control of the department of  parks  and  recreation

  accordance with the rules of the department of transportation.
    d. A pedicab business shall submit to the department, upon  such  form
  prescribed  by  the  commissioner,  a  written  report of every accident
  relating to a pedicab by such pedicab business within twenty-four  hours
  after  the  occurrence  of such accident. Such form shall be signed by a
  principal or officer of such pedicab business as well as by the  pedicab
  driver involved in such accident with an affirmation of the truth of the
  contents of the form.
    e.  If  there  are exigent circumstances and a police officer or other
  authorized officer or employee of any  city  agency  directs  a  pedicab
  driver  to  move  his  or  her  pedicab from any street, avenue or other
  location, such pedicab driver shall not operate his or  her  pedicab  at
  such  street,  avenue  or  location  for  the  duration  of such exigent
  circumstances.
    1. For the purposes of this subdivision, exigent  circumstances  shall
  include,  but not be limited to, unusually heavy pedestrian or vehicular

  traffic, existence of any obstructions in the public space, an accident,
  fire or other emergency, a parade, demonstration or other such event  at
  or near such location.
    f. If there are exceptional circumstances, the police commissioner, in
  consultation  with  the  commissioners  of  the  departments of consumer
  affairs  and  transportation,  shall  be  authorized,  upon  notice,  to
  restrict  or  prohibit  any  pedicab  driver  from  operating his or her
  pedicab on any street, avenue or other location for a  specified  period
  of  time.  Such  specified period of time shall not exceed fourteen days
  except, during the period  that  commences  November  12  and  concludes
  January  7  of  the  following year, in and around the area of Manhattan
  bound on the north by Fifty-ninth Street, on the south  by  Thirty-ninth
  Street,  on  the  east  by  Lexington  Avenue  and on the west by Eighth

  vehicular traffic, existence of any obstructions in the public space,  a
  parade,  demonstration or other such event or occurrence at or near such
  location.
    g. Every affected community board  may,  at  any  time  subsequent  to
  enactment  of  this local law, conduct public hearings hereon and submit
  written recommendations to  the  department  of  consumer  affairs,  the
  department  of  transportation,  the  police department and the council.
  Such recommendations may include, but not  be  limited  to,  methods  to
  address  any  impact this law may have on such community with respect to
  pedestrian and vehicle traffic flow.
    h.  A  pedicab  business  shall  design  and  implement  policies  and
  procedures  to train all pedicab drivers that operate any pedicabs owned
  by such pedicab business of the obligation to follow all  provisions  of
  state  and  local law governing the operation of a bicycle, as described
  in subdivision a of this section, and  shall  require  such  drivers  to
  provide  a copy of any summons, complaint, or notice of violation of any
  law or regulation received while operating a  pedicab  to  such  pedicab
  business,  as  well  as  a  copy  of  the  disposition  of such summons,
  complaint or notice of violation of such pedicab business,  within  five
  business  days  of  such drivers' receipt of such documents. It shall be
  unlawful for a pedicab business to fail  to  train  pedicab  drivers  to
  ensure compliance with such requirements.
    i.  A  pedicab  driver  who  is arrested, or who receives a summons or
  complaint for a traffic-related offense or other notice of violation  of
  any  law  or regulation, while operating a pedicab, shall provide a copy
  of the record of such arrest or a copy of  such  summons,  complaint  or
  notice  of  violation  to  the pedicab business to which such pedicab is
  registered within five business days of such driver's  receipt  of  such
  documents. A pedicab driver shall also provide a copy of the disposition
  of  such  arrest,  summons,  complaint,  or  notice of violation to such
  pedicab business within five days of receipt  of  such  disposition.  It
  shall  be  unlawful for a pedicab driver to fail to provide any of these
  documents to the pedicab business.
