  operation of a pedicab business.
    b.  Notwithstanding subdivision a of this section, upon the occurrence
  of any of the conditions set forth in subdivision a, if the commissioner
  determines that continued possession by a pedicab  owner  of  a  pedicab
  business  license  would  pose  an  exigent  danger  to  the public, the
  commissioner may suspend such pedicab business  license,  subject  to  a
  prompt post-suspension hearing.
    c.  In  addition  to  any  of  the powers that may be exercised by the
  commissioner pursuant to this subchapter or chapter one of  this  title,
  the  commissioner,  after due notice and an opportunity to be heard, may

  one or more of the following conditions:
    1.  the  occurrence  of  fraud, misrepresentation, or false statements
  contained in the application for such license;

  to the operation of a pedicab by such pedicab driver.
    d. Notwithstanding subdivision c of this section, upon the  occurrence
  of  any of the provisions set forth in subdivision c of this section, if
  the commissioner determines  that  continued  possession  by  a  pedicab
  driver  of  a pedicab driver license would pose an exigent danger to the
  public, the  commissioner  may  suspend  such  pedicab  driver  license,
  subject to a prompt post-suspension hearing.
    e. 1. Any pedicab driver who has been found to have committed:
    (i)  one  violation  of paragraph 7 of subdivision b of section 20-259

  commissioner  pursuant  to  this subchapter, the commissioner, after due
  notice and an opportunity to be heard,  may  suspend,  revoke,  deny  or
