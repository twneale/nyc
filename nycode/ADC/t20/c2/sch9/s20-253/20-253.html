Section 20-253

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  20-253  Insurance. a. It shall be unlawful for any pedicab business
  to operate or authorize the operation  of  a  pedicab  within  the  city
  unless  there  is  in  force for such pedicab a policy of insurance that
  meets the requirements of this section.
    b. Such policy  of  liability  insurance  shall  insure  such  pedicab
  business  and  all  pedicab  drivers  of  the pedicabs of such business,
  whether such pedicab drivers are employees of the  pedicab  business  or
  operate  such pedicabs otherwise by agreement with the pedicab business.
  Such  insurance  policy  must  provide,  at   minimum,   the   following
  protection:
    1.  The pedicab business carries a policy providing liability coverage
  for injury or  death  of  any  person  or  persons,  and  damage  to  or
  destruction  of  any  property  in a combined single limit amount of two
  million dollars, or such higher amount as the commissioner may determine
  pursuant to rule, with  a  maximum  of  one  million  dollars  for  each
  accident,  where  liability  for  such  injury  or  death of a person or
  persons, or damage to or destruction of property shall arise out of  the
  operation of the pedicab business's pedicabs; or
    2.  Each  pedicab is insured in at least the following amounts, unless
  the commissioner establishes higher  amounts  pursuant  to  rule,  where
  liability  for such injury or death of a person or persons, or damage to
  or destruction of property shall arise  out  of  the  operation  of  the
  pedicab:
    (i)  for  personal injury or death to one person, one hundred thousand
  dollars;
    (ii) for personal injury or death to  all  persons  in  one  accident,
  three  hundred  thousand dollars, with a maximum of one hundred thousand
  dollars for each person; and
    (iii) for property damage, fifty thousand dollars.
    c. Such policy of liability insurance shall name the city of New  York
  as an insured party.
    d.   The  pedicab  business  shall  notify  the  commissioner  of  any
  modification, amendment, cancellation or substitution of  any  insurance
  policy required under subdivision b of this section within fourteen days
  of  the date of the notice to the pedicab business of such modification,
  amendment, cancellation or substitution.
    e. If the policy of insurance required by this section lapses for  any
  reason,  the license issued pursuant to section 20-250 shall become void
  for such pedicab business.
