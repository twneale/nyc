Section 20-255

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 20-255 Inspection; registration plate.
    a. It shall be unlawful for a pedicab business to operate or authorize
  the operation of, or for a pedicab driver to operate, a pedicab unless:
    1. it has been inspected by the department;
    2.  it  has  been  issued  a registration plate that indicates on such
  plate the expiration date of the current registration; and
    3. such registration is in effect.
    b. The registration shall be valid for a period  no  longer  than  one
  year  and the expiration date of such registration plate shall be a date
  specified by the commissioner by rule,  except  that  the  registrations
  issued prior to November 1, 2010 shall expire on November 1, 2010.
    c. If the commissioner determines after such inspection that a pedicab
  is  equipped  with  the  features  set forth in subdivision a of section
  20-254, and complies with the requirement set forth in subdivision b  of
  section 20-254, upon payment of the registration fee provided by section
  20-250  of  this  subchapter,  the department shall issue a registration
  plate to the pedicab business that  authorized  the  operation  of  such
  pedicab.
    d. Such registration plate shall be securely affixed by the department
  to a conspicuous and indispensable part of each pedicab.
    e.  The registration plate shall be of such material, form, design and
  dimension  and  set  forth   such   distinguishing   number   or   other
  identification marks as the commissioner shall prescribe.
    f.  A  pedicab  business shall pay an additional fifty-five dollars as
  the re-inspection fee for  any  pedicab  that  fails  to  appear  at  an
  inspection  scheduled  by  the  department  or  that  is determined upon
  inspection not to  meet  the  requirements  of  this  section  and  such
  business  re-applies  for  a  registration plate. The commissioner shall
  also have the authority  to  determine  the  circumstances  under  which
  reinspections of pedicabs shall be permitted.
    g.  It shall be unlawful for a person to whom a registration plate has
  been issued to transfer any interest in such plate to any  other  person
  unless:
    1.  the  pedicab,  if intended to be transferred with the registration
  plate,  complies  with  all  applicable  requirements  imposed  by  this
  subchapter;
    2.  such  transfer  will not result in a violation of subdivision d of
  section 20-251; and
    3. the commissioner approves such transfer.
