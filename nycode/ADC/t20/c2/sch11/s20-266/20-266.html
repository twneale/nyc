  general  license  shall  furnish  a  bond  to  the city, with sufficient
  surety, to be approved by the commissioner  in  the  penal  sum  of  one
  thousand  dollars conditioned for the due observance of the law relating
  to such dealers.
    b. The fee for licenses shall be as follows: for a general license,  a
  biennial   fee  of  three  hundred  forty  dollars;  for  a  second-hand
  automobile dealer's license, a biennial fee of six hundred dollars.
    c. The commissioner shall require that applicants for licenses  issued
  pursuant to this subchapter be fingerprinted for the purpose of securing
  criminal  history  records  from  the state division of criminal justice
  services. The applicant shall pay a processing fee as  required  by  the
  state division of criminal justice services. Fingerprints shall be taken
  of  the  individual owner if the applicant is a sole proprietorship; the
  general partners if the applicant is a partnership;  and  the  officers,
  principals,  directors, and stockholders owning more than ten percent of
  the  outstanding  stock  of  the  corporation  if  the  applicant  is  a
  corporation.  Any  person  required  to be fingerprinted hereunder shall
  furnish to the department three  current  passport-size  photographs  of
  such  person.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing, the commissioner need not
  require applicants for licenses required under  this  subchapter  to  be
  fingerprinted if criminal history records concerning such applicants are
  not available from the state division of criminal justice services.
