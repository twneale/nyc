  second-hand articles to carry on his or her business at any place  other
  than the one designated in such license.
    b.  It  shall  be  unlawful  for  any  such  dealer  to  purchase  any
  second-hand goods, or things from any person whom he or she knows to  be
  or has reason to believe is a minor.
    c.  It  shall  be  unlawful for any person whose principal business is
  dealing in second-hand articles to purchase  any  second-hand  goods  or
  articles from any person between the hours of 12:00 A.M. and 6:00 A.M.
    d.  It shall be unlawful for any such dealer to sell or dispose of any
  articles  or  things  except  household  furniture,  curtains,  carpets,
  stoves, kitchen utensils, office furniture, automobiles, motor and other
  vehicles,  machinery,  belting, building materials and barrels, or other
  articles or things received from a dealer or pawnbroker, or  which  have
  been  received  from  persons  known  to  be  jewelers, dealers, banking
  institutions, executors  or  administrators,  until  the  expiration  of
  fifteen days after such purchase or redemption.
    e.  All  second-hand  articles  or things purchased for the purpose of
  melting or refining by persons principally  engaged  in  such  business,
  from persons who are not jewelers or dealers, shall not be sold, refined
  or melted or disposed of until the expiration of fifteen days after such
  purchase.
    Such  items  as  described in the preceding paragraph shall be kept on
  the premises described in the  license  which  is  required  by  section
  20-265 of this chapter.
    f.  It  shall  be  unlawful  for  any  person  licensed as a dealer in
  second-hand articles, to be  licensed  as  a  pawnbroker.  It  shall  be
  unlawful  for any such dealer to receive any article by way of pledge or
  pawn, or employ subterfuge for  receiving  goods  as  security  for  the
  advancement  of  money;  nor  shall  any  sign,  device or subterfuge be
  displayed, used or employed by any such dealer in or about the  premises
  where  such business is conducted, which in any way resembles the emblem
  or sign commonly used by pawnbrokers, or which is intended to  give  the
  appearance  that  the  business  conducted  on  such  premises is, or is
  connected with, the business of a pawnbroker; nor  shall  there  be  any
  sign displayed which is calculated to deceive.
    g.  (1)  All  open  lots used as places of storage by junk dealers and
  dealers in second-hand articles, except lots used as places  of  display
  by  dealers  engaged  exclusively  in  the  sale  of used or second-hand
  automobiles, shall be enclosed on all sides adjoining any  street  by  a
  sheet  metal  or  wooden fence which shall be sufficient to obscure such
  premises from the public view, and at least six feet in height. It shall
  be unlawful for such dealer to  display  or  exhibit  such  property  or
  articles  on or in front of any such fence. It shall be the duty of such
  dealer occupying such premises to keep such fence free and clear of  all
  signs,  posters,  handbills  or other forms of advertisement of any sort
  whatsoever, except that such dealer may display one sign  not  exceeding
  twenty-four  feet  in length by six feet in height on such fence on each
  street which such premises shall adjoin, such sign to be  used  for  the
  purpose   of   advertising   the  business  of  such  dealer.  The  same
  restrictions shall apply to the owner of such premises in the event that
  such premises are made available for lease by such owner.
    (2) It shall be unlawful to stack or to permit  the  stacking  of  any
  motor  vehicles  of  any  kind,  or  any parts thereof, upon any private
  property within the city unless  such  vehicles  or  parts  thereof  are
  completely enclosed within a building, or within an area surrounded by a
  six  foot high fence constructed of sheet metal or wood. When stacked in
  an open lot such motor  vehicles  or  parts  thereof  shall  be  on  the

  interior  portion  of  the  lot  and  the  base of such stack shall be a
  distance of not less than twenty feet from such fence, and the height of
  such stack shall not exceed twenty feet. There shall be no less  than  a
  five  hundred  foot  distance  between the area so used and any place of
  worship, school or other public building.
    (3) The commissioner shall cause periodic inspection to be made of the
  area and must be satisfied that such premises comply with all  laws  and
  rules   and  regulations  of  the  department  of  buildings,  the  fire
  department, the department of transportation, the department  of  health
  and  mental  hygiene,  and  the  department  of environmental protection
  insofar as the same are applicable thereto. For purposes of facilitating
  the  inspection  prescribed  by  this  section,  the   commissioner   is
  authorized  to  call  upon  the heads of the above named departments and
  such departments and their employees shall make such inspections as  may
  be required.
