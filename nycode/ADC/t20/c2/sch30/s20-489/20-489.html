  the public service law, acting for such utility;
    (7)  any  person  collecting or attempting to collect any debt owed or

  (i)  is  incidental  to  a bona fide fiduciary obligation or a bona fide
  escrow agreement; (ii) concerns a debt  which  was  originated  by  such
  person;  (iii)  concerns  a debt which was not in default at the time it
  was obtained by such person as a secured party in  a  commercial  credit
  transaction involving the creditor;
    (8) any officer or employee of the United States, any state thereof or
