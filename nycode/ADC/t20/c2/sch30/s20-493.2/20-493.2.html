<pre>
    
 
    20-493.2 Prohibited collection practices. In addition to any practices
  prohibited  under  any  federal,  state  or local law, a debt collection
  agency shall not:
    a. Attempt to collect or contact a consumer  regarding  a  debt  after
  such  consumer  requests  verification  for  such debt until such agency
  furnishes such consumer written documentation identifying  the  creditor
  who  originated the debt and itemizing the principal balance of the debt
  that remains or is alleged to remain due and all other charges that  are
  due or alleged to be due;
    b.  Contact  a  consumer  about or seek to collect a debt on which the
  statute of limitations for initiating legal action  has  expired  unless
  such  agency  first  provides  the  consumer  such information about the
  consumer's legal rights as the commissioner prescribes by rule.
