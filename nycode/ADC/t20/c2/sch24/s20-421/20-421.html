Section 20-421

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  20-421 Informal adjustment of complaints. 1. The commissioner shall
  receive complaints from the public against any person issued  a  license
  pursuant to this subchapter.
    2. The commissioner shall make a summary investigation of the facts.
    3.  After  investigation,  the commissioner may advise the licensee of
  the contents of the complaint and  may  recommend  measures  that  would
  compensate  the  complainant for any damages suffered as a result of the
  conduct of the licensee or  make  recommendations  which  otherwise  may
  reasonably  dispose  of  the  complaint.  If  the  licensee  accepts the
  commissioner's recommendations and performs accordingly, such fact shall
  be given due consideration in any  subsequent  disciplinary  proceedings
  instituted  by  the commissioner. If the licensee declines to accept the
  recommendations of the commissioner  and  to  perform  accordingly,  the
  commissioner  may  investigate  further  or may institute a departmental
  hearing with respect to the complaint, and may  thereafter  require  the
  licensee to make proper restitution to the complainant and may also take
  such disciplinary action as provided in this subchapter.
    4. If the licensee accepts the recommendations of the commissioner and
  is willing to perform accordingly, but the complainant refuses to accept
  such  recommendations,  the  commissioner  shall not be required to take
  further action with respect to the complaint.
