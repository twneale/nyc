  Within seven days after  the  conclusion  of  any  license  period,  the

  were in charge thereof, and when applicable the authorized  organization
  which rented its premises therefor, shall each furnish to the department
  a  statement  subscribed  by the member in charge and affirmed by him or
  her as true, under the penalties of perjury, showing the amount  of  the
  gross  receipts  derived therefrom and each item of expense incurred, or
  paid, and each item of expenditure made or to be made other than prizes,
  the name and address of each person to whom each such  item  of  expense
  has  been  paid,  or  is  to be paid, with a detailed description of the
  merchandise  purchased  or  the  services  rendered  therefor,  the  net
  proceeds  derived  from  the  conduct of the games of chance during such
  license period, and the use to which such proceeds have been or  are  to
  be  applied  and a list of prizes offered and given, with the respective
  values thereof, and it shall be the duty of each  licensee  to  maintain
  and  keep such books and records as may be necessary to substantiate the
  particulars of each such statement.
    2. Upon the filing of  such  statement  of  receipts,  the  authorized
  organization  furnishing the same shall pay to the department as and for
  an additional license fee a sum based upon the reported net proceeds, if
  any, for the license period covered by such statement and determined  in
  accordance  with such schedule as shall be established from time to time
  by the board to defray the actual cost to the city of administering  the
  provisions of this subchapter, but such additional license fee shall not
  exceed five percent of the net proceeds for such occasion.
