Section 27-112

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-112  Change in occupancy or use. Changes in the occupancy or use
  of any building may be made after  the  effective  date  of  this  code,
  subject  to  the  provisions  of section 27-217 of article twenty-two of
  this subchapter. After a change in occupancy or use has been made  in  a
  building,  the  re-establishment  of a prior occupancy or use that would
  not be lawful in a new building of the same construction class shall  be
  prohibited  unless  and until all the applicable provisions of this code
  and other  applicable  laws  and  regulations  for  such  re-established
  occupancy  or  use  shall  have  been complied with. A change from a use
  prohibited by the provisions of this code, but which was permitted prior
  to the effective date of this code, to another  use  prohibited  by  the
  provisions of this code shall be deemed a violation of this code.
