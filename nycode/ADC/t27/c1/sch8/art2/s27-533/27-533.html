Section 27-533

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 27-533 Travel distance. At least one exit opening shall be available
  from  every attached seat or standee space in an assembly space, or from
  the most remote point in the space when movable seats are  provided  or,
  when   no  seats  are  provided,  within  the  primary  travel  distance
  limitation listed in table 8-1. In addition, an alternate  exit  opening
  shall  be  available  from every attached seat or standee space, or from
  the most remote point when attached seats are not  provided  within  the
  secondary travel distance limitation listed in table 8-1. Such alternate
  exit  openings  may serve to satisfy the requirements for primary travel
  distance for other seats or  locations.  Exit  openings  satisfying  the
  primary  and  secondary travel distance requirements for any one seat or
  location shall be separated from each other by a distance  of  at  least
  twenty-five feet.
    (a)  Travel  distance shall be the measured distance along centerlines
  of paths of travel to the centerline of the exit opening, as adjusted by
  penalties for multi-directional or stepped travel as provided below.
    (1) No path of travel shall be permitted through rows of seating other
  than the first leg of travel from a seat to an aisle.
    (2) The first thirty-five feet of a  primary  path  of  travel  and  a
  secondary  path  of  travel may be common to each other except that this
  distance may be increased to fifty feet in F-2 places of assembly.
    (3) Not more than three  changes  in  direction  of  travel  shall  be
  permitted  in  the  path  of  travel  to  an  exit  opening. A change in
  direction shall be deemed to  occur  when  it  is  necessary  to  change
  direction  by  a  forty-five degrees or greater angle, measured from the
  preceding line of travel, except that it shall not be  considered  as  a
  change  in  direction when it is necessary in an aisle or cross aisle to
  travel in another direction not more than seven feet.
    (4) Travel distance shall be the sum of the distances of all  segments
  of travel to the exit, computed as follows:
 
            Segment                           Length
    First leg of travel                  Measured distance
    Second leg of travel after first     Measured distance
      change in direction
    Third leg of travel after second     1.25 times measured distance
      change in direction
    Fourth leg of travel after third     1.40 times measured distance
      change in direction
    Any leg of travel with four or       1.25 times length of segment as
      more steps                           computed above
