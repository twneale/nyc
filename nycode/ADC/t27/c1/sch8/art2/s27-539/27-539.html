  shall be adequate in width  and  area  to  accommodate  the  accumulated
  occupant  load  of  all  exits discharging into them on the basis of two
  square feet per person.
    (b) Minimum dimensions. The minimum dimensions of open exterior spaces
  shall be twenty feet, except that when the  principal  entrance  to  the
  place  of assembly is from an open exterior space, the minimum dimension
  of this space shall be thirty feet. No open exterior  space  shall  have
  less  than  four hundred square feet of floor area, and floor area shall
  be measured exclusive of the following:
    1. The area immediately outside  any  exit  door  from  the  place  of
  assembly  for a distance perpendicular to the exit doors of ten feet for
  the full width of the exit opening.
    2. The area of steps, platforms, stairs, or ramps within or leading to
  or from the space.
    3. The area of obstructions such as shrubs,  trees,  fixed  furniture,
  signs,  sculptures, pools, and similar obstructions to occupancy or exit
  travel.
    (c) Above or below grade. When an open exterior  space  is  more  than
  fifteen  feet  above or below the grade of the street or public space to
  which it discharges, its required area shall be increased by one-third.
    (d) Egress from  open  exterior  spaces.  Exterior  exit  passageways,
  ramps,  or  steps leading from open exterior spaces shall be not less in
  width than required for the occupant load of all exits discharging  into
  the  open  exterior  space.  The width of such exit passageways shall be
  based on the capacities listed in table 8-1, but in no  case  less  than
  ten  feet.    Ramps  and  steps  shall  comply  with the requirements of
  paragraph e of subdivision five of section 27-535 of this article.
