Section 27-535

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 27-535 Safe areas. Safe areas shall comply with the following:
    When provided to serve class one or class two exit openings safe areas
  shall  be  separated from assembly spaces by noncombustible construction
  having a two hour fire-resistance rating, and shall serve as  transition
  areas  in  the  line  and direction of exit travel. They shall serve for
  normal entry to the  assembly  space  and  may  be  used  as  corridors,
  lobbies,  or  lounges. No room or space classified in occupancy group A,
  B-1, D-1, or D-2 shall open upon a safe area. Safe areas shall be  at  a
  level not more than six feet above or below the level at which egress is
  made from the assembly space, except that a separate safe area shall not
  be  required for any assembly space having an occupant load of less than
  one hundred fifty persons and which is served by a safe area of  another
  assembly  space,  when  such  safe  area  is in the direction of egress.
  Ventilating systems for safe areas shall not  be  connected  to  systems
  serving  any  other  spaces,  unless separated from such systems by fire
  dampers  actuated  by   smoke   detectors   meeting   the   construction
  requirements of subchapter thirteen of this chapter.
    (1)  COLLECTING  SAFE  AREAS.  Places of assembly having more than one
  assembly space may  have  a  collecting  safe  area  that  receives  the
  occupant  load  discharged  into it by other safe areas. Collecting safe
  areas shall be located within six feet above or below the assembly space
  nearest to grade.
    (2) OCCUPANT LOAD. The occupant load of  a  safe  area  shall  be  the
  aggregate  occupant  load of all exit openings discharging directly into
  it. The occupant load of a collecting safe area shall be  the  aggregate
  occupant  load  of  all exit openings discharging directly into it, plus
  fifty per cent of the occupant load of other safe areas discharging into
  it.
    (3) DIMENSIONS.  Except  as  provided  in  subdivision  four  of  this
  section,  the  clear  unobstructed floor area of each safe area shall be
  sufficient to accommodate the total occupant load of the  safe  area  on
  the basis of two square feet per person, not including space occupied by
  furniture or equipment. The minimum dimension of such unobstructed space
  shall  be  eight  feet.  The  width  of  the unobstructed space shall be
  measured at right angles to the direction of travel to an exit and shall
  not be less than required for the occupant load, on  the  basis  of  the
  exit  capacity listed in table 8-1. The height of safe areas shall be at
  least eight feet at all points.
    (4) SAFE AREAS NEAR GRADE. When a safe area provides egress to an open
  exterior space, either directly or through a vestibule,  the  safe  area
  need  not  provide  the floor area required by subdivision three of this
  section when the level of discharge from  the  safe  area  to  the  open
  exterior  space  is  not more than four feet above or below the grade of
  the open exterior space.
    (5) RAMPS AND STEPS. Ramps in safe areas shall have a gradient of  not
  more  than  one  in  twelve,  except that when not exceeding six feet in
  length, the gradient may be not greater than one in ten. Steps  in  safe
  areas shall comply with the following requirements:
    a.  No  riser  shall  be  less than six inches nor more than seven and
  one-half inches high.
    b. No riser shall vary in height from the riser immediately  above  or
  below it.
    c.  Treads  in  flights  of  steps  shall be at least ten and one-half
  inches wide exclusive of nosing, and, except as provided in paragraph  d
  of  this  subdivision, the sum of two risers plus the width of one tread
  shall be at least twenty-four inches but not more than  twenty-five  and
  one-half inches.

    d.  No change in levels shall have less than three risers, except that
  where  the  intervening  tread  is  between  twenty-eight   inches   and
  thirty-six inches, two risers may be used when the edge of each tread is
  marked by a contrasting color stripe.
    e.  Where  exit openings from an assembly space are above or below the
  level of the safe area, a platform shall be provided at the  same  level
  as  that  of  the  exit opening. The platform shall be at least one foot
  wider on each side than the exit opening, and shall extend a minimum  of
  six  feet  in the direction of exit travel. The sides of such platforms,
  and of steps or ramps leading from them, shall be protected by guards at
  least three feet high.
    (6) EXITS FROM SAFE AREAS. The capacity of exits from safe areas shall
  be as listed in table 8-1. Exit openings from safe areas shall discharge
  into exit types as provided in subchapter six of this chapter.
    (7) DOOR HARDWARE. Doors from safe areas or from exits from safe areas
  opening directly to the outdoors  and  furnished  with  locks  shall  be
  equipped  with  fire  exit  bolts  complying  with  the  requirements of
  paragraph two of subdivision (k) of section 27-371 of subchapter six  of
  this chapter.
