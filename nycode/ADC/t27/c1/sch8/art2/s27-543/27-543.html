Section 27-543

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 27-543 Light projection sources. Motion picture projection and other
  light projection sources shall comply with the following:
    (a)   Film.   The   projection,  use  or  storage  of  film  having  a
  nitro-cellulose base (commonly known  as  nitrate  film)  shall  not  be
  permitted  except  under  conditions  specified  in special permits when
  issued by the fire department. Safety film  meeting  the  specifications
  and  test  standards of reference standard RS 8-1 may be projected, used
  or stored.
    (b)  Projection  machines.  Projection   machines   shall   meet   the
  requirements  of  the  electrical code of the city of New York. The lamp
  housing of projection machines using carbon-arc or other  light  sources
  that  emit  gaseous  discharge shall be equipped with, or connected to a
  mechanical ventilation  system  of  adequate  capacity  to  exhaust  the
  products of combustion through ducts directly to the outdoors. Such duct
  systems  shall  comply  with  the requirements of subchapter thirteen of
  this chapter. When more than one projection machine  or  other  facility
  employing  a  carbon-arc  or  similar  light  source is used, all may be
  vented by the same duct system if  the  capacity  is  adequate  for  all
  facilities so connected.
    (c)  Other  light  source facilities. All devices, such as spotlights,
  that employ a carbon-arc  or  other  light  source  that  emits  gaseous
  discharge  shall  be  vented  directly as required in subdivision (b) of
  this section, unless the space in which  such  devices  are  located  is
  mechanically ventilated and provides at least two thousand cubic feet of
  room volume for each device.
    (d)  Light  or  projection  rooms  or  booths. When enclosed, rooms or
  booths  used  for  the  projection  of  motion  picture  film   or   the
  manipulating  of  lights shall be built of noncombustible materials, and
  shall provide a clear working space of at  least  two  feet  around  the
  projection  apparatus. Such rooms or booths shall be provided with vents
  opening to a mechanically ventilated area or the outdoors,  adequate  in
  size  to  supply  the make-up air required. The rooms or booths shall be
  provided with at least one noncombustible or metal clad  door  at  least
  two  feet  by  six  feet opening in the direction of exit travel, and no
  point within the room, booth, or gallery shall be more than  fifty  feet
  from  a door opening into a corridor or space that provides access to an
  exit at a distance not greater than seventy-five feet.
