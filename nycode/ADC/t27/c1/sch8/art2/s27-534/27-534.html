Section 27-534

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-534  Exit  openings.  Exit  openings  from assembly spaces shall
  comply with the following:
    (a) Capacity. The capacity of exit openings  shall  be  listed  as  in
  table  8-1,  based  on  the  number  of  occupants  for whom the opening
  satisfies the primary travel distance requirement.
    (b) Width. Exit openings shall be at least thirty-six inches wide  for
  single   doors   and  at  least  sixty-six  inches  but  not  more  than
  eighty-eight inches wide for doors swinging in  pairs,  except  that  in
  assembly  spaces  having an occupant load of over three hundred persons,
  single door openings shall be at least forty-four inches wide.
    (c) Classification.  Exit  openings  from  assembly  spaces  shall  be
  classified as follows:
    Class  1. Exit openings that are used for normal entry to the assembly
  space, and that open directly to a safe area  or  to  an  open  exterior
  space.
    Class  2.  Exit  openings  that  are  not used for normal entry to the
  assembly space, and that open directly to a safe  area  or  to  an  open
  exterior space.
    Class  3.  Exit  openings  that  open  from  the  assembly  space into
  corridors, exit passageways, or vertical exits.
    (d) Distribution of classes.  The  required  exit  capacity  from  F-2
  places  of assembly, and from all other assembly spaces in which the net
  floor area, exclusive of stage area, is twelve square feet or  more  per
  person  may be provided by exit openings of any class. The required exit
  capacity from assembly spaces in which the net floor area, exclusive  of
  stage  area,  is  less  than  twelve  square  feet  per  person shall be
  distributed so that exit openings of each class are provided  to  comply
  with the following requirements:
    1.  For assembly spaces in which the mean floor level is not more than
  fifteen feet above or below the  adjoining  grade  elevation,  the  exit
  capacity  shall  be distributed as follows: Class 1--not less than forty
  per cent
    Class 2--not more than sixty per cent
    Class 3--not more than forty per cent
    2. For assembly spaces in which the mean  floor  level  is  more  than
  fifteen  feet,  but  not  more  than  thirty  feet,  above  or below the
  adjoining grade elevation, the exit capacity  shall  be  distributed  as
  follows:
    Class 1--not less than sixty per cent
    Class 3--not more than forty per cent
    3.  For  assembly  spaces  in  which the mean floor level is more than
  thirty feet above or below  the  adjoining  grade  elevation,  the  exit
  capacity shall be distributed as follows:
    Class 1--not less than one hundred per cent
    (e)  Location. No exit opening shall be closer than twelve feet to any
  part of a stage using scenery or  scenic  elements.  All  exit  openings
  shall  be  clearly  identifiable and shall not be disguised as part of a
  wall or covered in any way to obscure them from view. Where, because  of
  the configuration of the assembly space enclosure an exit opening is not
  visible  from  all seats using it as a means of egress, directional exit
  signs shall be placed on the enclosure alongside  the  exit  opening  to
  indicate  its  location.  These  signs  shall  be  in  addition to those
  required over the exit opening.
    (f) Locking. No exit door shall be locked so as to prevent egress from
  an assembly space while it is occupied.
