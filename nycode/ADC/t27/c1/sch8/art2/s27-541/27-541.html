    &sect;  27-541 Exit signs. Signs meeting the requirements of subchapter six
  of this chapter and subdivision (e) of section 27-534  of  this  article
  shall  be  provided  in  all assembly spaces to indicate the location of
  exits and, where necessary, the direction to  the  exits.  All  exit  or
  directional  signs shall be placed so that they are clearly visible from
  all parts of the assembly spaces, and the bottom of all signs  shall  be
  at  least seven feet above floor level. Signs shall be of the internally
  lighted type in all assembly spaces where the  general  illumination  is
  reduced  to  less  than five foot candles during a performance or during
  occupancy. Signs shall be lighted at all times during occupancy.
 
             (For Table 8-1 see chapter 839 of the laws of 1986)
 
    Notes:
    a See section 27-533. When an exit  opening  from  an  assembly  space
  discharges  into  corridor  that  does not meet the requirements of this
  code for a safe area, the travel distance  shall  include  the  distance
  within the corridor to an exit.
    b See paragraph four of subdivision (b) of section 27-546 for stages.
    c See paragraph three of subdivision (b) of section 27-547 for stages.
    d In places of assembly completely equipped with automatic sprinklers,
  this distance may be increased fifty percent.
    e See section 27-532.
