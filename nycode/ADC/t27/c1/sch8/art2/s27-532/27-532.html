Section 27-532

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-532  Aisles and cross aisles. Assembly spaces shall be served by
  aisles, cross aisles, or other unobstructed floor areas providing access
  to exits, except as permitted for bleacher seating in paragraph  two  of
  subdivision (a) of section 27-531 of this article.
    (a) The capacity of aisles and cross aisles shall be adequate to serve
  all  persons  for whom they provide a primary path of travel to an exit.
  (See section 27-533 of this article.)
    (1) CAPACITY. The capacity of aisles and  cross  aisles  shall  be  as
  listed  in  table 8-1. The unit of exit width shall be twenty-two inches
  Seats or other facilities shall not project into an aisle or cross aisle
  so as to reduce the width of the aisle or cross aisle more than one inch
  per unit of exit width.
    (2) MINIMUM WIDTH. Aisles and cross aisles shall have a minimum  width
  of  forty-four  inches  except that the width may be at least thirty-six
  inches under any one or more of the following conditions:
    a. In any assembly space having a total of not more than three hundred
  occupants.
    b. When not more than the number of persons permitted for one unit  of
  exit width is served.
    c.  At  the  narrowest  point  when a tapered aisle is permitted under
  paragraph three of this subdivision.
    d. When an aisle parallels and  is  alongside  an  enclosure  wall  or
  partition  that is provided with exit doors spaced not more than sixteen
  feet on centers, provided such aisle  serves  only  the  rows  of  seats
  adjacent to it.
    (3)  TAPERED  AISLES.  Tapered  aisles  shall  be used where egress is
  provided only at one end of the aisle, except that uniform aisles may be
  used when their width for the entire length will accommodate eighty  per
  cent  of  the  total  occupant  load served by the aisle. Tapered aisles
  shall be widened gradually so that their width at the point of discharge
  provides for the entire occupant load of the aisle.
    (4) UNIFORM AISLES. Aisles of uniform width shall be used where egress
  is provided at both ends of an aisle by  either  cross  aisles  or  exit
  doors.  The  width of uniform aisles shall not be less than required for
  sixty per cent of the total occupant load served by the aisles.
    (5) AISLE WIDTH AT OPENINGS. When an aisle or cross  aisle  discharges
  directly  into exit openings, a space shall be provided in front of such
  openings that is at least as wide as such openings and at least as  deep
  as the width of the aisle or cross aisle.
    (6)  CROSS AISLES. Cross aisles, at any point shall not be closer than
  twelve feet to a stage area using scenery or scenic elements.  Steppings
  shall not be permitted in cross aisles.
    (7)  AISLE  GRADIENTS AND STEPPINGS. The floors of aisles shall have a
  gradient of not more than one in  eight.  Where  differences  in  levels
  require  a  greater  gradient,  steps  shall be used, complying with the
  following:
    a. When one riser only is used between levels of platforms, its height
  shall not exceed eight inches, and where more than one  riser  is  used,
  none shall exceed seven and three-quarter inches.
    b. No riser shall be less than four inches high.
    c.  No riser shall vary from the height of the riser immediately above
  or below except that risers that are separated by a tread  of  seventeen
  inches or more may vary up to one-quarter inch.
    d.  The  width of treads of intermediate steps between platform levels
  shall be at least nine and one-half inches, but not more  than  ten  and
  one-half inches, exclusive of nosings.
    e.  Treads  at  the level of platforms and seventeen inches or more in
  width may slope not more than one-quarter inch in twelve inches.

    f. No steps shall be used to enter a row of seats from an aisle unless
  an unobstructed floor space of at least seven square feet is provided at
  the level of the aisle, between the aisle and the steps.
    g.  Each  step  in  an  aisle  shall be marked along its nosing with a
  permanent contrasting color stripe, and shall be provided  with  a  step
  light.
    h.  The  line  of risers of aisle steppings shall deviate no more than
  twenty degrees from a line perpendicular to the centerline of the aisle.
    (8) STEPPED AISLE LANDINGS. Stepped  aisles  shall  be  provided  with
  landings at exit openings, and shall have a length equal to at least the
  width of the aisle and a slope of not more than one in twelve.
    (9)  LIGHTING.  Aisles and cross aisles shall be provided at all times
  with at  least  one-half  foot  candle  of  artificial  illumination  by
  electrical means.
    (10)  VOMITORIES.  Vomitories within assembly spaces shall comply with
  all of the requirements for aisles,  and  shall  have  a  clear  ceiling
  height of at least seven feet.
