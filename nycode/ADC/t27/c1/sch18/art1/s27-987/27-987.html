  apply to portable elevating devices used to handle materials only except

    (1) Fire protection. The fire resistance rating of hoistway enclosures

    (2)  Impact  resistance. Elevator enclosures serving occupancy group E

  applications  filed on or after July 1, 2006, shall comply with rules to
  be  promulgated  by  the  commissioner   establishing   minimum   impact
  resistance standards. Such rules shall permit compliance with assemblies
  comprising  approved  reinforced  construction  boards affixed onto stud
  framing. The commissioner shall  promulgate  such  rules  on  or  before
