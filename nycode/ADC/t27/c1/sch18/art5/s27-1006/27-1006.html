Section 27-1006

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 27-1006 Accidents. The owner or person in charge of the equipment or
  devices  listed  in article one of this subchapter shall promptly notify
  the commissioner of  every  accident  involving  injury  to  any  person
  requiring  the  services  of  a  physician  or  damage to property or to
  apparatus exceeding one hundred dollars on, about, or in connection with
  such equipment, and shall afford the  commissioner  every  facility  for
  investigating  such  accident  or damage. The commissioner shall make an
  investigation immediately thereafter,  and  shall  prepare  a  full  and
  complete  report of such investigation. Such report shall give in detail
  all material facts and information available and the cause or causes  as
  far  as  they  can  be  determined.  Such report shall be open to public
  inspection at all  reasonable  hours.  When  an  accident  involves  the
  failure  or  destruction  of  any  part of the construction or operating
  mechanism of such equipment, no such equipment shall be  used  until  it
  has  been  made  safe,  and  re-inspected  by  the commissioner; and the
  commissioner may order the discontinuance of such equipment until a  new
  use  permit  has been issued by him or her for its use. No part shall be
  removed from the premises  of  the  damaged  construction  or  operating
  mechanism   until   permission   to  do  so  has  been  granted  by  the
  commissioner.
