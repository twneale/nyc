<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 27-1005 Operators. Every power driven passenger elevator and freight
  elevator  with a rise of more than one story, except automatic operation
  and continuous pressure elevators and sidewalk elevators,  shall  be  in
  charge  of  a  designated  competent  operator,  who  shall  be at least
  eighteen years old, free from serious physical or  mental  defects,  and
  selected  with  consideration  of his or her abilities to perform his or
  her duties  in  a  careful  and  competent  manner,  and  who  has  been
  instructed  in  accordance  with  the  requirements of the commissioner,
  except as otherwise specifically provided by law. Operators of amusement
  devices that require the services of a  regular  operator  shall  be  at
  least  eighteen  years  of  age  and shall have secured a certificate of
  competence from the commissioner. If the  commissioner  finds  that  any
  person  engaged  in  running  an  elevator  or  amusement  device is not
  competent to operate the elevator or device, the owner, agent or  lessee
  of  such  elevator  or  amusement  device  shall,  upon  notice from the
  commissioner, discontinue the operation of such  elevator  or  amusement
  device  by  such  operator.  Other devices listed in article one of this
  subchapter shall, when deemed  necessary  by  the  commissioner,  be  in
  charge   of   a   designated   competent  operator  conforming  to  such
  qualifications as the commissioner may prescribe except  that  operators
  for  workers'  hoists  shall  be  assigned as required by the applicable
  provisions of reference standard RS 18-7.
