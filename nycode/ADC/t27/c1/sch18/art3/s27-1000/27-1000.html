Section 27-1000

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-1000  Inspection  agencies  and elevator repair service. (a) The
  required periodic inspections shall be made  by  the  department  except
  that  two of the five inspections required every two years for elevators
  and escalators shall be made on behalf of  the  owner  by  an  insurance
  company,  elevator  maintenance company, elevator manufacturer, elevator
  inspection company, or other person, each of which must be acceptable to
  the commissioner. The department shall promulgate rules and  regulations
  establishing  criteria  as  to  the  qualifications of such companies or
  persons. Such owner shall cause such inspections to be performed between
  January first and September fifteenth of each year. Reports  by  private
  inspection  agencies  shall  be  on  such  forms  and  in such manner as
  required by the commissioner. Such report  shall  be  delivered  to  the
  owner  of each elevator or escalator inspected listing all violations of
  any of the provisions of this subchapter within five days of inspection,
  and a signed copy of the report of each inspection shall be  filed  with
  the  commissioner.  The failure to have such inspection performed within
  the prescribed period and  to  file  a  copy  of  the  report  with  the
  department  on  or  before  September  thirtieth of each year shall be a
  violation of this section, which shall be  punishable  pursuant  to  the
  provisions  of  section 26-125 of title twenty-six of the administrative
  code. After such violation is placed the owner may file such report  and
  the  department  shall  enter  a  notation in its records of the date on
  which such report was received by the  department.  After  the  date  of
  receipt  by the department, the per diem penalty provided by subdivision
  c of section 26-125 of title twenty-six of the administrative code shall
  be stayed. The department shall maintain the violation on  its  records,
  with  a  notation of the date on which such a report was received by the
  department. On or before October fifteenth of each year all  defects  as
  found upon such inspection shall be corrected.
    (b)  In  addition  to  the  requirements  of  subdivision  (a) of this
  section, all reports filed on or after  April  first,  nineteen  hundred
  eighty-seven  for  existing  buildings  required  to  install  stair and
  elevator signs pursuant to section 27-390, elevator in readiness systems
  pursuant to paragraph two  of  subdivision  (c)  of  section  27-989  of
  article  one of this subchapter or firemen service operation pursuant to
  section 27-996.2 of article two of  this  subchapter,  shall  contain  a
  certification  that the required installation has been made. The reports
  shall be on such forms and  in  such  manner  as  the  commissioner  may
  require. Failure to file such report by such a date shall be a violation
  of  this  section, and shall be punishable pursuant to section 26-125 of
  title twenty-six of the administrative code.
    (c) In multiple dwellings (either J1  or  J2  occupancy  groups),  the
  owner  shall  be  required  to  have  a contract with an elevator repair
  person or company authorizing  the  performance  of  emergency  elevator
  repair work.  Such repair person or company shall be one of the elevator
  inspection  agencies or inspectors employed thereby currently acceptable
  to the commissioner. The name, address  and  telephone  number  of  such
  elevator  repair person or company shall be maintained on each premises,
  in a location readily accessible to employees of  this  department,  and
  maintenance or custodial staff at the premises.
