Section 27-1004

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-1004  Posting  of  inspection  certificate.--a.  At the time the
  equipment use permit is issued, an inspection certificate issued by  the
  commissioner  shall  be  posted. No such certificate shall be issued for
  elevators which are not subject  to  periodic  inspections  pursuant  to
  section  27-998.  The certificate shall be in such form as determined by
  the commissioner and shall be posted in the car of every  passenger  and
  freight  elevator  and  on  or  near  every escalator and power operated
  scaffold and in a frame with a transparent cover.
    b. In place of posting  inspection  certificates  in  those  locations
  specified  in subdivision a of this section, certificates may be kept in
  the on site building manager's office. In a building where  this  option
  is elected, there must be a building manager's office open during normal
  business  hours,  and there must be posted in each location specified in
  subdivision a of this section a notice in a  frame  with  a  transparent
  cover,  or  a  plaque  with  an  indelible inscription, stating that the
  inspection certificate is located in the building manager's  office  and
  identifying the location of such office.
