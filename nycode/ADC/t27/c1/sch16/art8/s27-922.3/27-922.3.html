  men and women.
    d. This section is only intended to change  the  ratio  of  men's  and
  women's  water  closets required under title 27 of this code as provided
  herein, and is not intended to require more than one  water  closet  per
  fifty  persons  for  occupancy  by 450 persons or less, or more than one
  water closet per one hundred persons for  occupancy  by  more  than  450
  persons.
