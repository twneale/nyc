  approval  of  gas installation from the department of buildings is filed
  with such  utility  company.  When  new  gas  service  piping  has  been

  meter piping (other than utility owned) and gas distribution piping  has
  been  inspected and certified as required by the department of buildings
  as being ready for service.
