Section 27-901

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-901  General  requirements.  Plumbing  and  gas  piping shall be
  designed and installed so as to satisfy the following conditions and the
  requirements of reference standard RS-16:
    (a) All occupied premises shall have  potable  water.  Every  building
  intended  for human habitation, occupancy, or use shall be provided with
  a supply of potable water.
    (b)  Sufficient  water  required.  Plumbing  fixtures,  devices,   and
  appurtenances  shall  be supplied with water in sufficient volume and at
  pressures adequate to  enable  them  to  function  properly.  The  pipes
  conveying  the  water  shall  be of sufficient size to provide the water
  required without undue pressure reduction and without undue noise  under
  all normal conditions of use.
    (c) Water conservation. Plumbing shall be designed and adjusted to use
  the  minimum  quantity  of  water consistent with proper performance and
  cleansing of the fixture of plumbing appurtenance.
    (d) Safeguarding against explosion. Devices for  heating  and  storing
  water  shall  be  designed,  installed,  and maintained to guard against
  rupture of the containing vessel through overheating.
    (e) Connection to public water  supply  systems  and  to  sanitary  or
  combined sewer systems.
    (1) GENERAL. a. The water distribution system and system for conveying
  sewage  from any building in which plumbing fixtures are installed shall
  be connected, respectively, to a public water main  and  a  sanitary  or
  combined sewer if either or both are available and, regarding the sewer,
  if  the  department  determines that connection thereto is feasible. The
  department shall determine that connection is feasible if:
    1. the sewer is of adequate capacity to  receive  all  sewage  flowing
  from the building;
    2. the sewer is in adequate physical condition to receive such sewage;
    3.  no  physical obstacles exist, between the boundaries of the lot or
  tract of land on which the building is  located  and  the  sewer,  which
  would make connection to the sewer impracticable;
    4.  the elevation of the sewer in relation to the lot or tract of land
  on which the building is located is such that conveyance of  the  sewage
  from the building to the sewer is not impracticable;
    5.  the  sewer  is located in the same drainage area as all or most of
  the lot or tract of land on which the building is located; and
    6. no other factor reasonably related to the conveyance of sewage from
  the building to the sewer would make such  connection  impracticable  or
  undesirable as a proper means of sewage disposal.
    b.  Where  a public water main is not available, an individual potable
  water supply shall be provided, and  where  neither  a  sanitary  nor  a
  combined  sewer  is  available  to  which the department determines that
  connection is feasible, a  private  sewer  or  private  sewage  disposal
  system  shall  be  provided.  All such private systems shall be provided
  subject to the approval of the commissioner and of any other  agency  or
  agencies  having  jurisdiction,  and  constructed in accordance with the
  requirements of reference  standard  RS-16  and,  with  respect  to  the
  construction  of  individual on site private sewage disposal systems, in
  accordance with the  specifications  and  standards  prescribed  by  the
  commissioner,  in  consultation  with  the commissioner of environmental
  protection, pursuant to section six hundred forty-three of the charter.
    c. Extensions of public sewers  and  water  mains  shall  be  made  in
  accordance  with  the  regulations  of  the  department of environmental
  protection.
    (2) SYSTEMS AVAILABLE. a. A public  water  main,  and  a  sanitary  or
  combined  sewer  for  the  purpose  of conveying sewage, shall be deemed
  available to a building in which plumbing fixtures are installed, except

  to a one- or two-family dwelling, if a property line of such building is
  within  five  hundred  feet  (measured  along  a   street,   alley,   or
  right-of-way)  of  the  public  water  supply  system  or the sewer. The
  connection  shall be made in accordance with the applicable standards of
  the department of environmental protection.
    b. A public water supply system, and a sanitary or combined sewer  for
  the purpose of conveying sewage, shall be deemed available to a one- and
  two-family  dwelling  if  a property line of such dwelling is within one
  hundred feet (measured along a street, alley, or  right-of-way)  of  the
  public water supply system or the sewer. The connection shall be made in
  accordance   with   the   applicable  standards  of  the  department  of
  environmental  protection,  provided,  however,  that  such   one-   and
  two-family dwelling need not connect directly to the sewer if the common
  elements  of  an  internal  private  drain  are  located in a dedicated,
  unobstructed right-of-way that extends to the sewer with a minimum width
  of ten feet located entirely  outside  of  the  building  footprint  and
  outside  of  all  overhangs  and projections that are less than fourteen
  feet in height above grade.
    c.  Where  two  or  more  one-  or  two-family  dwellings  are  to  be
  constructed  on  a  tract of land, or where a substantial improvement of
  any other type of building or buildings is contemplated on  a  tract  of
  land,  the  public  water  supply system and/or the sanitary or combined
  sewer  may  be  declared  available  thereto  by  the  agencies   having
  jurisdiction   thereon   even   though   the   distances   specified  in
  subparagraphs a and b of this paragraph are exceeded.
    (f) Well water systems. No well or  individual  water  supply  may  be
  installed  for  any purpose without the approval of the commissioner and
  of the department of health and mental hygiene  and  the  department  of
  environmental protection.
    (g)  Design  and  maintenance  of  system  for  conveying  sewage from
  building.  The system for conveying sewage from the  building  shall  be
  designed,  constructed  and maintained to guard against fouling, deposit
  of solids, and clogging, and shall be provided with  adequate  cleanouts
  so arranged that the pipes may be readily cleaned.
    (h) Exclusion of certain substances from the plumbing system.
    (1) DETRIMENTAL OR DANGEROUS MATERIAL. No person shall deposit, by any
  means,  any of the following into the building drainage system or sewer:
  ashes, cinders, rags, flammable, poisonous, or explosive liquids, gases,
  oils, grease, or any other material  that  could  obstruct,  damage,  or
  overload  such system, or that could interfere with the normal operation
  of the sewage treatment processes.
    (2)  INDUSTRIAL  WASTES.  Wastes  from  hospitals,  chemical   plants,
  laundries,  abattoirs,  or  any  other  industrial  wastes that could be
  detrimental to the public sewer  or  public  health,  shall  be  treated
  before  such wastes are discharged into the public sewer. At the time of
  the filing of plumbing plans for any hospital, chemical plant,  laundry,
  abattoir,  or any other industrial structure, a statement shall be filed
  with the commissioner indicating the substances, ingredients, or matter,
  that will be discharged into the sewer, together with  written  approval
  of  the  department  of  environmental  protection  for  the  method  of
  treatment  of  said  substance,  ingredient  or  matter,  before  it  is
  discharged into the public sewer.
    (i)  Prevention  of  contamination.  Plumbing  fixtures,  devices, and
  appliances  shall  be  provided  with  adequate  protection  to  prevent
  contamination  of  food,  water, sterile goods, and similar materials by
  backflow of sewage. The fixture, device, or appliance shall be connected
  indirectly with the building drainage system when necessary.

    (j) Drainage below street level. The  drainage  of  all  sanitary  and
  storm  water below the crown level of the street sewer, or below a level
  where backflow from the street sewer is possible, shall be conveyed to a
  sewage ejector and/or sump through a  system  of  subhouse  drains,  and
  lifted into the street sewer or disposal system.
    (k)  Disposal of storm water. Storm water falling or coming to rest on
  property on which new buildings or substantial  horizontal  enlargements
  are  to  be  constructed,  and  on  all  streets  and  other paved areas
  constructed or altered in connection with the construction of  such  new
  buildings  or  substantial horizontal enlargements, shall be disposed of
  in accordance with the requirements of reference standard RS-16 and  the
  rules  and regulations of the department of environmental protection. No
  person providing a system for disposing of storm water, as  required  by
  this  subdivision,  shall  in  any  way  alter,  relocate  or affect any
  existing drainage system on the property, except in accordance with  the
  provisions  of  section  19-137  of title nineteen of the administrative
  code. Except as otherwise  permitted  by  this  code,  no  person  shall
  perform  land  contour  work, as defined in section 19-137 of this code,
  which work causes storm water  to  flow  across  sidewalks  or  onto  an
  adjacent   property.   For   purposes  of  this  subdivision,  the  term
  "substantial horizontal enlargement" shall have the meaning  given  such
  term in subdivision (a) of section P110.2 of reference standard RS-16.
    (l)  Required  plumbing  fixtures.  Every  dwelling  unit in buildings
  classified in occupancy groups J-2 and J-3 shall have at least one water
