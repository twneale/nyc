    &sect;   27-908   Cross-connection  of  supplies  and  identification.  (a)
  Cross-connection. No person shall connect water piping supplied directly
  from street water mains to other sources; and no cross-connection  shall
  be made between the potable water distribution system and any portion of
  waste  or soil systems, or between the potable water distribution system
  and fixtures or devices that  may  contaminate,  pollute,  or  otherwise
  render the water nonpotable.
    (b) Identification. Water supply systems not approved as potable shall
  be  identified at each outlet with a warning sign stating that the water
  is unfit, and its use prohibited, for drinking purposes. Piping carrying
  potable water shall be identified and distinguished  from  water  piping
  carrying  nonpotable  water  by  distinctive  painting  or  markings  as
  prescribed in reference standard RS-16.
    (c) Construction. The construction of water supply systems shall be in
  accordance with the requirements of reference standard RS-16.
