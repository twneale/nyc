    &sect; 27-868 Smoke test. (a) General. When required by the commissioner to
  determine  the  tightness of chimney construction, a smoke test shall be
  made in accordance with the following conditions and requirements:
    (1) The equipment, materials, power and labor necessary for such  test
  shall be furnished by, and at the expense of, the owner or holder of the
  work permit.
    (2)  If  the test shows any evidence of leakage or other defects, such
  defects shall be corrected in accordance with the  requirement  of  this
  subchapter  and  the  test  shall  be  repeated  until  the  results are
  satisfactory.
    (b) Method  of  test.  The  chimney  shall  be  filled  with  a  thick
  penetrating  smoke  produced  by  one  or  more smoke machines, or smoke
  bombs, or other equivalent method. As the smoke  appears  at  the  stack
  opening on the roof, such opening shall be tightly closed and a pressure
  equivalent  to one-half inch column of water measured at the base of the
  stack, shall be applied. The test shall be applied for a length of  time
  sufficient to permit the inspection of the chimney.
