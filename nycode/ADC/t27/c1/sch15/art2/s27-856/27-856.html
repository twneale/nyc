Section 27-856

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-856  General requirements. (a) Equipment requiring chimneys. All
  gas-burning equipment that produces flue gas temperatures in  excess  of
  five  hundred  fifty  degrees  Fahrenheit or four hundred eighty degrees
  Fahrenheit above room temperature, and all solid and liquid fuel-burning
  equipment,  shall  be  connected  to  chimneys  that  conform   to   the
  requirements of this subchapter.
    (b)  Chimney  construction.  Unlisted chimneys shall be constructed of
  steel, brick, masonry units, concrete,  concrete  units,  or  equivalent
  materials.  Chimneys  shall  be  of  adequate  structural strength, with
  resistance suitable for the temperatures to which they may be  subjected
  and   resistive  to  the  corrosive  action  of  gases.  For  structural
  requirements, see subchapters ten and eleven of this chapter.
    (c) Separation of flues. Whenever more  than  one  flue  is  installed
  within  a  chimney, the lining of each flue shall be separated, one from
  the other, as follows:
    (1) In low temperature chimneys with fire  clay  flue  linings:  by  a
  wythe  of  cement  grout  at  least  one  inch thick or other equivalent
  method.
    (2) In medium temperature and high temperature chimneys: by a division
  wall of brick or concrete at least three and three-quarters inches thick
  or other equivalent method. The separation  between  flue  linings  thus
  established  shall  in  all  cases be adequate to give stability for the
  chimney construction as required by subchapter ten of this chapter.
    (d) Test run. All new chimneys shall be  test  run  by  the  applicant
  under  operating  conditions to demonstrate fire safety and the complete
  exhausting of smoke and the products of combustion to the outer air. The
  results of such test run shall be certified as correct by the  applicant
  and shall be submitted in writing to the department.
    (e) Requirement of a smoke test. Whenever required by the commissioner
  after  an inspection has been made of the chimney, a smoke test shall be
  made as outlined in section 27-868 of this article. Any faults or  leaks
  found  shall  be  corrected.  Such  smoke  test  shall be witnessed by a
  representative of the commissioner. In lieu  thereof,  the  commissioner
  may accept the test report of an architect or engineer in which case the
  test shall be subject to the provisions for controller inspection except
  that the architect or engineer may be retained by the contractor.
