Section 27-869

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-869  Exhaust gases from internal combustion engines. (a) Exhaust
  pipe construction. The exhaust pipe  from  internal  combustion  engines
  shall  be  constructed  in  accordance  with  the requirements for metal
  chimneys based on the temperature of  the  gases  entering  the  exhaust
  pipe, and in accordance with the following:
    (1)  The  requirements for at least a medium temperature chimney shall
  apply.
    (2) The exhaust pipe shall be constructed of at least three-sixteenths
  inch steel, or  of  other  equivalent  metal  of  similar  strength  and
  resistance to the temperature and corrosive action of the exhaust gases.
    (3) No lining shall be required.
    (4)  Where  the  exhaust  pipe  runs  inside  a  building, it shall be
  insulated with an insulation adequate for the temperature of  the  pipe,
  so  that  the  surface  temperature  shall  be not more than two hundred
  degrees Fahrenheit.
    (5) All joints shall be constructed so as to  be  gastight  under  all
  operating  conditions.  No  threaded  joints  shall be permitted in pipe
  sizes over four inches or in pipe of  a  thickness  less  than  that  of
  schedule 40 steel pipe.
    (b)  Location  of  discharge  opening.  The  location of the discharge
  opening of the exhaust  pipe  shall  comply  with  the  requirements  of
  subdivision  (d) of section 27-776 of article one of subchapter thirteen
  of this chapter, and, in addition,  the  opening  shall  be  located  or
  arranged  so  that it cannot cause condensate leaving the outlet to come
  in contact with people. The exhaust pipe may be connected to  a  chimney
  used for other equipment, provided that the operation of the engine does
  not adversely affect the operation of the other equipment so as to cause
  a  fire  or health hazard, or to cause the emissions from the chimney to
  be in violation of the air pollution control code.
