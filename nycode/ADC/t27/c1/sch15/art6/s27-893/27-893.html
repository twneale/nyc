    &sect; 27-893 Clearances. (a) Minimum clearance. Minimum clearances at vent
  connectors  to combustible materials shall not be less than those listed
  in table 15-10.
    (b) Reduced clearances. These  clearances  may  be  reduced  when  the
  combustible construction is protected as provided in table 15-11.

  Notes:
    a. Except for the protection described in (e) above, all clearances
  should  be  measured  from  the  outer  surface  of the appliance to the
  combustible material disregarding any intervening protection applied  to
  the combustible material.
    b. Applied to the combustible material unless otherwise specified and
  covering  all  surfaces  within  the  distance specified as the required
  clearance with no protection. Thicknesses are minimum.
    c. Spacers shall be on noncombustible material.
