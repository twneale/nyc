    &sect;   27-872   Chimney   connector   clearances.  (a)  From  combustible
  construction. The minimum distance between the chimney connector and any
  combustible material or construction shall be:
    (1) eighteen  inches  for  chimney  connectors  from  low  temperature
  equipment.
    (2)  thirty-six  inches for chimney connectors from medium temperature
  and high temperature equipment.
    (b) Reduced  clearances.  The  above  clearances  may  be  reduced  as
  outlined in table 15-8 in accordance with the type of protection applied
  to the combustible material or construction.
 
                      TABLE 15-8 REDUCED CLEARANCES FOR
                           CHIMNEY CONNECTORS WITH
                   SPECIFIED FORM OF PROTECTION (1,2,3,4)
                                             Where the required clearance
            Type of Protection                   with no protection is:
  Applied to the combustible material       36 in.  18 in.  9 in.  6 in.
  and covering all surfaces within
  the distance specified as the required
  clearance with no protection.
  Thicknesses are minimum.
    (a) 0.027 in. (23 gauge) sheet
  metal spaced out 1 in.                    18 in.   9 in.  4 in.  2 in.
    (b) 3 1/2 in. thick masonry wall
  spaced out 1 in. and adequately tied
  to the wall being protected.              18 in.   9 in.  4 in.  2 in.
    (See Note 4.)
    (c) 0.027 in. (23 gauge) sheet
  metal on 1 in. mineral wool batts
  reinforced with wire or equivalent
  spaced out in 1 in.                       12 in.   3 in.  2 in.  2 in.
 
  Notes:
    1. Spacers and ties shall be of noncombustible material.
    2.  All  methods  of  protection  require adequate ventilation between
  protective material and adjacent combustible walls and ceilings.
    3. Mineral wool batts (blanket or board) shall have a minimum  density
  of 8 lb. per cu. ft. and a minimum melting point of 1500Â°F.
    4.  If  a  single wall connector passes through the masonry wall there
  shall be at least 1/2 in. open ventilated airspace between the connector
  and the masonry.
