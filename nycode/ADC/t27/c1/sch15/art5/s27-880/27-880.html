    (b) Built-in domestic cooking units for which a vent is  not  required
  by reference standard RS 15-2.
    (c) Hot plates and laundry stoves.
    (d) Type 1 clothes dryers.
    (*e)  Water  heaters  with  inputs not over five thousand Btu/hr. (See
  note below.)
    (*f) Automatically controlled instantaneous water heaters that  supply
  water  to  a  single  faucet which is attached to and made a part of the
  equipment.
    (*g) A single booster type (automatic instantaneous) water heater when
  designed and used solely for the  sanitizing  rinse  requirements  of  a
  national  sanitation  foundation  class  one,  two  or three dishwashing
  machine, provided that the input is limited to  fifty  thousand  Btu/hr.
  the  storage  capacity is limited to twelve and one-half gallons and the
  heater is installed in a commercial kitchen having a mechanical  exhaust
  system.
    (*h) Refrigerators.
    (*i) Counter equipment.
    (*j)  Room  heaters  for  which  a  vent  is not required by reference

    (*l) Specialized equipment of limited input such as laboratory burners
  or gas lights.
    Note:  When  any, or all, of the equipment marked with an asterisk (*)
  is installed so that the aggregate input rating exceeds  thirty  Btu/hr.
  per  cubic  foot  of room or space in which it is installed, one or more
  pieces of the equipment shall be provided with a venting system or other
  equivalent means for removing the vent gases to the outdoor air so  that
  the  aggregate input rating of the remaining unvented equipment does not
  exceed the thirty Btu/hr. per cubic foot figure. When the room or  space
  in  which  such  equipment is installed is directly connected to another
  room or space by a doorway, archway,  or  other  opening  of  comparable
  size,  which cannot be closed, the volume of such adjacent room or space
  may be included in the calculations.
