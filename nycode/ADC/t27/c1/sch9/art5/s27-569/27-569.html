  pressures  due  to wind as prescribed in reference standard RS 9-5. Wind
  shall be assumed to act from any direction. For continuous framing,  the
  effects of partial loading conditions shall be considered.
    (b)  Earthquake  loads.  Every building, structure and portion thereof
  shall, at a minimum, be designed and constructed to resist  the  effects
  of seismic ground motions as prescribed in reference standard RS 9-6.
