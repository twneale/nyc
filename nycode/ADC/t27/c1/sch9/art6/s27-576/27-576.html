Section 27-576

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-576  Thermal  forces. The design of enclosed buildings more than
  two hundred fifty feet in plan dimension shall provide  for  the  forces
  and/or  movements resulting from an assumed expansion corresponding to a
  change in temperature of forty degrees F. For exterior  exposed  frames,
  arches,  or  shells  regardless  of  plan  dimensions,  the design shall
  provide for the  forces  and/or  movements  resulting  from  an  assumed
  expansion  and  contraction  corresponding to an increase or decrease in
  temperature of forty degrees F for concrete or masonry construction  and
  sixty  degrees  F  for  metal  construction.  For  determining  required
  anchorage for piping, the forces shall be determined  on  the  basis  of
  temperature  variations  for  the  specific service conditions. Friction
  forces in expansion bearings shall be considered.
