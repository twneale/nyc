Section 27-577

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 27-577 Shrinkage. The design of reinforced concrete components shall
  provide  for the forces and/or movements resulting from shrinkage of the
  concrete in the amount of 0.0002 times the  length  between  contraction
  joints for standard weight concrete, and 0.0003 times the length between
  contraction  joints  for  lightweight concrete. The design of arches and
  similar  structures  shall  provide  for  effects  of  shrinkage,   plus
  rib-shortening, plus plastic flow.
