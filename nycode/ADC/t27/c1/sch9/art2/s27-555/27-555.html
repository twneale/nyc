Section 27-555

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;   27-555  Partition  loads.  Weights  of  all  partitions  shall  be
  considered, using either actual weights at locations shown on the  plans
  or the equivalent uniform load given in subdivision (b) of this section.
    (a) Actual loads. Where actual partition weights are used, the uniform
  design  live load may be omitted from the strip of floor area under each
  partition.
    (b) Equivalent uniform load. The equivalent uniform partition loads in
  reference standard RS 9-1 may  be  used  in  lieu  of  actual  partition
  weights except for bearing partitions or partitions in toilet room areas
  (other  than in one- and two-family dwellings), at stairs and elevators,
  and similar areas where partitions  are  concentrated.  In  such  cases,
  actual  partition  weights  shall be used in design. Except as otherwise
  exempted,  equivalent  uniform  loads  shall  be  used  in  areas  where
  partitions  are  not  definitely located on the plans, or in areas where
  partitions are subject to rearrangement or location.
