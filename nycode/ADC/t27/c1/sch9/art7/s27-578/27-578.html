Section 27-578

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-578  Distribution  of  vertical  loads. Distribution of vertical
  loads to supporting members shall  be  determined  on  the  basis  of  a
  recognized  method  of  elastic  analysis  or  system of coefficients of
  approximation.  Elastic or inelastic displacements of supports shall  be
  considered  and,  for  the  distribution  of  dead loads, the modulus of
  elasticity of concrete or  composition  sections  shall  be  reduced  to
  consider  plastic  flow. Secondary effects, due to warping of the floors
  shall be considered.
