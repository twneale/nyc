Section 27-558

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-558  Live  loads  for  sidewalks,  driveways,  and railings. (a)
  Sidewalks and driveways.
    (1) When supported on grade,  all  sidewalks  for  new  buildings  and
  alterations  shall  be  subject  to  inspection  and  acceptance  by the
  commissioner. Portions of such sidewalks that are  located  between  the
  curb  line  and  the street line shall be constructed in compliance with
  the  specifications  for  concrete  sidewalks  of  the   department   of
  transportation.
    (2)   All  sidewalks  and  driveways  or  portions  thereof  that  are
  structurally supported shall be designed for a live load of one  hundred
  psf  uniformly  distributed  and  in  accordance  with the provisions of
  subchapter ten of  this  chapter.  Where  subject  to  intentionally  or
  accidentally imposed wheel loads of vehicles, such portions of sidewalks
  and  driveways shall be designed for a uniformly distributed load of six
  hundred psf or for the  maximum  vehicular  wheel  load  that  could  be
  imposed thereon, whichever develops the greater stresses.
    (3)  Appurtenant  components  of  sidewalks  and  driveways, including
  manholes,  manhole  covers,  vault  covers,  gratings,  etc.,  shall  be
  designed  for the loads prescribed in paragraph two of this subdivision,
  or  shall  conform  to  the  standards  of  the   city   agency   having
  jurisdiction.
    (b) Railings and parapets.
    (1)  Railings and parapets around stairwells, balconies, areaways, and
  roofs, and other railings in similar  locations  other  than  those  for
  places  of  assembly,  shall  be  designed  to  resist  the simultaneous
  application of a lateral force of forty plf and a vertical load of fifty
  plf, both applied to the top of the railing. For railings  and  parapets
  at  the front of theater balconies and in similar locations in places of
  assembly, the lateral force shall be increased  to  fifty  plf  and  the
  vertical  load  to one hundred plf. An exception is made for railings in
  one- and two-family dwellings, which shall be  designed  for  a  lateral
  force  of twenty plf plus a vertical load of twenty plf, both applied at
  the top of the railing. The total lateral force and total vertical  load
  shall be at least two hundred pounds each.
    (2)  Intermediate and bottom rails, if provided, shall be designed for
  the simultaneous application of forty plf applied horizontally and fifty
  plf applied vertically; however, lateral and vertical  design  loads  on
  intermediate  and  bottom  rails need not be considered in the design of
  posts and anchorages. For railings having solid panels, the panels shall
  be designed for a uniform lateral load of twenty psf.
    (3) Where railings or parapets support fixtures,  allowance  shall  be
  made for the additional loads imposed thereby.
    (4)  Railings,  bumpers,  or  similar devices used in parking areas to
  resist the impact of moving vehicles  shall  be  designed  to  resist  a
  lateral  load  of  three  hundred plf applied at least twenty-one inches
  above the  roadway;  but  in  no  case  shall  the  load  be  less  than
  twenty-five hundred pounds per vehicle.
