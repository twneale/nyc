Section 27-624

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-624  Construction  methods. (a) Fabrication. All timber shall be
  accurately cut and framed to a close fit  in  such  a  manner  that  the
  joints  will have even bearing over the contact surfaces. Mortises shall
  be true to size for their full depth and tenons  shall  fit  snugly.  No
  shimming in joints, or open joints, shall be permitted.
    (b) Erection.
    (1)  ASSEMBLY.  Joints  shall  have  a  tight  fit. Fasteners shall be
  installed in a manner that will not damage  the  wood.  End  compression
  joints  shall be brought to full bearing. All framework shall be carried
  up true and plumb.
    (2) TEMPORARY CONNECTIONS. As erection progresses, the work  shall  be
  bolted,  or  nailed  as  necessary,  to  resist all dead load, wind, and
  erection stresses.
    (3) ALIGNMENT. The structure shall be properly  aligned  before  final
  tightening of the connections.
