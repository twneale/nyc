Section 27-594

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-594  Combination  of  loads.  Dead  loads, live loads (including
  impact) and reduced live loads, where applicable, shall be considered as
  basic loads. Wind, earthquake, thermal forces, shrinkage, and  unreduced
  live loads (where live load reduction is permitted by subchapter nine of
  this  chapter)  shall  be  considered as loads of infrequent occurrence.
  Members  shall  have  adequate  capacity  to   resist   all   applicable
  combinations  of the loads listed in subchapter nine of this chapter, in
  accordance with the following:
    (a) Where design is based on allowable working stresses, the loads  as
  described  in subchapter nine of this chapter shall be multiplied by the
  following factors and the design shall be based on  the  resulting  load
  values:
    (1)  For  combinations  of basic loads, only, the factor shall be 1.0,
  except that for  the  design  of  temporary  structures  (defined  as  a
  structure which will be in place six months or less) the factor shall be
  0.75.
    (2)  For  any combination of one or more basic loads with any one load
  of infrequent occurrence, the factor shall be 0.75, except that for  the
  design of temporary structures the factor shall be 0.67.
    (3)  For  any  combination of one or more basic loads with two or more
  loads of infrequent occurrence, the factor shall be 0.67.
    Exception. The provisions of reference standards RS 10-8 and  RS  10-9
  relating  to increases of allowable unit stresses for short-time loading
  shall apply.
    (b) Where design is based on  ultimate  strength  criteria  (including
  plastic  design  of  steel  structures  and  proportioning  of suspended
  structures), the loads, as described in subchapter nine of this  chapter
  shall  be  multiplied  by  the  factors  indicated in subdivision (e) of
  section  27-639  of  article  eleven  of  this  subchapter  and  in  the
  applicable  reference  standards.  The  design  shall  be  based  on the
  resulting load values.
    Exceptions. 1. Where combinations of load for which factors are  given
  in  the  reference standard include the load of wind (or earthquake) the
  design additionally shall consider combinations  of  load  wherein  each
  other  of  the  loads of frequent occurrence as listed in this paragraph
  are substituted for the load of wind.
    2. The design also shall consider combinations  of  load  wherein  two
  most  critical  of  the loads of infrequent occurrence are combined with
  the basic loads. For such combination, however, the factors indicated in
  the reference standards and in subdivision  (e)  of  section  27-639  of
  article  eleven  of  this  subchapter  for suspended structures, for the
  combination of basic loads plus one load of infrequent occurrence may be
  reduced fifteen per cent.
