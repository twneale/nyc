Section 27-637

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-637 Tests of materials for bridge wire suspenders. The following
  minimum quantities of bridge wire for suspenders shall be tested:
    (1) Tensile strength tests of the wires shall be made  of  a  specimen
  cut from each coil of zinc coated wire.
    (2)  Tests  for  elongation  and  for  yield strength shall be made on
  samples from approximately ten percent of the  coils  of  any  one  size
  finished  wire.  If  any  of  these  tests  fail  to  meet the specified
  requirements, all the coils in that lot of finished wire shall be tested
  and only coils that satisfactorily pass the test shall be used.
    (3) Tests of the zinc coating shall  be  made  of  approximately  five
  percent  of  the coils of any one size of finished wire. If any of these
  tests fail to meet the specified requirements, all the coils in that lot
  of finished wire shall be tested and only coils that satisfactorily pass
  the test shall be used.
