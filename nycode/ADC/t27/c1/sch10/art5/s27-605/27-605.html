    &sect;  27-605  Mixes.  Concrete may be proportioned, batched, and mixed by
  any of the following methods:
    (a) Method I. Mixes with minimum cement content.
    (1) MINIMUM CEMENT CONTENT. The cement content used in the work  shall
  not  be  less than the content given in table 10-3 for the corresponding
  strength of concrete.
                                  TABLE 10-3
                           MINIMUM CEMENT CONTENT
  ________________________________________________________________________
         Specified Compressive             Minimum Pounds of Cement
         Strength in 28 Days              Per Cubic Yard of Concrete
            (f'c) - psi                        (all aggregates)
  ________________________________________________________________________
             3,000                                 540
             3,500                                 610
             4,000                                 660
             5,000                                 800
           Over 5,000                   Permitted only by reference
                                             standard RS 10-3
          6,000 and over              Permitted only by reference
                                             standard RS 10-3,
                                        "Special Requirements for
                                         High Strength Concrete."
 
  NOTE: Minimum pounds of cement may be reduced up to  8  percent  by  the
  addition of an accepted admixture.
 
    (2) WATER-CEMENT OR STRENGTH-CEMENT RATIO.
  Normal  weight  concrete  proportioned on the basis of preliminary tests
  shall be produced by using a water-cement ratio corresponding to a point
  on a strength-cement  or  water-cement  ratio  curve.  Proportioning  of
  lightweight  and  heavyweight  concrete, and concrete using an aggregate
  other  than  natural  sand,  gravel  or  stone  shall  be  by  using   a
  strength-cement content curve.  The point on the respective curves shall
  represent  a strength of concrete at the slump and age called for on the
  plans at least twenty-five percent higher than the  specified  strength,
  f'c.  The  cement  content  shall  not be less than the content shown in
  table 10-3.
    (3) PRELIMINARY TESTS. Preliminary tests of concrete shall be made  in
  advance  of  any  concreting  operation  by  a licensed concrete testing
  laboratory  acceptable  to  the  architect  or   engineer   of   record.
  Preliminary  tests shall consist of compression strength tests of molded
  concrete cylinders made in accordance with reference standards RS  10-17
  and  RS  10-21.  A  curve  representing the relation between the average
  strength of the concrete at twenty-eight days, or at any other specified
  age filed with the department, and  the  strength-cement  ratio  or  the
  water-cement ratio shall be established for the range of strength values
  at  the  slump  required  for the work. The tests shall include at least
  four mixes with different strength-cement  ratios  or  four  mixes  with
  different  water-cement  ratios and at least four cylinder specimens for
  each mix. The cylinder strength tests shall be supplemented by tests  to
  confirm  that  the  cement  and  aggregates conform to the provisions of
  reference standard RS 10-3.
    (4)  PREVIOUSLY  ACCEPTED  MIXES.  In  lieu  of  the  requirements  of
  paragraph   three   of  this  subdivision,  the  architect  or  engineer
  designated  for  controlled  inspection  may  permit  the  use  of   mix
  proportions  of  aggregates  having  the same specific gravity, size and
  gradation; cements of the same type and batch weight; admixtures of  the

  same  type  and  quantity; and other ingredients the same as or equal to
  those that have been previously submitted  with  applicable  preliminary
  tests  which  complied  with paragraphs one and two of this subdivision,
  and  which  have been accepted by the commissioner within the past year.
  If any of the mix proportions or ingredients  are  changed,  a  separate
  submission for acceptance shall be required.
    (5) QUALITY CONTROL AND INSPECTION OF MATERIALS AND OF BATCHING. Where
  concrete  materials  are used for structural elements defined in section
  27-585 of article one of this subchapter, quality control and inspection
  shall be provided at the batch plant  by  a  licensed  concrete  testing
  laboratory under the supervision of the architect or engineer designated
  for  controlled inspection, in accordance with the requirements of table
  10-1 and in sufficient scope to:
    a. Determine and record the actual batched weights of the  ingredients
  and the volume of water charged into the mixer;
    b.  Verify  that  such  weights conform to the weights and proportions
  required by the preliminary test mix,  adjusted  for  moisture  content,
  fineness modulus and gradation of aggregates;
    c. Verify conformance of the quality and condition of the materials to
  reference standard RS 10-3;
    d. Verify that the aggregates have the same specific gravity, size and
  gradation;  the cement is the same type and batch weight, the admixtures
  are the same type and quantity; and that any other ingredients  are  the
  same  as  or  equal to those used for the preparation of the preliminary
  test mixes;
    e.  For  all  concrete,  whether  or  not  designated  for  controlled
  inspection, attestation of the results of quality control and inspection
  at  the  batch  plant shall appear on a ticket accompanying each load of
  concrete. The attestation for subparagraphs  a,  b,  c  and  d  of  this
  paragraph shall be executed by the licensed concrete testing laboratory.
    f. The licensed concrete testing laboratory shall also attest that the
  slump  entrained  air  content and unit weight of the fresh concrete, as
  discharged from the mixer at the job site,  were  tested  in  accordance
  with  reference  standards  RS  10-49,  RS 10-51, RS 10-52, RS 10-61, RS
  10-62, RS 10-63 and RS 10-64, and that all were in compliance  with  the
  accepted mix design.
    (b) Method II. Proportioning on the basis of field experience.
    (1)  PROPORTIONING.  For  the computation of the standard deviation in
  accordance with reference standard RS 10-14, mixes with test  data  from
  previous   projects,  similarly  proportioned  in  accordance  with  the
  provisions of subdivision (a) of this section, and having  materials  of
  similar  density  and  admixtures and having a slump equal to or greater
  than that at which the concrete is to be  placed  shall  be  used.  Such
  mixes  may  be  accepted  subject  to  the  approval of the architect or
  engineer designated for controlled inspection.
    (2) STRENGTH. The required average strength, fcr, to be  used  as  the
  basis  for  the  selection  of mix proportions, shall in no case be less
  than fifteen percent higher than the specified strength  called  for  on
  the plans.
    (3)  BATCHING.  The  concrete shall be produced either in the concrete
  production facility used to produce the concrete from  which  the  tests
  were  made to develop the field experience data referred to in paragraph
  one of this subdivision or, subject to the approval of the architect  or
  engineer   designated   for   controlled  inspection,  in  any  concrete
  production facility that has data showing a record of standard deviation
  equal to or less than  that  of  the  original  facility.  All  concrete
  proportioned  according to field experience shall be produced in a plant
  with automatic recording equipment for all ingredients.

    (4) QUALITY CONTROL AND INSPECTION OF MATERIALS AND OF BATCHING.  When
  the  concrete  is batched in a plant where automatic recording equipment
  documents  the  batched  weights  or  volumes  of  cement,   aggregates,
  admixtures and water, no inspection of the materials or of the batching,
  nor   any   attestation   by  a  licensed  concrete  testing  laboratory
  responsible to the  architect  or  engineer  designated  for  controlled
  inspection, shall be required. A concrete producer shall:
    a.  Verify  that  such  weights  conform  to  the required weights and
  proportions, and to the  strength-cement  ratio  or  water-cement  ratio
  required  by  the proportioning established pursuant to paragraph one of
  this subdivision, adjusted for moisture content,  fineness  modules  and
  gradation of aggregates.
    b. Verify conformance of the quality and condition of the materials to
  reference standard RS 10-3.
    c.  Attest,  on  a  ticket  accompanying  each  load, to the specified
  strength  of  the  concrete,  the  actual  weights  or  volume  of   the
  ingredients, and the weight or volume of water charged into the mixer at
  the  batch  plant  or  to  be  added  at  the job site. A statement that
  subparagraph b of this paragraph has been complied with  shall  also  be
  included.
    d.   If   at  any  time  the  automatic  recording  equipment  becomes
  inoperative, the concrete production facility may be permitted, but only
  with the approval of the architect or engineer designated for controlled
  inspection, to batch and mix concrete for a period not to  exceed  three
  consecutive  working days. During such a period, the concrete production
  facility shall engage a concrete batch plant inspector from  a  licensed
  concrete  testing laboratory to observe and record the actual weights of
  the cement, aggregates, admixtures and other ingredients, and the weight
  or volume of water charged into the mixers. If the  automatic  recording
  equipment  is  inoperative  for  a  period longer than three consecutive
  working days the concrete production facility shall  not  batch  or  mix
  concrete  and  the  architect  or  engineer  designated  for  controlled
  inspection shall notify the commissioner in writing that such  equipment
  is inoperative.
 
    (c)  Method  III.  Average Concrete. (1) in lieu of making preliminary
  tests, average concrete limited to the concrete strengths shown in table
  10-3A below may be used, and the cement content shall not be  less  than
  the   value  given  in  table  10-3A  for  the  corresponding  specified
  compressive strengths, nor shall the total  volume  of  water  (moisture
  plus added water) exceed that specified therein, provided that the total
  yardage  placed  does  not  exceed  fifty  cubic yards and the levels of
  calculated stress do not exceed seventy percent of the  basic  allowable
  stresses.

  owner, whether produced at a ready mixed plant or site mixed, as to  the
  total  quantity of concrete, concrete strength and actual quantities per
  cubic yard of each material, including water, contained therein. A  copy
  of  such  certificate  shall  be  available to the department during the
  progress of the work and for two years thereafter.
