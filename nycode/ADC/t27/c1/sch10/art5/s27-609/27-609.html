Section 27-609

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 27-609 Licensed concrete testing laboratories. All strength tests of
  concrete and testing of concrete materials required by the provisions of
  this  section  shall  be  performed  by  concrete  testing  laboratories
  licensed  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  article  nine  of
  subchapter  two of chapter one of title twenty-six of the administrative
  code and rules promulgated by the commissioner.  The  licensed  concrete
  testing laboratory shall, among other things, analyze, evaluate and test
  concrete   materials;   determine  whether  the  materials  comply  with
  specifications and pertinent referenced national standards in  reference
  standard   RS  10-3;  select  mix  proportions  for  preliminary  tests;
  recommend the mix proportions to be used on the project  for  which  the
  tests  were  made;  analyze  data from previous projects and compute the
  standard deviation; and recommend the mix proportions to be  used  based
  on  such  field  experience data. At the batch plant or at the job site,
  the licensed concrete testing  laboratory  shall,  among  other  things,
  sample  concrete  and test for slump, entrained air content, unit weight
  and temperature, mold compression test specimens; store  and  cure  such
  specimens  on the job site; remove, transport and deliver such specimens
  to the laboratory; demold, store, cure, cap and test such  specimens  at
  the  laboratory  and furnish written reports of the results of all tests
  of the materials and concrete to the architect  or  engineer  designated
  for  controlled  inspection  and to the concrete producer. When tests of
  the hardened concrete are required, they shall be made by  the  licensed
  concrete  testing  laboratory  in  accordance with reference standard RS
  10-3 and  the  national  standards  for  making  tests  for  penetration
  resistance,  rebound  number, pullout strength and of drilled cores. The
  architect or engineer designated for controlled inspection is authorized
  either to dismiss or to employ a particular  licensed  concrete  testing
  laboratory at any time during the progress of the work.
