  included in the preliminary test mixes made in accordance with paragraph
  three  of  subdivision  (a)  of  section 27-605 or mixes proportioned in

  apply.  In  addition,  no  anti-freeze  agents shall be used. Admixtures
  shall be added in measured quantities in conformance with  the  accepted
  mix design.
