Section 27-613

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-613  Concrete utilizing preplaced aggregate. The use of concrete
  formed by the injection  of  grout  into  a  mass  of  preplaced  coarse
  aggregate  will  be permitted where it can be demonstrated by successful
  prototype installation that the proposed mix, materials, and  method  of
  placement  will produce a concrete of the specified strength and free of
  areas or inclusions of uncemented aggregate.
    (a) Prototypes. At least two prototypes, from either previous work  or
  samples  prepared  for the proposed project shall be prepared. The forms
  shall be stripped, and a minimum of six cores recovered  and  tested  to
  demonstrate  the  strength  of  the  concrete  produced  by the proposed
  materials and methods of installation. In addition, the  homogeneity  of
  the prototypes shall be demonstrated by demolishing the prototypes.
    (b)  In-place  concrete.  The concrete, as finally placed in the work,
  shall  be  prepared  using  the  same  materials,  mix,  equipment,  and
  procedures utilized to prepare the successful prototype installations.
    (c)  Inspection.  All preparation and placement of structural concrete
  utilizing  preplaced  aggregates  shall   be   subject   to   controlled
  inspection.  Compression  test specimens shall be prepared and tested as
  required for premixed concrete,  except  that  the  specimens  shall  be
  prepared  under conditions that will simulate the conditions under which
  the concrete in the work is installed.
