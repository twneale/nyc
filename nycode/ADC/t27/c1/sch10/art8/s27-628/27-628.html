  those for which the framework was designed.
    (b)  Temporary  connections. As erection progresses, the work shall be
  securely bolted, or welded, to resist all dead loads, wind, and erection
  stresses.
    (c)  Alignment.  The  structure  shall  be  properly  aligned   before
  riveting, permanent bolting, or welding is performed.
