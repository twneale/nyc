    &sect;  27-588  Use  of used and unidentified materials. The utilization of
  used materials and unidentified or ungraded materials shall  be  limited
  to non-structural elements, except:
    (a)  Such  materials (or elements) may be reused, or continued in use,
  at stress levels to which the materials or elements  were  subjected  in
  the  previous  construction, or at load capacity as demonstrated by load
  test procedures as described in subdivision (a)  of  section  27-599  of
  article three of this subchapter.
    (b)  Unidentified  materials may be graded by the recovery and test of
  representative  samples,  or  by  other  means   satisfactory   to   the
  commissioner.
    (c) Used materials shall be considered to be graded where the grade is
  clearly  indicated  on  the approved plans for the existing construction
  and may be used at the allowable stress levels for that  grade  of  like
  material  as  established  in the building code in force at the time the
  plans for the existing construction were approved.
