Section 27-590

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-590  Deferred  detailing. Where structural elements are normally
  detailed on shop or working drawings, the  application  for  the  permit
  shall  so  state,  and  issuance of the permit shall be conditioned upon
  future submission of such shop or working drawings showing the  approval
  of an architect or engineer with regard to such elements, or of a signed
  statement  by  an architect or engineer to the effect that such drawings
  were prepared to his or her satisfaction. In cases where  the  detailing
  of  structural  elements  has  been made on the basis of fire-resistance
  ratings, load  tables,  or  similar  data  as  given  in  manufacturer's
  catalogues, the application for approval of the plans shall so state and
  issuance  of  such  acceptance shall be conditional upon submission of a
  statement by  the  manufacturer,  or  of  other  supporting  documentary
  evidence  of  accreditation  furnished by the manufacturer, attesting to
  the accuracy of the data and stating that  such  data  were  derived  in
  conformance  with  the  provisions  of this code. Where the detailing of
  structural elements has been made on the  basis  of  data  published  in
  technical documents of recognized authority issued by, or accredited by,
  the agency or association promulgating the applicable reference standard
  cited in this code, such statements will not be required.
