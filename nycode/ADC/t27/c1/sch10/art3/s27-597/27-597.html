Section 27-597

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-597  Questionable construction. If, upon inspection, it is found
  that a construction or any part thereof, as built,  shows  open  cracks,
  spallings, or other signs of distress; or should inspection records show
  more  significant deficiency of construction; or should laboratory tests
  on concrete or other materials that have been incorporated into the work
  indicate deficiency of strength; or should there be a  reasonable  doubt
  as  to  the  strength, stability, or adequacy of the construction or any
  part thereof, such construction may be checked to  verify  the  adequacy
  thereof  either  by  computation,  or by core or load tests conducted in
  accordance with the provisions of section 27-598 or subdivision  (b)  of
  section  27-599  of  this  article or by any combination of these means.
  Should the adequacy of construction not be verified within a  reasonable
  time,  such  construction  shall  be rejected and shall be demolished or
  reinforced  or  rebuilt  to  be  made  safe  in  conformance  with   the
  requirements  of  this  code.  In the event of a disagreement, the final
  decision as to  the  acceptance  of  the  work  shall  be  made  by  the
  commissioner. All such tests shall be made without expense to the city.
