Section 27-599

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-599  Load tests. (a) Prequalifying load tests. The provisions of
  this section shall apply only to load tests  made  for  the  purpose  of
  establishing  the  structural  adequacy  of members or assemblies before
  such members or assemblies are incorporated into the  work.  Load  tests
  for  the purpose of establishing the strength of an element or assembly,
  in place, after construction,  shall  conform  to  the  requirements  of
  subdivision (b) of this section.
    (1)  TEST SPECIMENS. The test specimens shall be a true representation
  of the units or assemblies to be used in the work and, unless sufficient
  tests  are  conducted  on  differing  specimens   to   interpolate   the
  performance  of members of varying characteristics, test specimens shall
  be substantially identical with the units or assemblies to  be  used  in
  service.  Particular  attention  shall be given to matching the type and
  grade of material and, in the case of concrete, the  mix,  age,  curing,
  and other pertinent variables.
    (2)  SUPPORT CONDITIONS AND INTERACTION. Load tests shall be performed
  in such a manner that the supports for the members or  assemblies  being
  tested  will  simulate the conditions of support in the building, except
  that conditions of partial fixity may be approximated  by  condition  of
  full  or  zero  restraint,  whichever  produces  a  more  severe  stress
  condition in the member being tested. The test conditions shall be  such
  as  to obviate all interaction of fills, finishes, partitions, supports,
  or members whose interaction normally  would  be  neglected  in  design.
  Where  continuous, multiple, intersecting, or connected members are used
  in the test, all interacting members shall be simultaneously  and  fully
  loaded and additional tests shall be performed under the partial loading
  conditions  specified in subchapter nine of this chapter. Test specimens
  shall not be unloaded and reloaded or  subjected  to  cyclical  loading,
  except  as  specifically  required  by  the  provisions of this code and
  except that the adding of increments of  additional  load  to  a  member
  already  under load and the application of the test load as described in
  subparagraph b of paragraph three of this subdivision following  removal
  of  the test load described in subparagraph a of paragraph three of this
  subdivision will be permitted.
    (3) STRENGTH  REQUIREMENTS.  The  member  or  assembly,  supported  as
  described  in  paragraph  two  of  this subdivision, shall be capable of
  supporting:
    a. Without visible damage (other than hairline cracks) its own  weight
  plus  a test load equal to one hundred fifty per cent of the design live
  load plus one hundred fifty per cent of any dead load that will be added
  at the site; and
    b. Without collapse, its own weight plus a test load  equal  to  fifty
  per cent of its own weight plus two hundred fifty per cent of the design
  live  load plus two hundred fifty per cent of any dead load that will be
  added at the site. The latter  loading  shall  remain  in  place  for  a
  minimum  period  of  one  week.  All  loading  conditions  described  in
  subchapter nine of this chapter shall be  considered.  The  design  live
  load  shall  be  the  nominal  value  reduced  for  contributory area as
  described in subchapter nine. Except as permitted under  paragraph  five
  of this subdivision, units to be tested shall be full size. Load bearing
  wall  and  partition  assemblies  shall  be tested both with and without
  window and door framing where such framing will be included in the final
  assemblies.
    Exception. If the load tests are conducted and the results promulgated
  in a manner that will permit clear differentiation between the dead  and
  live  load components added at the site, then the capacity of the member
  or assembly  without  visible  damage  other  than  hairline  cracks  as
  determined  under  load  test  condition  in subparagraph a of paragraph

  three of this subdivision, may be reduced to the weight of  the  member,
  plus  any  dead  load  that  will be added at the site, plus one hundred
  fifty per cent of the design live load; and the capacity of  the  member
  or  assembly  to resist collapse as determined under load test condition
  in subparagraph b of paragraph three of this subdivision may be  reduced
  to  one  hundred  fifty  per  cent of the weight of the member, plus one
  hundred fifty per cent of any dead load that will be added at the  site,
  plus two hundred fifty per cent of the design live load.
    (4)  DEFLECTION  REQUIREMENT. With the member or assembly supported as
  described in paragraph two of this subdivision,  and  after  loading  as
  required  by the provisions of subparagraph a of paragraph three of this
  subdivision and the removal of said load, the percentage of recovery  of
  the  deflection  caused  by  the  superimposed  load  shall  be at least
  seventy-five per cent. The deflection under the design live  load  shall
  not exceed that permitted in this subchapter.
    (5)  MODEL  TESTS.  Tests on models less than full size may be used to
  determine  the  relative  intensity,  direction,  and  distribution   of
  stresses  and  applied  loads,  but  shall not be considered as a proper
  method for evaluating stresses  in,  nor  the  strength  of,  individual
  members  unless  approved  by  the  commissioner for this purpose. Where
  model analysis is proposed as a means  of  establishing  the  structural
  design, the following conditions shall be met:
    a.  Analysis  shall be made by a firm or a corporation satisfactory to
  the commissioner.
    b. The similitude, scaling, and validity  of  the  analysis  shall  be
  attested to by an officer or principal of the firm or corporation making
  the analysis.
    c.  A  report on the analysis shall be submitted showing test set-ups,
  equipment, and readings.
    (b) Load tests of  completed  construction.  The  provisions  of  this
  subdivision   shall   apply  to  any  type  of  construction  where  the
  appropriate reference  standard  does  not  provide  for  load  test  of
  completed  construction  and  the construction is questionable. When the
  appropriate reference standard  provides  for  such  load  testing,  the
  provisions of reference standard shall be used.
    (1) Strength. The construction shall be loaded in two stages:
    (a) With all dead load to which it will be subjected in service plus a
  superimposed  load equal to the design live load reduced as described in
  subchapter nine of this chapter; and
    (b) With a total load, including its own weight, equal to one  hundred
  fifty  per  cent  of the total dead load to be supported in service plus
  one hundred eighty per  cent  of  the  design  live  load,  reduced  for
  contributory area as described in subchapter nine of this chapter, which
  load shall remain in place for a minimum period of twenty-four hours.
    (2)  Deflection  requirement.  Under  the  first  stage  loading,  the
  deflection shall not exceed that permitted in the  applicable  reference
  standard.  The  residual  deflection  after  removal of the second stage
  loading shall not exceed twenty-five per cent of the calculated  elastic
  deflection  under  the  superimposed  test  load.  The  structure, after
  recovery of the deflection  shall  not  show  any  evidence  of  serious
  distress.
    (3)  Interaction. The load area shall extend to include the loading of
  all framing and elements that contribute to the strength of the  element
  or elements under test, by way of interaction.
    (4)  Lateral loads. Where the elements in question must resist lateral
  loads in service, such loads shall be simulated in the  tests.  In  such
  case, the magnitude of the applied live load and lateral load components
  of  the  test  load  may  be  adjusted as described in section 27-594 of

  article two of this subchapter, provided that the stress condition under
  the load increments described in paragraph one of  this  subdivision  is
  not more critical.
    (5)  Reloading.  Unloading  and  reloading or cyclical loading of test
  areas will not be permitted, except for the addition  of  increments  of
  additional load to a member already under load.
