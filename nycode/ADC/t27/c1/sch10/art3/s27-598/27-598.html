Section 27-598

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-598  Core  tests  of  concrete construction. The adequacy of the
  concrete in a building may be ascertained by the recovery and testing of
  cores. Cores shall be taken and tested in accordance with the  procedure
  described  in  reference  standard  RS  10-16.  In  lieu  thereof, cores
  cast-in-place and originally cured with the parent  concrete,  or  other
  device acceptable to the architect or engineer designated for controlled
  inspection   and  which  will  produce  test  specimens  simulating  the
  condition of the concrete in place including the  size  and  proportions
  specified for core specimens may be utilized to demonstrate the adequacy
  of  the  concrete in place. The compressive strength so determined shall
  meet the requirements for  strength  tests  as  described  in  reference
  standard RS 10-3.
