Section 27-596

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-596 General. The structural design of a member or assembly shall
  be  deemed  to  be  adequate  if  the  design  computations  demonstrate
  conformance with the applicable standards noted in articles four through
  twelve  of  this  subchapter.  Where, because of practical difficulties,
  such computations cannot be  executed,  the  structural  design  may  be
  deemed  adequate  if  the  member  or  assembly  is  subjected  to,  and
  satisfactorily  performs  under,  load  tests  in  accordance  with  the
  provisions  of  subdivision (a) of section 27-599 of this article. Where
  there is a question  as  to  the  adequacy  of  a  completed  or  partly
  completed  construction,  the provisions of sections 27-597, 27-598, and
  subdivision (b) of section 27-599 of this article shall apply.
