Section 27-248

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-248  Classification. Buildings and spaces shall be classified in
  the mercantile occupancy group when they are used for display and  sales
  of   goods  accessible  to  public  inspection.  Highly  combustible  or
  flammable goods, such as those made  of  pyroxylin  products,  shall  be
  limited to small quantities that do not constitute a high hazard; if not
  so  limited,  the  occupancy shall meet the requirements for high hazard
  occupancies when the latter are more restrictive than the  corresponding
  requirements for the mercantile classification.
