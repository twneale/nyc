    &sect;  27-268  Classification.  When  a  building  or space is used for an
  occupancy not specifically provided  for  in  this  code,  or  when  its
  classification  is  otherwise uncertain, such building or space shall be
  included in the occupancy group  that  it  most  nearly  resembles  with
  respect  to  the existing or proposed life and fire hazard, and it shall
  be so classified by the architect or engineer subject to the approval of
  the commissioner.
