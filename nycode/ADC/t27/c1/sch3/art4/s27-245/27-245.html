Section 27-245

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-245  Classification. Buildings and spaces shall be classified in
  the storage occupancy group when they are  used  primarily  for  storing
  goods.    When  the  goods  stored are highly combustible, flammable, or
  potentially explosive, the building or space shall meet the requirements
  for high hazard occupancies when the latter are  more  restrictive  than
  the  corresponding  requirements  for  the  storage  classification. The
  storage occupancy group consists of sub groups B-1 and B-2.
