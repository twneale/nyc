Section 27-271

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;   27-271   Classification  table.  The  fire-resistance  ratings  of
  construction elements in hours listed in table 3-4 shall be  used  as  a
  basis   for   classifying   buildings   and   spaces   by  construction.
  Fire-resistance ratings  shall  be  based  on  the  test  procedures  of
  reference  standard RS3-1 and shall apply to all occupancy groups except
  as  specifically  noted.  For   hazardous   occupancies   involving   an
  exceptionally  high  degree  of  fire  risk  or  an  exceptionally  high
  concentration of combustible or flammable contents, the commissioner may
  increase the requirements of table 3-4.
 
             (For Table 3-4 see chapter 839 of the laws of 1986)
 
  Notes:
    a. The area of openings permitted in exterior walls at any story shall
  be obtained by multiplying the percentage shown  in  the  table  by  the
  exterior  separation distance in feet, and then multiplying that product
  by the square-foot area of the facade of that  story.  Requirements  for
  protected  exterior openings shall not apply to churches or to buildings
  classified in occupancy groups  J-2  and  J-3.  See  section  27-331  of
  article   four  of  subchapter  five  of  this  chapter  for  additional
  requirements for exterior walls and exterior wall openings.
    b. Upon special application, the commissioner may permit exterior wall
  openings to be constructed in excess of the permitted  area  established
  by  table  3-4  if  such  openings at the time of their construction are
  located at least sixty feet  in  a  direct  line  from  any  neighboring
  building  except  as  otherwise permitted by footnote f. Such additional
  openings may not,  however,  be  credited  toward  meeting  any  of  the
  mandatory natural light or ventilation requirements of subchapter twelve
  of  chapter  one  of  this  title.  If any neighboring building is later
  altered or constructed to come within the above distance limitation, the
  affected exterior openings shall immediately be closed with construction
  meeting  the  fire-resistance  rating  requirements  for  exterior  wall
  construction of the building in which they are located.
    c. Applies to occupancy groups A, B-1, B-2, and D-1.
    d. Applies  to  all  occupancy  groups  other  than those described in
  footnote c.
    e. See subdivision (i) of section 27-375 of article five of subchapter
  six of  this  chapter  for  additional  impact  resistance  requirements
  applicable  to  certain  stair  enclosures and for certain exceptions to
  stair enclosure requirements.
    f. When two or more buildings are constructed on the same lot, and the
  combined floor area of the buildings does not exceed the  limits  estab-
  lished  by  tables  4-1  and  4-2  for  any  one  of  the  buildings, no
  fire-resistance rating shall be required for nonbearing portions of  the
  exterior  walls of those buildings facing each other, and there shall be
  no limitation on the permitted amount of exterior openings.
    g. Fire retardant treated wood  complying  with  the  requirements  of
  section  27-328  of article three of subchapter five of this chapter may
  be used.
    h. Tabulated ratings apply to buildings over one story in  height.  In
  one  story  buildings roof construction may be of material having 0 hour
  fire-resistance rating.
    i. Materials which are not noncombustible, as  defined  in  subchapter
  two of chapter one of this title, may be used in nonbearing construction
  elements if they fall into one of the following categories:
    1. Materials  having  a  structural base of noncombustible material as
  defined in subchapter two, and having a surface not over one-eighth inch

  thick which when tested in accordance with the provisions  of  reference
  standard RS 3-2 has a flame spread rating not higher than fifty.
    2. Materials  which  when  tested in accordance with the provisions of
  reference standard RS 3-2 have a surface flame spread rating not  higher
  than  twenty-five  without evidence of continued progressive combustion,
  and which are of such composition that surfaces which would  be  exposed
  by cutting through the material in any way would not have a flame spread
  rating higher than twenty-five without evidence of continued progressive
  combustion.
    j. Applies   to   the   construction  of  the  street  floor  and  all
  construction below the level of the street floor in buildings or  spaces
  classified  in  occupancy  group  J-2  except  where the space below the
  street floor does not exceed five feet in height.
    k. Columns supporting the roof of a one-story building shall have  the
  same  fire-resistance  rating  as  required  for a column supporting one
  floor in a building of the same construction class.
    l. Members supporting loads of not more than two floors or  one  floor
  and a roof need not have a fire-resistance rating greater than the floor
  construction  fire-resistance  requirement  in  buildings  classified in
  occupancy groups G, H, and J-2, not including  unsprinklered  spaces  of
  other  occupancies,  and  in  fully  sprinklered  buildings in occupancy
  groups E and J-1.
    m. See subdivision (c) of section 27-987 of article one of  subchapter
  eighteen  of  this chapter for additional impact resistance requirements
  applicable to certain elevator enclosures.
