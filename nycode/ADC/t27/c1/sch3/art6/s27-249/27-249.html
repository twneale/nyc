Section 27-249

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-249  Classification. Buildings and spaces shall be classified in
  the industrial occupancy group  when  they  are  used  for  fabricating,
  assembling, manufacturing, or processing products, materials, or energy,
  except  that  when  any  products  or  materials,  or  other products or
  materials used in their manufacture are highly  combustible,  flammable,
  or  explosive, the occupancy shall meet the requirements for high hazard
  occupancies when the latter are more restrictive than the  corresponding
  requirements for the industrial classification. The industrial occupancy
  group consists of sub groups D-1 and D-2.
