Section 27-951

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-951 Inspections and tests. (a) Inspections. Every new system and
  every part of an existing system that is altered,  extended,  renovated,
  or  repaired,  except  for  ordinary  repairs,  shall  comply  with  the
  applicable requirements of this subchapter.
    (b)  Notification.  Advance  notification  of  tests  and  inspections
  required by this section shall be given to the commissioner.
    (c)  Representation  at  test. Tests required by this section shall be
  conducted in the presence of the commissioner or his or  her  authorized
  representative, or in lieu thereof, the commissioner may accept a signed
  statement  of an architect or engineer, whose name is submitted with the
  notification in subdivision (b) of this section, declaring  that  he  or
  she  has  witnessed  the  tests  and that the standpipe system meets the
  requirements of this code. If a representative of the commissioner  does
  not  appear  within  two  days  after  receipt  of  such  report  by the
  commissioner,  the  report  shall  be  deemed  to  be  accepted  by  the
  commissioner.
    (d)  Testing  equipment  required.  All equipment, material, and labor
  required for testing a system or part thereof shall be furnished by, and
  at the expense of, the person responsible for installing the work.
    (e) Testing of system. Systems may be tested in sections, or parts, in
  accordance with the requirements of this subchapter.
    (f) Acceptance. Before the acceptance  of  such  system,  each  system
  shall be subjected to the tests required by this section.
    (g) Standpipe system tests.
    (1) PRESSURE TESTS.
    a.  The  test  shall  demonstrate  that  the  system  will  sustain  a
  hydrostatic pressure of at least one hundred psig, and  at  least  three
  hundred  psig  at  the  siamese connection, for a period of at least one
  hour at the topmost hose outlet and  at  the  lowest  fire  pump  supply
  connection  to  the  system. In buildings not exceeding three stories or
  forty feet in height, the test pressures need not  be  more  than  fifty
  psig.  in excess of the normal hydrostatic pressures at the topmost hose
  outlet, and this pressure must be maintained for a period  of  at  least
  one hour.
    b.  Pressure  tanks  shall  be  tested  to  demonstrate that they will
  sustain a hydrostatic pressure of at least one hundred fifty per cent of
  the normal maximum required operating pressure for a period of at  least
  one hour.
    (2) FLOW TEST. The system shall be flow tested to determine that water
  is  available at the top outlet of each riser, the lowest outlet in each
  riser, and through each siamese connection. The system shall be  flushed
  to  remove  all foreign matter from the system. Flow shall be through at
  least a two and one-half inch hose without nozzle at  each  one  of  the
  above mentioned locations at separate times.
    (3) ALTERATION TESTS. When alterations, additions, or repairs are made
  to  a  standpipe  system,  the  entire  system  shall  be subjected to a
  hydrostatic test pressure of at least fifty psig  at  the  highest  hose
  outlet,  and  in  addition,  a  flow  test  shall  be  made as stated in
  paragraph two of this subdivision through the new or altered portion  of
  the system.
    (h) Pump tests.
    (1)  Fire  pumps  shall be tested at the factory, and a certified test
  curve shall be furnished with each pump.
    (2) Pumps shall be tested after installation  to  ascertain  that  the
  pump is supplying its rated capacity at the highest required hose outlet
  or through the roof manifold. The test shall be performed as follows:
    a.  At least fifty feet of approved two and one-half inch rubber lined
  hose equipped with a one and one-eighth inch nozzle shall  be  connected

  to  the  highest  two  and one-half inch hose outlet valve. One of these
  assemblies shall be connected in parallel for each two hundred fifty gpm
  of rated pump capacity.
    b.  The  nozzle or nozzles of the hose assembly shall discharge at, or
  above, the highest required hose outlet or through a manifold.
    c. Pitot tube  gauge  readings  shall  be  taken  at  each  nozzle  to
  determine that the required pump capacity is being discharged.
    d.  For  manually  operated  fire  pumps,  the  suction  and discharge
  pressures shall be recorded for each step or pump speed.  The  pump  rpm
  electrical  current,  and  voltage  readings  shall be recorded with the
  specific discharge pressure for each supply condition.
    e. Automatic fire pumps shall be tested to ascertain that all  of  the
  automatic controls are in good working order.
    f.  All of the above readings shall be noted on the required standpipe
  diagram or a framed chart, which shall be mounted in a visible  location
  near the pump control panel.
    g. When pumps are supplied by two independent services, the test shall
  be  conducted  from  each  service  independent  of  the  other  and, in
  addition, with both services supplying the pump.
    (i) Test equipment for fire pumps.
    (1) For every fire pump installation, there shall be provided for test
  purposes at least three fifty foot lengths of approved two and  one-half
  inch  rubber  lined  fire  hose.  Hose shall be hung in the pump room or
  other convenient location.
    (2) Three two and one-half inch by one and  one-eighth  inch  nozzles,
  three  spanner  wrenches,  and  twelve  washers shall be stored with the
  required hose.
