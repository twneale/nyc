Section 27-934

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-934 Standpipe systems in structures being erected or demolished.
  (a) During construction or demolition  of  any  structure  for  which  a
  standpipe  system  is  required,  provision shall be made for the use of
  such standpipe by the fire department in accordance with the  provisions
  of  section  27-1014  of  article  one  of  subchapter nineteen and this
  subchapter.
    (b) Temporary risers shall be at least four  inches  in  diameter  for
  structures  less  than  four  hundred  fifty  feet high and at least six
  inches in diameter for structures four hundred fifty feet high or  more.
  There  shall  be  as  many  risers as will be, or were, required for the
  permanent system.  Each  such  riser  shall  be  connected  to  a  cross
  connection  that  is  supplied  through  siamese hose connections at the
  street level, and shall be  equipped  on  each  floor  with  a  two  and
  one-half inch hose outlet valve. The installations shall be made so that
  each  riser,  cross-connection, and branch line can be plugged or capped
  when work is not being done on the system. The location of  the  siamese
  hose  connection  shall  be  placarded,  kept free from obstruction, and
  identified by a red light.
