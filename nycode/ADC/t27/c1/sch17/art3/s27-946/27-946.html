Section 27-946

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-946  Fire  pumps.  (a) Additional water supply. Additional water
  supply shall be provided for standpipes in buildings over three  hundred
  feet  high.  The  primary  water supply to the standpipe system shall be
  supplemented by one or more manually operated fire pumps as follows:
    (1) Standpipe systems in buildings more than three hundred  feet  high
  shall have at least one seven hundred fifty gpm pump or two five hundred
  gpm  pumps. Pumps shall be capable of delivering their rated capacity at
  a pressure of fifty psig above the  normal  static  pressure  determined
  from  the highest hose outlet (except the roof manifold) in the building
  plus the frictional resistance through the pipe from  the  pump  to  the
  outlet.
    (2)  Where  a  group  of  two  or more buildings, whether connected or
  separated, are operated  under  a  single  ownership  and  one  or  more
  buildings  exceed  three  hundred feet in height, one fire pump shall be
  accepted as the supplemental supply for the group.  The  pump  shall  be
  installed  in  the building where the maintenance personnel are located,
  and a metal sign with one inch lettering  shall  be  installed  in  each
  building at all of the hose outlets on the entrance floor indicating the
  location of the fire pump.
    (b) Standpipe pump rooms and location.
    (1)  Fire  pumps  shall  be  installed  at the entrance floor level or
  below, in rooms enclosed by noncombustible  construction  having  a  two
  hour  fire-resistance rating and that are adequately heated, ventilated,
  lighted, and drained. The pump room shall  have  access  to  the  street
  level  by a direct opening to a street or a court, or by a passageway or
  stairway having a fire-resistance rating of at least two hours.
    (2) No person shall install other machinery or mechanical equipment in
  a fire pump room, unless the building is of construction class  IA,  IB,
  or IC.
    (3)  No  person  shall  place  or  install  any equipment containing a
  refrigerant classified in groups A1, A2, A3, B1, B2 or B3 in  subchapter
  thirteen  of  this  chapter,  or  place  or  install  gas  piping or gas
  consuming devices or any other equipment within any space housing a fire
  pump that would create a hazardous condition.
    (c) Power supply for standpipe fire pumps. The type of fire  pump  and
  prime  mover  used  in  a  standpipe  system  shall  be suitable for the
  required service in a standpipe system provided for fire department use.
  If the prime mover employs any form of  power  other  than  an  electric
  current  supplied  by a public utility, the use thereof shall be subject
  to the approval of the commissioner. Electrical power to the motor shall
  be taken from the street side of the house service switch.
    (d) Combined use of fire pumps for standpipe and  automatic  sprinkler
  systems.  A fire pump that furnishes the required auxiliary water supply
  either to a standpipe system or to an automatic sprinkler  system  shall
  be  accepted  as  furnishing the corresponding water supply to the other
  system if such pump is in the same premises, provided that in every such
  case of combined use,  suitable  relief  and  shutoff  valves  shall  be
  installed so as to prevent the water pressure on the automatic sprinkler
  system  resulting  from  any  required  operation  of  the  pump for the
  standpipe system from becoming greater  than  one  hundred  seventy-five
  psig.
