Section 27-933

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;   27-933  Yard  hydrant  systems  required.  Outdoor  amusement  and
  exhibition places, oil storage  plants,  lumber  yards,  trailer  camps,
  industrial  parks,  and  similar  occupancies  shall  have yard hydrants
  installed so that the entire area may be reached by  two  hundred  fifty
  feet  of  hose  from  a yard hydrant or a street hydrant. Single hydrant
  connection shall be at least in six inch I.P.S. Such hydrants  shall  be
  directly  connected  with  city  water  main  or  private water main, or
  supplied from gravity tanks or  pressure  tanks,  as  provided  in  this
  subchapter.
    (a)  Where  the  area  of  such  enclosure is more than forty thousand
  square feet and where the available city water service is less than that
  specified in paragraph one of subdivision (b) of section 27-945 of  this
  article, the yard hydrant system shall be supplied as follows:
    (1) A gravity tank of at least fifty thousand gallon capacity shall be
  provided  and  elevated  so  that  the  bottom  of  the tank is at least
  seventy-five feet  above  the  highest  grade  elevation  and  at  least
  twenty-five feet above the highest building in the area supplied by this
  tank.
    (2)  In  lieu  of  paragraph  one  of this subdivision, there shall be
  provided a manual fire pump with a capacity of  at  least  one  thousand
  gpm,  and a suction tank of at least fifty thousand gallon capacity. The
  suction tank shall be supplied through a six inch connection to the city
  water main controlled by an automatic ball float valve  in  the  suction
  tank.  A  bypass  shall be provided so that the pump may be fed directly
  from the city water main.
    (3) The pump shall be located in a pump house at the street main  side
  of the area or enclosure.
    (4)  Suction from a river or well may be permitted by the commissioner
  if the required quantity of reasonably clean fresh water may be obtained
  thereby, subject to the approvals of such other authorities as may  have
  jurisdiction over the primary source of supply.
    (b)  The  maximum distance between hydrants shall be two hundred fifty
  feet. At each yard hydrant, two hundred fifty feet of rubber lined hose,
  with a smooth bore one and one-eighth inch approved play-pipe, shall  be
  placed  in  a  hose  house painted red, and the words "Fire Hose" in six
  inch white letters shall be painted on the door.
    (c) The approval of the fire department shall be obtained for location
  of any monitor  nozzles  that  may  be  required  in  addition  to  yard
  hydrants.  Not  more than one monitor nozzle with remote control will be
  required for each forty thousand square feet of area or fraction thereof
  unless, in the fire department's opinion, an unusual hazard exists.
    (d) Standpipes and sprinkler  systems  may  be  connected  to  a  yard
  hydrant system in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter.
    (e)  Yard  hydrant  systems  connected  to  city  water mains shall be
  provided with post indicator valves located in an  accessible  position.
  Post indicator valves shall be locked open and be painted red.
    (f)  Fire  extinguishing  equipment, in addition to that prescribed by
  this section, shall be  provided  in  accordance  with  requirements  of
  chapter  four  of this title for oil storage plants, oil refineries, and
  other plants deemed by the fire commissioner  to  present  unusual  fire
  hazards,  and  also in rooms or spaces housing electrical equipment when
  such fire extinguishing equipment is deemed necessary.
