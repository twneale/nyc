Section 27-947

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-947 Direct connections of standpipes to the public water system.
  (a) Control valve. Each service directly supplying a standpipe system or
  a fire pump shall be equipped with a control  valve  located  under  the
  sidewalk  in  a flush sidewalk box located within two feet of the street
  line, or in such other locations as may be approved by the department of
  environmental protection. The purpose of each such control  valve  shall
  be  clearly  indicated  by the words "Standpipe Supply Control," cast in
  the cover of such flush sidewalk box or, in lieu thereof, a  metal  sign
  with  one  inch lettering shall be located on the exterior building wall
  indicating the use and location of the valve.
    (b) Water supply to standpipe fire pumps.
    (1) Any required manual or automatic fire pump  shall  draw  from  two
  independent  street  water  mains in different streets, except that: (i)
  any manual or automatic fire  pump  serving  a  building  classified  in
  occupancy  group  J-2  that  is fully protected by a system of automatic
  sprinklers may draw from a single water main; and (ii) an automatic fire
  pump may draw from a single water main if augmented by a suction tank or
  tanks, and if the valves at the meter and pump are provided with  tamper
  switches  that  are wired to an approved central station of an operating
  fire alarm company. Where two services are installed, one  service  from
  the  street  water main shall be run directly to the pump, and the other
  service may be used for domestic water supply. The connection from water
  mains to the pumps shall be at least six inch pipe  size  and  shall  be
  flushed before connection is made to the system. Connections shall be in
  accordance with subchapter sixteen of this chapter.
    (2)  In  the  event that two separate and distinct water mains are not
  available as a supply or the street mains cannot  produce  the  required
  supply,  there  shall  be  provided  a  suction tank, or tanks, suitably
  located and of sufficient capacity to furnish  the  fire  pump  with  at
  least a one-half hour supply at the rated capacity of such pump. Suction
  tanks  shall  be  filled  by  a  six  inch connection to the water main,
  controlled by an automatic ball float valve in the suction tank.  A  six
  inch bypass shall be provided so that pumps may be fed directly from the
  street water main.
    (3)  When  a  water service supplies both the domestic service and the
  manual fire pump, a remote control valve shall be placed on the domestic
  service connection at the point where such connection is taken from  the
  city  supply  or  service  main.  Such  remote  control  valve  shall be
  controlled from a point near the pump control panel. In lieu of a remote
  control valve, a manually operated valve may be installed  to  shut  off
  the entire domestic water supply to the building, provided such valve is
  located in the fire pump room and is properly tagged for identification.
