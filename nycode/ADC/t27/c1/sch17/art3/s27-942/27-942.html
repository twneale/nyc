Section 27-942

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 27-942 Hose stations. (a) Hose outlet valves.
    (1) At the riser on each floor served by the riser and on the entrance
  floor above the riser control valve, a two and one-half inch hose outlet
  valve  shall be provided for fire department use. Such hose outlet valve
  shall be readily accessible from a stairway landing or from a floor, and
  shall be located between five feet and six feet  above  the  landing  or
  floor.
    (2) At the top of the highest riser, there shall be provided above the
  main  roof  level,  a  three-way  manifold  equipped  with three two and
  one-half inch hose valves with hose valve caps. Where  the  manifold  is
  located  other  than  within  a  heated stair enclosure or bulkhead, the
  control valve shall be located in a horizontal run of piping  below  the
  roof.
    (b)  Location.  Hose stations shall be located at the standpipe risers
  located either within a stair enclosure or adjacent to the  entrance  to
  such  enclosure  as provided in section 27-936 of this article. When the
  hose station is located outside the stair enclosure  and  the  riser  is
  within  the  stair  enclosure,  it  shall be known as and referred to as
  "Auxiliary Hose Station".
    (1) Hose stations shall be located so that every point  in  the  floor
  area  served by the hose station is within twenty feet of the end of the
  hose nozzle with the hose in its extended position. The  maximum  length
  of  hose  that  shall  be  permitted  at any hose station is one hundred
  twenty-five feet.
    (c) Size, type and quality of hose. Hose shall  be  provided  on  hose
  racks at each hose station as follows:
    (1) Hose shall be one and one-half inch "flax-line" unlined linen hose
  or  equivalent,  factory coupled, in occupancy groups C, E, F, G, H, and
  J.
    (2) Hose shall be two and one-half inch cotton, rubber-line, or rubber
  hose or equivalent, factory coupled, in occupancy group A.
    (3) Hose shall be two and one-half inch "flax-line" unlined linen hose
  or equivalent, factory coupled, for occupancy groups other than those in
  paragraphs one and two of this subdivision.
    (4) Hose for auxiliary hose stations shall be one  and  one-half  inch
  "flax-line" unlined hose or equivalent.
    (5)  Hose  lines  shall  be made up of fifty foot factory coupled hose
  except that required hose lengths of less than fifty feet  shall  be  in
  one section of the required length. Only one length less than fifty feet
  will  be  permitted  where  hose  length  is  not  of  equal  fifty foot
  increments, and no length shall be less than twenty-five feet.
    (6) Hose may be omitted from hose racks in occupancy  groups  J-1  and
  J-2 whenever at least three open nozzles, two one and one-half inch, and
  two  two and one-half inch spanner wrenches, two two and one-half by one
  and one-half  inch  non-swivel  reducing  couplings  and  three  hundred
  seventy-five  feet  of  one  and  one-half  inch  hose  are  stored  and
  maintained in a locked cabinet located on the main entrance floor  in  a
  location  near  the standpipe riser enclosure subject to the approval of
  the commissioner, and hose valves are  capped  with  a  hose  valve  cap
  fastened  to  the  valve  with  a  chain. The person responsible for the
  maintenance of the standpipe system shall maintain on the premises a key
  for unlocking the storage cabinet. The key shall be kept in  a  location
  where  it  is readily available to authorized persons, but not available
  to the general public. A sign shall be placed  on  the  storage  cabinet
  indicating  the location of the key. An additional labelled key shall be
  kept in a locked receptacle near the storage cabinet openable by a  fire
  department  standard  key.  Such  receptacle  shall  be marked "For Fire
  Department Use Only." A  metal  sign  shall  be  placed  in  each  stair

  enclosure  on  the main entrance floor stating clearly where the storage
  cabinet is located.
    (7) Hose may be omitted from hose racks for nonautomatic dry standpipe
  systems  provided that the hose outlet valves are capped with hose valve
  caps which are chained to the valves.
    (d) Auxiliary hose stations.
    (1) Auxiliary hose stations may  be  installed  in  those  occupancies
  where   one  and  one-half  inch  hose  is  permitted  as  specified  in
  subdivision (c) of this section.
    (2) When auxiliary hose stations are installed, the required  two  and
  one-half  inch  hose valve at the riser shall be installed and the valve
  shall be equipped with a cap fastened to the valve with a chain.
