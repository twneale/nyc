Section 27-964

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-964  Sprinkler  booster  pumps. Where the pressure from the city
  water main is insufficient to comply with the  requirements  of  section
  27-963  of  this article but is sufficient to give at least five psig at
  the highest line of sprinklers as  determined  by  test,  an  automatic,
  electrically  driven  pump  installed  for  the  purpose  of boosting or
  increasing the city water  pressure  in  the  sprinkler  system  may  be
  accepted subject to the following requirements:
    (a) Pumps shall be of approved centrifugal type, capable of delivering
  at  least two hundred gpm, and shall be capable of supplying twenty-five
  per cent of the heads, in the largest area supplied, at twenty gpm, at a
  pressure of at  least  twenty-five  psig  at  the  top  of  the  highest
  sprinkler riser.
    (b)  Pumps  shall  be maintained under approved automatic control with
  closed circuit supervisory attachment. The supervisory attachments shall
  be directly connected to an office where maintenance  personnel  are  in
  attendance twenty-four hours a day; or, in lieu thereof, the supervisory
  attachment  may  be  directly  connected  to  the  central station of an
  approved operating fire alarm company. The  supervisory  alarm  services
  shall  be  arranged  so as to provide positive indication at an approved
  central office or sprinkler alarm panel board that the pump has operated
  or that the source of electrical supply has failed.
    (c) Such pumps shall also comply with  the  applicable  provisions  of
  sections  27-946  and 27-947 of article three of this subchapter, except
  that only one supply  shall  be  required  and  no  enclosure  shall  be
  required.
