Section 27-967

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-967 Inspection and tests. All inspections and tests of sprinkler
  systems  shall  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of
  subdivisions  a  through  f  of  section 27-951 of article three of this
  subchapter and the requirements of this article.
    (a) Automatic wet and dry systems. Automatic  wet  and  dry  sprinkler
  systems  shall  be subjected to a hydrostatic pressure test for a period
  of one hour at a pressure of at least one hundred psig  at  the  topmost
  sprinkler  head  and  at  least  two  hundred  psig  at the lowest cross
  connection to the siamese connections.
    (b) Automatic dry pipe systems. In addition to the hydrostatic test in
  subdivision (a) of this section, the automatic dry  pipe  systems  shall
  also  be tested to forty psig air pressure for a twenty-four hour period
  with the pressure loss not to exceed one and one-half psig.
    (c) Nonautomatic sprinkler  systems.  Nonautomatic  sprinkler  systems
  shall  be  subjected to a hydrostatic pressure test of fifty psig at the
  topmost sprinkler head, with the test pressure maintained for  a  period
  of at least one hour.
    (d)  Pressure tanks. Pressure tanks shall be hydrostatically tested to
  a pressure of at least one and one-half times the working pressure for a
  period of one hour.
    (e)  Sprinkler  branches  and  heads  supplied  from  domestic  water.
  Sprinkler branches and heads shall be tested at the pressure required by
  this section or at the pressure of the domestic water supply as required
  by subchapter sixteen of this chapter, whichever is greater.
    (f)  System performance. A performance or operation test shall be made
  on  each  completed  system  to  determine  that  all  alarms,   valves,
  indicators,   pumps,   deluge   valves,   dry  pipe  valves,  and  other
  appurtenances are in good working order.
    (g) Supervisory service. All components connected to a central station
  of an approved operating fire alarm company shall be tested to determine
  that  they  are  in  good  working  order.  The  test  report  shall  be
  accompanied  by  a statement from the central supervisory agency stating
  that the agency has been retained to provide the  required  supervision;
  and when the services of the agency have been terminated it shall notify
  the commissioner in writing.
    (h)  Altered systems. When additions, alterations, or repairs are made
  to a sprinkler system, the entire system shall be tested  as  stated  in
  subdivisions  (a),  (b),  (c), (e), and (g) of this section, except that
  the pressure at the top of the system need not exceed one hundred  psig.
  In  addition,  a  flow  test of at least twenty gpm shall be made from a
  test connection at the end  of  the  sprinkler  header  or  the  section
  altered or repaired.
    (i)  Pump  tests.  Pumps  shall  be  tested  in  accordance  with  the
  applicable provisions of subdivisions (h) and (i) of section  27-951  of
  article three of this subchapter.
