    (1)  Siamese  connections shall be provided in accordance with section
  27-940  of  article  three  of  this  subchapter,  except  as   modified
  hereinafter.
    (2)  In below grade sprinkler systems for garage occupancies involving
  the storage or repair of motor vehicles, a siamese connection  shall  be
  provided  within  fifty  feet  of  every  exit or entrance used by motor
  vehicles.
    (3) Where partial sprinkler protection is required for storage spaces,
  one siamese connection shall be provided when more than thirty-six heads
  are  installed  in  one  fire  section.  Areas  subdivided,   when   the
  subdivisions  are totally enclosed by noncombustible construction having
  at least a two hour fire-resistance rating, shall be considered separate
  fire sections and the number of  heads  in  the  largest  section  shall
  determine the necessity for siamese connections.
    When  partial  sprinkler systems are installed to protect entire floor
  areas, siamese connections shall be provided in accordance with  section
  27-940 of article three of this subchapter.
    In  all  cases  where  partial  sprinkler  protection  is provided and
  siamese connections installed, metal signs shall  be  securely  fastened
  to,  or  above,  the  siamese  connection indicating the area protected.
  Where the building has two or more  frontages,  additional  metal  signs
  shall be installed indicating the location of the siamese connection.
    (4)  When  a  sprinkler  system supplies a group of buildings, siamese
  connections  shall  be  provided  for  each  building  as  required   by
  paragraphs one, two and three of this subdivision.
    (5) A single three-inch (seventy-six millimeter) inlet fire department
  connection  acceptable  to the fire commissioner may be provided for the
  sprinkler  system  in  lieu  of  each  required  siamese  connection  in
  buildings classified in occupancy group J-2 not exceeding six stories or
  seventy-five  feet in height and in spaces classified in occupancy group
  J-2 in buildings not exceeding  six  stories  or  seventy-five  feet  in
  height.
    (b)  Installation  and construction. The installation and construction
  of siamese connections shall be the same as required for fire  standpipe
  systems,  except  that  the  caps  of  each  automatic sprinkler siamese
  connection shall be painted green and the entire siamese connection of a
  nonautomatic sprinkler system shall be painted with aluminum paint,  and
  except  that  caps  of  each  siamese  connection  used  for combination
  standpipe and sprinkler  systems  shall  be  painted  yellow  and  signs
  provided  as  required  in  subdivision  (b) of section two of reference
  standard RS17-1.
    (c) A siamese connection need not be provided for a  sprinkler  system
  in one and two family dwellings.
