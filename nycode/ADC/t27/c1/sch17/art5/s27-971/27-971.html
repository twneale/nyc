Section 27-971

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-971  Classification  and  general  requirements  of  fire  alarm
  systems.  Fire alarms shall be classified as follows and shall meet  the
  following general requirements:
    (a)  Uncoded  closed circuit fire alarm system. Consisting of manually
  operated sending stations and audible  signaling  devices,  so  arranged
  that  the operation of any station will automatically sound continuously
  the signaling devices throughout all portions of the building.
    (b) Master coded closed circuit  fire  alarm  systems.  Consisting  of
  manually operated pull-lever type sending stations and audible signaling
  devices,   so   arranged   that   the  operation  of  any  station  will
  automatically sound the  signaling  devices  giving  a  common  code  of
  signals  throughout all portions of the building. The code shall consist
  of four rounds of a series of single strokes of the  signaling  devices,
  each round consisting of "3-3-3-3".
    (c)  Individually  coded  closed  circuit  general fire alarm systems.
  Consisting of manually operated pull-lever  type  sending  stations  and
  audible signaling devices, so arranged that the operation of any station
  will  automatically sound the signaling devices, throughout all portions
  of the building, for a minimum of four rounds of a distinctive  code  of
  signals  particular  to  the  station  at  which  the  signal  has  been
  initiated. The code numbers that  are  used  shall  be  subject  to  the
  approval of the fire commissioner.
    (d)  Individually  coded  closed circuit presignal fire alarm systems.
  Consisting of manually operated pull-lever  type  sending  stations  and
  signal  devices so arranged that the operation of any station will cause
  the sound of only the signal devices located  in  the  engine  room  and
  basement  and  other  places in the building where the members of a fire
  brigade work or assemble. The signaling device shall give four rounds of
  the particular code signal of the station at which the signal  has  been
  initiated.  Approved equipment shall be provided at each station so that
  the operation of any station performed with the aid of  a  key  or  plug
  will  sound  all of the signal devices located in the building with four
  rounds of the particular coded signal of the station initiated. The code
  numbers used shall be subject to the approval of the fire  commissioner.
  The  presignal  key  or plug shall be so designed that it can be readily
  identified. Presignal type  systems  will  not  generally  be  approved;
  however,  approval  may  be  obtained  from  the fire commissioner where
  special type occupancies may warrant such a system.
    (e) Combination unit or zone, and general alarm coded  closed  circuit
  fire  alarm  systems.  Consisting  of  manually operated pull-lever type
  sending stations and signal devices so arranged that  the  operation  of
  any station will cause all of the signaling devices in that unit or zone
  to  sound  four  rounds  of  the  particular coded signal of the station
  initiated, and simultaneously will cause all of the signaling devices on
  the general alarm circuit to sound  four  rounds  of  the  coded  signal
  designating  the  unit  or  zone  in  which  the  station is located. An
  approved register and time stamp may be used  in  connection  with  this
  system  when  approved by the fire commissioner. The register, if of the
  closed circuit type, shall be operated from a  separate  closed  circuit
  control board or panel isolated by a barrier from the main control panel
  in  the main fire alarm control cabinet. An approved closed circuit unit
  annunciator with trouble alarm circuit shall be  installed  as  part  of
  this system when required by the fire commissioner.
    (f)  Special  systems.  Consisting  of  the above systems as required,
  supplemented by special circuits for the operation of other  fire  alarm
  or  detection  devices  in  the systems, or electric control systems for
  stopping machinery, closing doors or ventilators, or shutting down  fans
  as  may  be  required  by  the  commissioner or the code, or to call the

  central station of a private operating company of the  fire  department.
  Automatic fire detecting systems may be connected to operate an interior
  fire   alarm   system  when  connected  thereto  by  an  approved  coded
  transmitter.  In  no case shall the transmitter be considered to replace
  the standard approved  interior  fire  alarm  station,  except  where  a
  transmitter  has  been  approved  for both purposes. The special control
  circuits and devices shall be separate and distinct from the fire  alarm
  system  but  shall be brought into action whenever the fire alarm system
  is set in operation.
    (g) Class E system.--Consisting of a class E fire alarm signal  system
  as  described  in  subdivision  (f) of section 27-972 of article five of
  this subchapter and reference standard RS17-3A. Such  systems  shall  be
  exempt  from  the  provisions  of section 27-973 of article five of this
  subchapter, except that compliance with paragraph two of subdivision (a)
  and subdivision (e) of such section shall be required.
    (h) Modified class E system.--Consisting of a modified  class  E  fire
  alarm signal system as described in subdivision (g) of section 27-972 of
  article  five  of  this  subchapter and reference standard RS17-3B. Such
  systems shall be exempt from the provisions of section 27-973 of article
  five of this subchapter, except that compliance with  paragraph  two  of
  subdivision (a) and subdivision (e) of such section shall be required.
    (i)  Class C system.--Consisting of a class C fire alarm signal system
  as described in subdivision (k) of section 27-972 and reference standard
  RS 17-3A. Such systems shall be exempt from the  provisions  of  section
  27-973  of  article five of this subchapter, except that compliance with
  paragraph two of subdivision (a) and subdivision  (e)  of  such  section
  shall be required.
    (j)  Class J system.--Consisting of a class J fire alarm signal system
  as described in subdivision (l) of section 27-972  of  article  five  of
  this  subchapter  and reference standard RS 17-3A. Such systems shall be
  exempt from the provisions of section 27-973 of  article  five  of  this
  subchapter, except that compliance with paragraph two of subdivision (a)
  and subdivision (e) of such section shall be required.
    (k)  Modified  class  J system.--Consisting of a modified class J fire
  alarm signal system as described in subdivision (m) of section 27-972 of
  article five of this subchapter and reference standard  RS  17-3B.  Such
  systems shall be exempt from the provisions of section 27-973 of article
  five  of  this  subchapter, except that compliance with paragraph two of
  subdivision (a) and subdivision (e) of such section shall be required.
    (l) Modified class J-1 system.--Consisting of  a  modified  class  J-1
  fire  alarm  signal  system as described in paragraph two of subdivision
  (j) of section 27-972 of article five of this subchapter.
