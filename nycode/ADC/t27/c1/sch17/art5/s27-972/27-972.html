  by  means  of  an  information  display  system  which shall be manually
  resettable from the fire command station only.
    (2) The nomenclature used for the location identification system shall
  be subject to the approval of the fire commissioner.
    (3)  In  addition to the visual devices required above, audible signal
  devices indicating operation of the fire alarm signal  system  shall  be

  throughout  the  building,  in  the  event  the other fifty (50) percent
  become inoperable. The electrical supply for  this  fire  alarm  system,
  including  the  amplifiers, shall be in accordance with applicable laws,
  rules and regulations.

  devices indicating operation of the fire alarm signal  system  shall  be
  provided  in the fire command station, mechanical control center and the
  regularly assigned location of  the  fire  safety  director.  Provisions

  shall  be  made  for  silencing the audible signal and transferring this
  signal to lamp indication.
    (4)  Operation of a manual station shall automatically transmit a fire

    (5)  The  fire  alarm  signal  may  be  sounded  over loud speakers as
  provided in reference standard RS 17-3B so located that their  operation
  will  be  heard clearly above any ambient noise, and shall be controlled
