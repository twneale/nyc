  every building more than  three  hundred  feet  high,  a  telephone  and

  the standpipe system.
    (b) Such system shall permit communication by permanent telephones  in
  the  pump  rooms,  on  the  entrance  floor,  and  in gravity tank rooms
  communicating with  floors,  and  by  means  of  permanent  or  portable
  telephones on each floor near the main standpipe riser. The system shall
  be  a selective ringing, common talking system supplied by a twenty-four
  volt direct current power source.
    (c) Permanent wall telephones shall be provided with six inch gongs at
  each instrument. The telephones in the pump room shall be equipped  with
  a  loudspeaking  receiver  so  that a voice can be distinctly heard at a
  distance of at least fifteen feet from the receiver.  All  other  floors
  shall  be  provided  with jacks, protected by break-glass boxes, or with
  permanent telephones.
    (d) At least three portable telephones with jack connections shall  be
  provided  for  each  standpipe installation, unless permanent telephones
  are installed at every required location. The portable telephones  shall
  be  kept in a cabinet located in the main hall of the entrance floor and
  shall be provided with a lock  capable  of  being  opened  with  a  fire
  department  standard key. Such cabinet shall be locked at all times. The
  panel of the  cabinet  door  shall  be  conspicuously  marked  "portable
  telephone for fire department use".
    (e)  A  pilot  light  shall  be  provided over the standpipe telephone
  cabinet in the entrance floor to indicate if the telephone is in use  or
  a receiver is off the hook.
    (f) Standpipe signaling devices.
    (1)  Manual  type individually coded sending stations shall be located
  in the main corridor of the  building  or  other  location  meeting  the
  approval  of  the  commissioner. This system shall be so arranged that a
  coded signal will be transmitted to the alarm sounding devices. An eight
  inch gong shall be provided in the pump rooms,  in  elevator  shafts  at
  intervals not exceeding ten floors, and at such other locations selected
  by   the   architect  or  engineer,  subject  to  the  approval  of  the
  commissioner. All apparatus used in connection with the signaling system
  shall be of an approved type and installed as required by the provisions
  of reference standard RS 17-3 governing  the  installation  of  interior
  fire alarm systems.
    (2)  Adjacent  to  each  telephone station and near the main standpipe
  riser, there shall be provided an  approved  closed  circuit  strap  key
  enclosed  in  a  sheet  metal  box  equipped  with  a  paracentric  fire
  department lock and approved hinges. The strap key shall be connected in
  series wth the box circuit of the signal sending station.
    (3) A card of instructions shall be placed in  the  pump  room  giving
  code  numbers  of signaling stations, the pressure obtainable at various
  speeds of the fire  pump  motor,  and  such  other  information  as  the
  commissioner may direct.
    (g) Where the building is subject to the provisions of subdivision (f)
  or (g) of section 27-972 of this article with respect to the requirement
  for  a modified class E fire alarm signal system, the standpipe fireline
  telephone and signaling system may be  combined  with  such  fire  alarm
  system provided:
    (1)  the  alarms and two-way voice communication with the fire command
  station include the pump room and gravity tank or  pressure  tank  room,
  and

    (2)  a  designated  floor  station  of the modified class E fire alarm
  signal system is located at or near the main standpipe  riser  on  every
  floor.
