Section 27-848.09

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-848.09  Factory-built  fireplaces,  fireplace  stoves  and  room
  heaters.  (a) Acceptance. Factory-built fireplaces, fireplace stoves and
  room heaters shall be listed  and  accepted  for  use  as  wood  burning
  appliances.
    (b)  Occupancy  group limitations. Factory-built fireplaces, fireplace
  stoves and room heaters shall not be permitted in buildings  other  than
  those in residential occupancy group classifications J-2 and J-3, except
  that  installations  within  other occupancy groups may be authorized by
  the commissioner pursuant to rules and regulations  promulgated  by  the
  department.
    (c) Chimney requirements.
    (1)  The chimney systems of factory-built fireplaces, fireplace stoves
  and room  heaters  shall  be  constructed  in  accordance  with  section
  27-869.01.
    (2)  No  chimney  shall  serve  more than one factory-built fireplace,
  fireplace stove or  room  heater  or  be  pierced  to  serve  any  other
  appliance.
    (d) Additional limitations. Factory-built fireplaces, fireplace stoves
  or room heaters shall be:
    (1) located only in exterior rooms, and
    (2)  limited  to  space  heating  of  the  room  within which they are
  located.
    (e) Chimney connectors.
    (l) Stovepipe.
    a. The stovepipe (or chimney  connector)  connecting  a  factory-built
  fireplace,  fireplace  stove  or room heater to a chimney may contain no
  more than two elbows. The total length of the connecting pipe should  be
  kept as short as possible while maintaining the required minimum spacing
  between  the factory-built fireplace, fireplace stove or room heater and
  combustible materials. See subdivision (h) of section 27-848.08 of  this
  code.
    b. The connector pipe shall be as large as the flue collars (where the
  connector  pipe  joins  the  factory-built fireplace, fireplace stove or
  room heater), and shall be fabricated from  steel  coated  with  a  high
  temperature rust inhibitor.
    c.  The pipe's horizontal section shall rise one-quarter inch for each
  foot of pipe, with the highest point being at  the  chimney  inlet,  and
  shall not be longer than three quarters of the chimney height.
    d.  When  joining  sections of pipe, the joints shall overlap at least
  two inches, with  the  crimped  (male)  end  pointing  down  to  prevent
  creosote  drip  or  leak.  Each  joint shall be secured with three sheet
  metal screws.  All fits shall be snug.
    e. The thimble shall be cemented with high temperature cement  at  the
  flue inlet. The pipe shall not project into the flue itself.
    f. Connector pipe clearance to combustible materials shall be at least
  three  times the pipe diameter (e.g. eighteen inches for six inch pipe),
  but not less than eighteen inches.
    g. Stovepipes shall not pass  through  floors,  ceilings  or  closets.
  Stovepipes  shall  not  pass  through  exterior  walls  unless  directly
  connected with a thimble to the chimney as noted in  subparagraph  h  of
  this paragraph.
    h. Alternately, a listed and accepted noncombustible thimble larger in
  diameter  than the connector pipe, or a burned fireclay or metal thimble
  surrounded by not less than twelve inches of brickwork may be  used  for
  protection.
    i.  Connectors  and  chimneys  for factory-built fireplaces, fireplace
  stoves and room heaters shall be  designed,  located  and  installed  to

  permit  ready access for internal inspection and cleaning, in compliance
  with the requirements of subchapter fifteen of this chapter.
    (2)  Connection  to  masonry fireplace flue. A factory-built fireplace
  stove or room heater or insert may use a masonry fireplace flue when the
  following conditions are met:
    a. There is a connector which extends from the fireplace stove or room
  heater to the flue liner.
    b. The cross-sectional area of the flue is no more  than  three  times
  the  cross-sectional  area  of  the  flue  collar  of  the factory-built
  fireplace, fireplace stove or room heater.
    c. There is a  noncombustible  seal  below  the  entry  point  of  the
  connector if the appliance vents directly through the chimney wall above
  the smoke chamber.
    d. The chimney system can be inspected and cleaned.
    e.  Air  from  the  habitable  space  is not used to dilute combustion
  products in the chimney flue.
    f.  Hearth  extensions   are   provided   in   accordance   with   the
  manufacturer's   instructions   or  are  of  masonry  of  noncombustible
  construction in accordance with subdivision (d) of section 27-848.07.
