    &sect;  27-792  General  requirements. All heating, combustion, and cooking
  equipment shall be installed with adequate clearances  from  combustible
  contruction in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter. Either
  the  equipment  shall  be  provided  with  insulation  or  the  building
  construction shall be  fire  protected,  so  that  during  continued  or
  intermittent operation the surface of combustible construction materials
  will  not  be  raised  to  a temperature higher than one hundred seventy
  degrees Fahrenheit. Such  equipment  shall  be  located,  arranged,  and
  protected so that the means of access to them for ordinary operation and
  maintenance  will  not be hazardous. They shall not be located in exits,
  hoistways, nor in the same space with other equipment or materials  when
  the  proximity  to  the  other  equipment  or  materials  would create a
  hazardous condition. All piping shall be installed so as to provide  for
  adequate expansion and contraction.
