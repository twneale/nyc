    &sect; 27-830 Piping. (a) Installation of piping and tubing.
    (1)  Exposed  piping  shall be protected against mechanical damage and
  shall be adequately supported with rigid metal fasteners or hangers. All
  pipes connected to buried tanks,  except  test  well  piping,  shall  be
  provided with double swing joints at the tank.
    (2)  Only new wrought iron, steel, or brass pipe, or type K or heavier
  copper tubing, or aluminum alloy tubing,  properly  identified,  may  be
  used.  Metal  tubing  when  used  for  conveying oil shall be adequately
  protected.  Such  tubing  may  be  installed  at  the   burner   without
  protection. Drawn tubing when used in domestic installations shall be of
  at least 3/8 in. inside diameter up to the shut-off valve at the burner.
  Soldered connections shall be prohibited.
    (3) Overflow pipes, where installed, shall not be smaller in size than
  the supply pipe.
    (b) Relief valves.
    (1)  Where a shut-off valve is installed in the discharge line from an
  oil pump, a relief valve  shall  be  installed  in  the  discharge  line
  between the pump and the first shut-off valve.
    (2) A relief or pressure regulating valve shall be provided in the oil
  piping system on the heater side of the shut-off valves.
    (3)  Relief  valves shall be set to discharge at not more than one and
  one-half times the maximum working pressure of the system. The discharge
  from relief valves shall be returned to  the  storage  tank  or  to  the
  supply line. There shall be no shut-off valve in the line of relief.
    (c)  Fuel  oil heaters. Fuel oil heaters shall not be installed within
  the steam or  water  space  of  a  boiler.  Fuel  oil  heaters  and  the
  connecting  piping  shall  be arranged to prevent oil leakage from being
  transmitted to the boiler. This  may  be  accomplished  by  any  of  the
  following methods:
    (1) By discarding the condensate from the heaters.
    (2) By using approved double tube or other approved heaters.
    (3)  By  means  of a secondary hot water or steam heating system where
  the water or steam from the boiler has no direct contact  with  the  oil
  heater.
    (4)  By  a  sight  tank  arrangement for collecting and inspecting the
  condensate which is provided with a pump controlled by a hand switch for
  returning the condensate to the normal return system.
    (5) By such other method as may be permitted by the commissioner.
    (d) Vent pipe.
    (1) A vent pipe of iron or steel, without trap, draining to the  tank,
  shall  be provided for each storage tank. The lower end of the vent pipe
  shall not extend more than one inch through the top of the storage tank.
  Cross-connection between a vent pipe and fill pipe is prohibited.
    (2) Where a battery of storage tanks designed to hold the  same  grade
  of oil is installed, vent pipes may be run into a main header.
    (3) Vents shall be at least one and one-quarter inches in diameter for
  storage tanks not exceeding eleven hundred gallons capacity and at least
  two  inches  in  diameter for storage tanks of eleven hundred gallons or
  more except that vents for storage tanks of  sixty  gallon  capacity  or
  less shall be at least one-half inch in diameter. Vents for tanks inside
  of  buildings  above  the  lowest  floor  shall  be run into the primary
  storage tank vent.
    (4) Vent pipes shall be provided with an  approved  weatherproof  hood
  having  a  free  area  of  at least the pipe size area. Vent pipes shall
  terminate outside the building in a nonhazardous location, at least  two
  feet  from any building opening and not less than two feet nor more than
  twelve feet above the fill pipe terminal, unless otherwise permitted  by
  the commissioner. If the vent pipe terminal is not visible from the fill

  pipe  terminal location, a one inch tell-tale line shall be connected to
  the tank and shall parallel the fill pipe and terminate at the fill pipe
  terminal with an unthreaded end. Such tell-tale lines shall be  provided
  with  a  check valve set to prevent flow of surface water to the storage
  tank.
    (e) Fill pipes.
    (1) Fill pipes shall terminate outside the buildings,  with  the  fill
  pipe  terminal  located  at  or  above grade, at least two feet from any
  building opening and five feet from any subway grating at or  below  the
  level  of  the  fill  pipe terminal. No fill pipe shall be less than two
  inches in diameter, and no fill pipe for no. 6 oil shall  be  less  than
  three  inch in diameter. Where no. 6 oil is used, the fill pipe terminal
  shall be located  within  three  feet  of  the  curb,  unless  otherwise
  required  by  the department of transportation or the transit authority.
  Where there are facilities for the delivery tank truck to drive onto the
  premises, the fill terminal may be located elsewhere than at  the  curb,
  provided  that the location complies with the other requirements of this
  subchapter.
    (2) Each storage tank shall be provided with  a  separate  fill  pipe,
  except  that  where  a battery of tanks is installed containing the same
  grade of oil, a common fill and header pipe may be installed.
    (3) Where the top of the storage tank is above the fill pipe terminal,
  the fill pipe shall be connected to the top of  the  tank  and  provided
  with  a  shut-off  valve  and  swing  check valve both of which shall be
  located at the fill pipe  terminal.  However,  the  shut-off  and  check
  valves may be installed in an accessible location inside the building at
  or below the level of the fill pipe terminal.
    (4) All fill pipe terminals shall be of an approved type, and shall be
  provided  with  lugs  for  embedding in concrete. In lieu of lugs, a set
  screw or threads to fasten the terminal to the fill pipe  may  be  used.
  The  outer  flange  of  the  fill pipe terminal or the seal cap shall be
  permanently marked "fuel oil". The fill pipe terminal shall be  threaded
  or  provided  with  other  equivalent means to receive the seal cap. The
  seal cap shall be suitably slotted for receiving an opening wrench,  and
  an  oilproof gasket inserted in a groove in the fill pipe terminal shall
  be provided so as to make the seal cap leakproof. A strainer  shall  not
  be  required  but,  if  used, shall be of at least one-eighth inch mesh.
  Where a storage system for volatile flammable oil and a  storage  system
  for  fuel  oil  are to be used in the same premises, the terminal of the
  fuel oil pipe shall be provided with a left-handed thread and  the  fill
  pipe  fitting  shall  be  of a different size than that required for the
  fill pipes to the tanks containing the volatile flammable oil.
    (f) Piping from transfer pump to equipment or to storage  tanks  above
  the lowest floor.
    (1)  The  piping from a transfer pump to equipment at levels above the
  lowest floor or to storage tanks at levels above  the  lowest  floor  in
  buildings,  the  return  piping,  and  vent piping shall comply with the
  applicable provisions of subdivisions (a) and (d) of  this  section  and
  shall  be  enclosed  in  a  shaft  constructed  of four inch concrete or
  masonry having a four inch clearance from all  pipe  or  pipe  covering,
  except  that  no  such  enclosures  shall  be  required  within the room
  containing the pump, tank,  or  equipment  where  such  room  is  itself
  enclosed with construction and materials having at least a two hour fire
  resistance  rating.  Provision  shall  be  made  for expansion in piping
  without the use of expansion joints.
    (2) Where it is necessary to make horizontal  offsets  in  the  supply
  piping  and  pipe  shafts  such  piping shall be enclosed in a sleeve of
  other piping of at least no. 10 U.S.  standard  gage  steel,  two  sizes

  larger  and  arranged to drain into the shaft. Horizontal piping offsets
  shall be further  enclosed  in  construction  having  a  two  hour  fire
  resistance rating, except that no such enclosure or pipe sleeve shall be
  required  within  the room containing the pump, tank, or equipment where
  such room is itself enclosed with construction and materials  having  at
  lease a two hour fire resistance rating.
    (3)  A  drain  pipe shall be installed at the base of shafts enclosing
  the supply and overflow piping. The pipe shall lead  to  an  open  sight
  drain or to an open sump.
    (4)  Oil lines for equipment or tanks shall be steel pipe ASTM A-53 or
  A-106, grade B seamless, schedule 40 with welded connections up  to  the
  oil  tank  or  equipment, except that fittings at the tank or equipment,
  shut off valves and other fuel oil  flow  and  control  devices  may  be
  screwed or flanged.
    (5)  Pipe shafts shall not be penetrated by or contain other piping or
  ducts.
    (6) The piping shall be located and secured from  movement  so  as  to
  prevent  undue  stress  on  the  piping  and  to isolate the piping from
  vibrations from any equipment.
    (7) Pipe connections to the main header (supply or  return)  shall  be
  made  from  the  top  of  the  header,  except  for systems described in
  paragraph (11) of this subdivision.
    (8) Required air vents and vacuum breakers shall be designed for their
  required use.
    (9) All air vents and vacuum breakers shall be hard piped to a curb or
  pan as provided for in subdivision (b) of section 27-829.
    (10) In systems with equipment  above  the  lowest  floor  where  such
  equipment  is designed to operate utilizing fuel stored above the lowest
  floor, piping diameters shall not exceed four inches. However, where  an
  applicant  demonstrates  by  the  inclusion of calculations on the plans
  that a greater diameter is necessary to ensure the proper flow  for  the
  functioning  of  the system, such greater diameter may be permitted. All
  oil stored above the lowest floor  shall  be  in  tanks  complying  with
  subdivision (b) of section 27-829 of this code; piping shall not be used
  for fuel storage purposes.
    (11)  In  systems  with  equipment  above  the lowest floor where such
  equipment is designed to operate utilizing fuel pumped  as  needed  from
  the  lowest floor and without utilizing fuel oil stored above the lowest
  floor, piping diameters throughout such systems  shall  not  exceed  the
  design  flow  (three  times the maximum firing rate as calculated by the
  engineer  or  architect).  However,  piping   diameters   within   rooms
  containing  such  equipment  may  exceed the calculated design flow pipe
  size to provide limited reservoir storage to prime  equipment,  provided
  such  reservoir  storage  is  counted  toward  the  maximum  two hundred
  seventy-five gallons of  oil  storage  per  story  as  provided  for  in
  subdivision b of section 27-829 of this code.
    (g)  Heating  coils  in  storage  tanks. The heating of oil in storage
  tanks shall be by means of coils using low pressure hot water or  steam,
  or by means of electric heaters approved for use in oil storage tanks.
    (h) Valves and devices to control the flow of oil.
    (1)  Where  more than one storage tank is connected to a common supply
  line, a shut-off valve shall be provided in  the  supply  line  at  each
  tank.  Where  more  than  one  burner  is  connected  to a supply line a
  shut-off valve shall be provided at each burner. Where a single tank and
  a single burner are installed, a shut-off valve shall be required in the
  supply line at the tank and another at the burner. Valves shall be brass
  or equivalent in corrosion and  fire  resistance,  shall  provide  tight

  shut-off,  and  shall be rated at one hundred twenty-five psi or greater
  as required by the pressure in the system.
    (2)  Where  a  storage  tank is located so that the top of the tank is
  above the oil inlet to the burner or to the fuel pump, and  the  storage
  tank  capacity  is  greater  than  two hundred seventy-five gallons, the
  supply line to the burner shall be provided with an approved anti-syphon
  device. The device shall be located at the highest point in  the  supply
  line.  Where  an approved foot valve is used in the tank and the tank is
  constructed with a manhole, an anti-syphon device shall not be required.
  No anti-syphon device shall be required where no. 6 fuel oil is used.
    (3) The pressure in oil lines to  burners  located  above  the  lowest
  floor  of a building shall not be more than is required to circulate oil
  to and from the burners, and all  parts  of  the  oil  system  shall  be
  capable of withstanding the maximum working pressure in that part of the
  system.
    (4)  A remote control shall be provided to stop the flow of oil to any
  burner. Such control shall be located outside the entrance to  the  room
  in  which  the  burner  is  located  and  as  close  to such entrance as
  practicable, except that when an outside location is impracticable, such
  control may be located immediately inside the room in which  the  burner
  is  located, provided such location is accessible at all times. All such
  controls shall be permanently labeled "remote control for  oil  burner."
  On  storage  tanks  of  sixty gallon or less capacity used with manually
  operated burners, such remote control may be  installed  in  the  supply
  lines between tank and burner.
    (5)  Pressure  in  a  storage  tank for the purpose of discharging oil
  shall be prohibited.
    (6) In systems where either steam or air is  used  for  atomizing  the
  oil, the oil and the atomizing supply shall be interlocked so that where
  the  supply  of  either  is interrupted, the supply of the other will be
  immediately cut off.
    (i) Oil level indicating devices and test wells.
    (1) All tanks located inside buildings shall be provided with  an  oil
  level indicating device. Test wells shall be prohibited in tanks located
  inside of buildings. Unused tank openings shall be permanently sealed to
  prevent the removal of plugs or cover.
    (2)  Oil level indicating devices shall be designed and constructed of
  substantial materials so that there can be no  leakage  of  oil  or  oil
  vapor.
    (3)  Test wells in storage tanks located outside of buildings shall be
  capped oil tight and kept closed when not in use.
