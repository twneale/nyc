  authorized  insurance  companies  or  other  qualified inspectors in the
  manner  set  forth  in  rules  and  regulations   promulgated   by   the
  commissioner. Such inspections shall also include the chimney connectors
  described  in  article  three of subchapter fifteen of this chapter. All

  subdivision  shall  be  qualified  under section two hundred four of the
  labor law and rules and regulations promulgated by the  commissioner  of
  labor.
    (2)  Each  owner  of  a  high-pressure  boiler, as defined in sections

  inspection conducted by the department or by a duly authorized insurance
  company.
    (c) Owners annual statement.
    (1)  The  owner  of each boiler that is subject to periodic inspection
  shall  file  an  annual  written  statement   with   the   commissioner,
  specifying:
    a. The location of each boiler.
    b.  Whether  or  not  the  owner,  agent, or lessee has had the boiler

  inspector in accordance with the requirements of subdivision (b) of this
  section,  setting forth the name and address of the insurance company or
  other qualified inspector, the date of inspection, and the policy number
  covering the boiler.
    (2) If the periodic boiler inspection has been  performed  by  a  duly
  authorized  insurance  company  or other qualified inspector pursuant to
  subdivision  (b)  of  this  section,  the  annual  statement  shall   be
  accompanied by a signed copy of the report of each boiler inspection, on
  such forms and in such manner as required by the commissioner.
    (3) The statement shall be filed within thirty days after installation
  of  a boiler. Thereafter, it shall be filed on or before the last day of
  December of the year of each annual inspection.

  removed  or  discontinued  from  use shall file a written notice of such
  removal or discontinuance with the commissioner within  thirty  days  of
  the date of removal or discontinuance.
    (e)  Failure  to  file statements and notices. If an owner of a boiler
  shall fail to file any statement or notice required under this  section,
  such  owner  shall  be  liable  for  a civil penalty pursuant to section
  26-125 of this code.
    (f) Additional inspections. In addition to the inspections required by
  subdivisions (a) and (b) of this section, the commissioner may make such

  additional inspections as required to enforce  the  provisions  of  this
  code. No fee shall be charged for such additional inspections.
    (g)  Fees.  Every  owner  of  a  boiler in use and inspected by a duly
  authorized insurance company shall pay to the department an  annual  fee
  for  each  boiler  in  the  amount prescribed by section 26-213 of title
  twenty-six of the administrative code to cover the city's administrative
  and supervisory costs involved. The fee shall be payable at the time  of
