Section 27-794

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 27-794 Fuel burning and fuel storage installations. (a) Field tests.
    (1)  All  liquid  fuel  piping  and  fuel  oil  storage tanks shall be
  hydrostatically tested for tightness by  the  contractor  who  made  the
  installation  before  the  work  is  closed  in and before the system is
  operated. The piping shall be tested  at  one  and  one-half  times  the
  maximum  working  pressure  applicable to that part of the piping system
  but at a pressure less than the test pressure required for  the  storage
  tank.  The  minimum pressure for testing tanks shall be one and one-half
  times the maximum working pressure applicable to the tank but in no case
  less than twenty-five psi. The hydrostatic pressure shall be  maintained
  until all joints and connections have been visually inspected for leaks,
  but  in no case for less than one-half hour. The tank shall not show any
  permanent deformation as a result of the test. A record shall be kept of
  the pressure tests showing the name of the contractor and the  pressures
  at which the piping and the tank were tested.
    (2)  Gas  distribution  piping  shall  be  tested for tightness by the
  contractor who made the installation before the work is  closed  in  and
  before  the  system  is operated, in accordance with the requirements of
  section 27-922 of article seven of subchapter sixteen of  this  chapter.
  For gas storage tanks see chapter four of this title.
    (b)   Inspections.  Fuel  burning  equipment  shall  be  inspected  in
  accordance  with  the  requirements  for   controlled   inspections   in
  subchapter  one, except that the inspections may be made by an architect
  or engineer who need not  be  in  the  employ  of  the  owner  or  by  a
  representative of the commissioner.
    (c)  Temporary  use  permit.  A  temporary  equipment  use  permit, as
  provided in subchapter one, may  be  issued  by  the  commissioner  upon
  receipt   of   a  statement  signed  by  the  contractor  who  made  the
  installation, certifying that:
    (1) The portions of the work completed conform with all provisions  of
  the code listing at the same time any items still to be completed.
    (2)  All  required  pressure tests have been successfully completed on
  the portion of the work installed and giving the pressures at which  the
  tests were made.
    (d)  Instruction cards. For oil burning systems, cards giving complete
  instructions for the care and operation of the system shall be furnished
  and shall be permanently located in an  easily  visible  and  accessible
  location near the equipment.
    (e)  Exceptions. An equipment use permit shall not be required for any
  installation for which a work permit is  not  required  as  provided  in
  section 27-189 of article eighteen of subchapter one of this chapter.
