Section 27-843

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;   27-843   Construction   of  incinerators.  Incinerators  shall  be
  constructed so as to be gas tight and shall be lined or  protected  with
  heat resistive materials suitable for the services required, as follows:
    (a)  Masonry  incinerators. When the combined hearth and grate area is
  twenty square feet or less, or the number of habitable rooms  served  is
  one  hundred  or  less,  combustion  chambers,  separation chambers, and
  connecting gas passages shall be constructed of eight inch common  brick
  thick  and lined with four and one-half inch of refractory material with
  an intervening air space of one inch. When the combined hearth and grate
  area is more than twenty square feet, or the number of  habitable  rooms
  served  is  more  than  one  hundred,  combustion  chambers,  separation
  chambers, and connecting gas passages shall  be  constructed  of  common
  brick  eight  inches  thick  and  lined  with  nine inches of refractory
  material with an intervening air space of one inch.
    (1) TIES. Noncorroding metal ties shall be used at least  every  fifth
  course  of  common-brick.  Structural steel angles, straps, and tiebacks
  shall be installed on all masonry  incinerators  having  more  than  one
  hundred twenty-five cubic feet of combustion chamber volume.
    (2)  INTERIOR  CONSTRUCTION.  Interior  walls,  curtain  walls, bridge
  walls, or baffles shall, in every case, be of refractory brick, at least
  nine inches thick.
    (3) ARCHES. Sprung arches may be used if the span is  less  than  four
  feet  Flat  suspended type arches shall have a minimum of five inches of
  refractory material between the  furnace  heat  and  the  hangers.  Flat
  suspended  arches  shall  have  an insulated block roof at least two and
  one-half inches thick.
    (4) ISOLATION. No structural supports for the vertical building  flues
  or  other  parts  of  the  building shall rest upon the incinerator; nor
  shall any metal guides,  hangers,  or  structural  steel  parts  of  the
  incinerator be exposed to direct heat of combustion.
    (5)  THERMAL BLOCK INSULATION. High temperature block insulation shall
  be at least equal to type 3 specified in reference standard RS14-10.
    (6) REFRACTORY. Refractory material shall be  firebrick  or  hydraulic
  setting castable refractory.
    a.  Firebrick.  Firebrick  shall  be  high  duty,  spall resistant and
  conform to type A reference standard RS 14.7.
    b. Castable  refractories.  Castable  refractories  shall  conform  to
  reference standard RS 14.8 (Class F).
    c.  Mortar. Mortar for firebrick shall be air setting high temperature
  cement conforming to reference standard RS 14-14.
    (b) Steel-cased incinerators. In lieu of the eight inch  common  brick
  outer  wall  and  one inch air space required in subdivision (a) of this
  section, the  outside  enclosure  of  incinerators  may  be  of  no.  12
  manufacturers  standard  gauge  steel casing that is welded, riveted, or
  bolted to be gastight, with at least two thicknesses of two and one-half
  inch high-temperature block insulation applied with staggered joints.
    (c) Other constructions.  Other  forms  of  incinerator  construction,
  equivalent  in  terms  of  structural  strength,  insulating  value, and
  temperature and erosion resistance, may be used, subject to approval  by
  the commissioner.
