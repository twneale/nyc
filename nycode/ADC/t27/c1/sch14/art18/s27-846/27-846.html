<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-846 Accessibility. Sufficient space shall be provided around the
  incinerator and its appurtenances to facilitate  cleaning,  repair,  and
  servicing. Clearance shall be provided to allow the cleanout doors to be
  completely  opened so that all parts of the combustion chamber, ash pit,
  separation chambers, etc. may be reached and so implements used for this
  purpose can be freely manipulated. All dampers, gates, burners,  valves,
  levers,   etc.,  shall  be  accessible  for  repair  and  adjustment  or
  replacement. No construction shall be located closer than sixteen inches
  to any part of an incinerator,  except  that  noncombustible  structural
  members  two  feet  wide  or  less  parallel  to the incinerator, may be
  located as close as six inches to the incinerator, provided such members
  do not reduce accessibility to any moving parts of the incinerator.
