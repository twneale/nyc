Section 27-809

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 27-809 Insulation and clearances. All accessible piping in habitable
  and   occupiable  rooms  carrying  steam,  water,  or  other  fluids  at
  temperatures exceeding one hundred sixty-five degrees  Fahrenheit  shall
  be  insulated  to  prevent  the  temperature at the outer surface of the
  insulation from exceeding sixty degrees  Fahrenheit  above  the  ambient
  temperature.  The  openings  for  insulated  piping  through combustible
  floors, walls, partitions, ceilings and other  combustible  construction
  shall   include   clearance  and  insulation  adequate  to  satisfy  the
  requirements of section 27-792 of article one of this subchapter.  Where
  accessible  piping  carries  a  fluid  not  exceeding  two hundred fifty
  degrees Fahrenheit and insulation would interfere with  the  functioning
  of  the  system,  such  piping  may  be  uninsulated provided sufficient
  clearance is maintained from the combustible construction  so  that  the
  temperature  limitation  of  section  27-792  of  article  one  of  this
  subchapter is not exceeded, and all uninsulated piping shall be provided
  with at least one-half inch clearance from combustible materials.
