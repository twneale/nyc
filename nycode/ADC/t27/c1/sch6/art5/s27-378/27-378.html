Section 27-378

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-378  Escalators.  Escalators  may  be  used  as exits in lieu of
  interior stairs provided they comply with all  of  the  requirements  of
  subchapter eighteen of this chapter and with the applicable requirements
  for enclosed interior stairs, except as modified below:
    (a)  Capacity. The capacity of escalators as listed in table 6-1 shall
  be based on the following:
 
                           MINIMUM WIDTH (IN.) AT:
  ========================================================================
                                                         Units of
           Step        Balustrade{1}    Enclosure{2}    Exit Width
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
            24             32               52             1-1/2
            40             48               68             2
  ========================================================================
 
  Notes:
    {1} Measured twenty-seven inches above front edge of tread.
    {2} Clear width above handrails.
 
    (b) Acceptable exits. Only escalators moving in the direction of  exit
  travel  may  be  credited  as  exits,  except  that any escalator may be
  credited when it is connected to an automatic fire detection system that
  will cause it to stop simultaneously with the  detection  of  fire.  The
  detection  system  shall  comply  with  the  construction  provisions of
  subchapter seventeen of this chapter. Where an escalator  provides  exit
  facilities  from  only  one floor of a building, the automatic detection
  system shall be located on that floor.  Where  escalators  provide  exit
  facilities  from  more  than  one  floor,  the detection system shall be
  located on all floors so served,  and  shall  cause  escalators  on  all
  floors of the section of the building that they serve to stop operating.
  The  stopping  mechanism  shall  operate  to  bring  the  escalator to a
  gradual, rather than an abrupt stop.
    (c) Escalators not used as exits. Escalators  that  do  not  serve  as
  exits,  and  that  connect more than two stories of a building, shall be
  completely  enclosed   with   noncombustible   construction   having   a
  three-quarter  hour  fire-resistance  rating,  except  that in buildings
  completely protected by an automatic sprinkler system complying with the
  construction requirements of subchapter seventeen of this chapter,  such
  escalators  may,  alternatively,  be  protected  by  one  of the methods
  specified in subchapter eighteen of this chapter.
