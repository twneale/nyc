  passageway  serving  two  or  more  vertical  exits  shall  be  equal to
  seventy-five percent of the width of all of the vertical exits  that  it
  serves.  Width  shall  be  measured  in  the clear between the narrowest
  points at any projections such as radiators, door swings, or pilasters.
    (c) Height. Exit passageways shall have a clear height of  seven  feet
  six inches for at least seventy-five per cent of the floor area, with no
  point  less  than  seven feet in height. No projection below the ceiling
  shall be located so as to obstruct full view of exit signs.
    (d) Changes in level. Changes in level requiring less than two  risers
  in  an  exit passageway shall be by a ramp complying with section 27-377

  discharge points of all vertical exits to open exterior spaces that  are
  remote from each other.
    (2)  WIDTH.  Street floor lobbies serving as exit passageways shall be
  increased in width to accommodate the occupant load of all communicating
  spaces on the lobby floor that exit through them. The capacity per  unit
  of width shall be as listed in table 6-1.
    (3)  OPENINGS.  Openings  between street floor lobbies serving as exit
