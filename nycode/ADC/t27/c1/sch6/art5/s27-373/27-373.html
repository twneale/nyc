  opening on them, but in no case less than three feet eight inches.
    (2) They shall be  enclosed  at  each  end  by  doors  complying  with
  subdivision (b) of this section.
    (3) The floor level at doors shall be the same as that of the building
  except  that  the floor level of open balconies or open bridges shall be
  approximately seven and one-half inches lower.
    (4) Where there is a difference in level between the areas  connected,
  the floors of the horizontal exit shall be ramped not more than one inch
  in ten inches.
    (5) Exterior wall openings within thirty feet horizontally of any open
  bridge  or balcony or below any open bridge or balcony shall be provided
  with opening protectives having a  three-quarter  hour  fire  protection
  rating.

  twelve feet wide, and shall be  constructed  as  required  for  exterior
