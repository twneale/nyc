  that in buildings classified  in  occupancy  groups  J-2  and  J-3,  the
  minimum  clear  headroom  may  be  six  feet eight inches. Headroom in a
  flight of stairs shall  be  measured  vertically  between  two  parallel
  inclined  planes,  one of which contains the line of the nosing or upper
  front edge of each tread and extends to its intersection with a  landing
  and  the  other  of  which is through any point directly above the first
  plane that limits the headroom of the stair.
    (d) Landings and platforms. Landings and platforms shall  be  provided
  at  the  head  and  foot of each flight of stairs, except at the head of
  basement stairs in one- and two-family dwellings, and shall comply  with
  the following:
    (1)  The  minimum width of landings and platforms perpendicular to the
  direction of travel shall be equal to at least the width of  the  stairs
  except  that  on  a  straight-run  stair, the distance between risers of
  upper and lower flights at intermediate landings or platforms  need  not
  be more than forty-four inches.
    (2)  The  maximum  vertical  rise of a single flight of stairs between
  floors, between landings or platforms, or between a floor and a  landing
  or  platform  shall  not  exceed  eight  feet in buildings classified in
  occupancy groups F and H, and twelve feet in all other occupancy groups.
  No flight of stairs shall have less than two risers.
    (3) Landings and platforms  shall  be  enclosed  on  sides  by  walls,
  grilles or guards at least three feet high.
    (e)  Risers  and treads. Risers and treads shall comply with table 6-4

  stairs from story to story.
    (3) Winders shall not be permitted in required exit stairs  except  in
  one-  and  two-family dwellings and except as permitted in subdivision l
  of this section. The width  of  winder  treads  when  measured  eighteen
  inches  from  the  narrower  end shall be at least equal to the width of
  treads above or below the winding section.

    (4) Curving or skewed stairs may be used as exits when the  tread  and
  riser  relationship  is  in accordance with table 6-4 when measured at a
  point eighteen inches in from the narrow end of the tread; and no  tread
  shall  be  more  than three inches narrower or three inches wider at any
  point than the width established eighteen inches in from the narrow end.
    (f)  Guards and handrails. Stairs shall have walls, grilles, or guards

  landings, nor shall any door at  any  point  of  its  swing  reduce  the
  effective  width  of  the  landing  or  stair  to less than seventy-five
  percent of the required width of the landing or stair, or to  less  than
  the  width  of the door opening on them. The width of doors from a stair
  shall not be less than the number of units of exit  width  required  for
  the  capacity  of the stair, but in no case shall the door width be less
  than required by subdivision (e) of section 27-371 of this article.
    (h)  Stair  construction.   Risers,   treads,   stringers,   landings,
  platforms,  and  guards,  exclusive  of  handrails,  shall  be  built of
  noncombustible materials except that interior  stairs  in  buildings  of
  construction group II may be built of combustible materials in buildings
  classified  in occupancy group B-2, C, D or E when the buildings are two
  stories in height or less, and  in  buildings  classified  in  occupancy
  group  J-2  or J-3 when the buildings are not more than three stories in
  height, and in the case of J-2 occupancy group,  when  occupied  by  not
  more  than  three families. Interior stairs shall have solid treads. All
  risers shall be closed except as otherwise provided in  subdivision  (i)
  of  this  section.    When  of  combustible  construction, the soffit of
  interior stairs shall be fire protected by  material  having  a  minimum

  exclusively by not more than one family on each story without  boarders,
  roomers  or  lodgers  and  not  more  than  three stories in height, the
  enclosing construction may have a one hour fire-resistance rating  which
  may  be  constructed  of  combustible  material  provided that the stair
  enclosure is protected with an automatic sprinkler system complying with
  the construction provisions of subchapter seventeen of this chapter.
    (f) In buildings classified in occupancy group J-1  or  J-2  not  more
  than  two  stories  in  height of combustible construction group II, the
  enclosing construction may have a one hour fire-resistance rating  which
  may  be  constructed  of  combustible  material; however, where only one
  vertical exit  is  provided  the  stair  enclosure  shall  be  protected
  throughout  with an automatic sprinkler system constructed in accordance
  with the provisions of subchapter seventeen of this chapter.
    (g) Except as provided in subparagraphs  (a),  (e)  and  (f)  of  this
