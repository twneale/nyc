Section 27-363

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 27-363 Remote location. (a) When more than one exit is required from
  a floor of a building, each such required exit shall be placed as remote
  from  the  others  as  is  practicable. Where this results in a distance
  between exits exceeding the maximum travel distances required by section
  27-357, additional remote vertical exits shall be provided.
    (b) In addition  to  the  requirements  of  subdivision  (a)  of  this
  section:
    (1)  For exits serving spaces classified in occupancy groups G or J-2,
  in no event shall such exits be less than fifteen feet distant from each
  other.
    (2) For exits serving spaces classified in other  occupancies,  in  no
  event  shall  such  distance  be  less than thirty feet or one-third the
  maximum  travel  distance  required  by  section  27-357,  whichever  is
  greater.
    (c) On any floor containing ten thousand square feet or more in a high
  rise  building classified in occupancy group E (office space), each exit
  that is required to be remote from another  exit  shall  not  share  any
  common  walls,  floors,  ceilings,  scissor  stair  assemblies, or other
  enclosures.
