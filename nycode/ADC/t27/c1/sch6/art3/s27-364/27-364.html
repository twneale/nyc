Section 27-364

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-364  Exit  discharge.  All  vertical  exits  shall  extend  in a
  continuous enclosure to discharge directly, or by way of a yard,  court,
  or  exit  passageway,  to  an  open  exterior space. When vertical exits
  serving floors above grade continue  in  the  same  enclosure  to  serve
  floors below grade, the portion of such vertical exits above grade shall
  be  separated  from  the  portion  below grade by construction having at
  least  a  one  hour  fire-resistance  rating,  with  three-quarter  hour
  self-closing  doors  opening  in  the  direction of exit travel from the
  floors below grade, except  that  buildings  classified  in  residential
  occupancy  group  J-3  and educational occupancy group G shall be exempt
  from this requirement.
