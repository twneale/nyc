    &sect;  27-383 Requirements. (a) Exit signs. Except in occupancy groups J-2
  and J-3, the location of every exit on every  floor  and  every  opening
  from  a  room  classified in occupancy group J-1 and containing cubicles
  shall be clearly indicated by exit signs. Such signs shall be placed  at
  an  angle  with  the  exit opening if such placement is required for the
  signs to serve their purpose. In long corridors, in  open  floor  areas,
  and  in  all  other situations where the location of the exit may not be
  readily visible or understood, directional signs shall  be  provided  to
  serve as guides from all portions of the corridor or floor.
    (b)  Exit path markings in high rise office buildings and in occupancy
  group E high rise buildings. On and after July 1,  2006  all  high  rise
  office  buildings  and  all  high rise buildings classified in occupancy
  group E shall have exit path markings conforming  to  this  subdivision.
  This  provision  shall  be  retroactive  and  shall  apply  to buildings
  constructed on and after such date and to buildings in existence on such
  date. All exit path markings required herein shall  be  of  an  approved
  photoluminescent  material.  The  markings shall be washable, non-toxic,
  non radioactive, and if subjected to fire  must  be  self  extinguishing
  when the flame is removed.
    (1)  All  doors  opening  to  corridors,  to  an  exit,  or to an exit
  passageway, shall be marked with the word "exit".
    (2)  Within  exit  stairs,  horizontal  extensions  in  exit   stairs,
  horizontal  exits,  supplemental  vertical  exits  and exit passageways,
  except within street level lobbies, there shall be directional markings.
    (3) Required markings for exit paths shall comply with  the  technical
  standards  for installation and placement to be set forth in a reference
  standard. Such reference standard shall be designated RS 6-1  and  shall
  be adopted on or before January 1, 2006.
