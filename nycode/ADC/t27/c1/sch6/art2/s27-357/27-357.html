Section 27-357

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 27-357 Exit requirements. The determination of exit requirements for
  a building shall be based upon the occupancy group classification of the
  building,  the  number of occupants, the floor area, the travel distance
  to an exit, and the capacity of the exits, as provided in table 6-1  and
  herein. Every floor of a building shall be provided with exit facilities
  for  its  occupant  load.  The  occupant  loads  of  floors shall not be
  cumulative for the purpose of designing vertical exits, except where one
  floor is used by another as a means of egress. Vertical  exits  provided
  from  any  floor  above  grade may serve simultaneously all floors above
  grade, and vertical exits provided from any floor below grade may  serve
  simultaneously all floors below grade.
    (a)  Mixed  occupancy.  When a building is classified in more than one
  occupancy group in accordance with the provisions of section  27-239  of
  article  two  of subchapter three of this chapter, the exit requirements
  for the entire  building  shall  be  determined  on  the  basis  of  the
  occupancy  group  having  the  strictest  exit requirements, or the exit
  requirements for each building section shall be determined separately.
    (b)  Incidental  occupancies.  When  a  building  contains  incidental
  occupancies  classified  in occupancy groups other than that under which
  the building is classified, the exit requirements for the floor on which
  such occupancies occur shall be based upon those of the occupancy  group
  under  which  the  building  is  classified;  but  the  access  and exit
  requirements for the  incidental  occupancy  shall  be  based  upon  the
  occupancy group classification of the incidental occupancy.
    (c)  Multiple  occupancy  or use. Where a building, floor, or space is
  used for multiple purposes involving different activities  at  different
  times,  that  occupancy involving the greatest number of occupants shall
  be used in determining the exit requirements.
    (d) Building access. All buildings classified in other than  occupancy
  groups  A,  mechanical  and  electrical  equipment  rooms and boiler and
  furnace rooms of D-2 or J-3 shall have at  least  one  primary  entrance
  accessible  to  and  usable  by  individuals  who  use wheelchairs. Such
  entrance shall provide access to a level that makes elevators  available
  in  buildings  where  elevators  are  provided.  Where ramps are used to
  comply with this requirement, they shall have a slope not  greater  than
  one  in twelve, and shall otherwise conform to the provisions of section
  27-377 and reference standard RS 4-6.
    The commissioner may waive the requirements of  this  section  in  the
  alteration  of  buildings existing on the effective date of this code in
  accordance with section 27-292.6 of this code.
 
    (For Table 6-1 see chapter 839 of the laws of 1986)
 
                           FOOTNOTES TO TABLE 6-1
    a. For method of measurement see subdivision (c) of section 27-360  of
  this article.
    b. Reduce  listed  capacity of ramps by twenty-five percent when slope
  exceeds 1 in 10.
    c. Except for public garages. (See article ten of subchapter seven  of
  this chapter.)
    d. There  shall  not  be  more  than  one  classroom on each side of a
  corridor between an exit and the end of the corridor (dead end).
    e. Applies to corridors serving classrooms. Other corridors shall have
  a minimum width of forty-four inches.
    f. Applies to corridors serving patients. Other corridors shall have a
  minimum width of forty-four inches.
    g. There shall be no patient bedrooms between an exit and the  end  of
  the corridor (dead end).

    h. See  subdivision  (d)  of  section  27-369  of article five of this
  subchapter for permissible increase.
    i. See section 27-369 of article five of this subchapter.

    k. See section 27-378 of article five of this subchapter.
    m. Where  a  door opening is divided by mullions into two or more door
  openings, each such opening shall be measured  separately  in  computing
  the number of units of exit width.
