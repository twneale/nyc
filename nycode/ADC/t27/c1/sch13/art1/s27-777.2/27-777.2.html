  building classified in occupancy group J-1, either seventy-five feet  or
  more in height or containing thirty or more sleeping rooms:
    (a)  Where  a corridor or space above a ceiling in a corridor is being
  used on or after February first, nineteen hundred eighty-four to furnish
  direct ventilation to a sleeping room or suite, such use  shall,  unless
  continued  use  is  permitted  by  the  commissioner, be discontinued by

    (b) All corridors and other public areas  not  provided  with  natural
  ventilation  meeting the requirements of section 27-761 of article eight
