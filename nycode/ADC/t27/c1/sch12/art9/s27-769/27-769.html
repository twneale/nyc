Section 27-769

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-769  Acoustical isolation of dwelling units. (a) Airborne noise.
  (1)  Walls,  partitions,  and  floor-ceiling  constructions   separating
  dwelling  units  from  each  other  or  from public halls, corridors, or
  stairs shall have a minimum sound transmission  class  (STC)  rating  of
  forty-five  for  airborne  noise.  This  requirement  shall not apply to
  dwelling unit entrance doors. However, such doors shall fit closely  and
  not  be  undercut.  For  permits  issued  after  January first, nineteen
  hundred seventy-two, the STC required shall be fifty for airborne noise.
  For   permits   issued   after   April   thirtieth,   nineteen   hundred
  seventy-three,  dwelling unit entrance doors shall have a minimum STC of
  thirty-five.
    (2) STC ratings shall be obtained by  tests  conducted  in  accordance
  with  the procedures of reference standard RS 12-2 except as provided in
  paragraph three of this subdivision.
    (3) The STC ratings of construction assemblies as listed in  reference
  standard  RS  12-2  may  be  used  to  determine  conformance  with  the
  requirements of paragraph one of this subdivision  and  with  any  other
  section that requires a specific STC rating.
    (4)  Penetrations or openings in walls, partitions, or floors for pipe
  sleeves, medicine cabinets, hampers, electric devices, or similar  items
  shall be packed, sealed, lined, back-plastered, or otherwise isolated by
  sufficient mass to maintain the required STC ratings.
    (5)  Where  grilles,  registers, or diffusers in one dwelling unit are
  connected by duct-work with grilles, registers, or diffusers in  another
  dwelling  unit,  and  where such connecting duct is less than seven feet
  long, it shall be lined with duct lining; otherwise, an  approved  sound
  attenuating device shall be installed therein. Duct lining shall conform
  to the requirements of subchapter thirteen of this chapter.
    (b)  Structure-borne noise. (1) Floor-ceiling constructions separating
  dwelling units from each other or from public halls or  corridors  shall
  have a minimum impact noise rating (INR) of zero.
    (2)  Such  INR shall be obtained by tests conducted in accordance with
  the procedure of reference  standard  RS  12-3  except  as  provided  in
  paragraph three of this subdivision.
    (3)  The  INR  of  floor-ceiling  constructions  listed  in  reference
  standard RS 12-3  shall  be  used  to  determine  conformance  with  the
  requirements  of  paragraph  one  of this subdivision and with any other
  paragraph that requires a specific INR. Constructions shall be  designed
  and  installed  to avoid short circuiting the isolation devices that are
  incorporated into the constructions.
    (4) This subdivision shall apply  only  to  construction  pursuant  to
  permits  issued after the thirty-first day of December, nineteen hundred
  seventy-six.
