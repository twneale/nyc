  pressure  levels,  in  octave  bands,  are  at least six db lower at all
  octave bands than the sound pressure levels measured with  the  exterior
  equipment  operating.  By  ambient  sound  pressure  levels is meant the
  measured  sound  pressure  levels,  at  the  above  described  measuring
  location, with the exterior equipment not in operation.
    b.  For  permits  issued  after  January   first,   nineteen   hundred
  seventy-two,  the  permitted  maximum  sound  power  levels for exterior
