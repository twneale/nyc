    &sect;  27-740  Heating  requirements. All habitable or occupiable rooms or
  spaces, and all other rooms or spaces listed in  table  12-1,  shall  be
  provided  with  means  of heating in accordance with the requirements of
  this subchapter and reference standard RS 12-1. Heating systems shall be
  capable of producing the required temperatures listed in table 12-1 when
  the outdoor temperature is five degrees Fahrenheit and the wind velocity
  is fifteen mph. In highly exposed locations, provision shall be made for
  higher wind velocities. Heating equipment shall  not  be  required  when
  either of the following conditions exist:
    (a)  Where  the  occupancy is seasonal and the rooms or buildings will
  not be occupied between November first and May first  of  the  following
  year.
    (b)  Where  the  processes or activities normally conducted within the
  space will generate sufficient heat to  produce  the  prescribed  indoor
  temperature during the time of occupancy.
