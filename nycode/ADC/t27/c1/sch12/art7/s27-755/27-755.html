Section 27-755

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-755  Use  of  adsorption  devices. In all cases where the use of
  recirculated air is permitted, the required outdoor air  supply  may  be
  reduced  up  to  fifty  per  cent, provided that the recirculated air is
  passed through adsorption  devices.  The  adsorption  devices  shall  be
  approved  and  rated.  Means  shall  be  provided  for  maintaining  the
  effectiveness of the adsorption devices.
    (a) Improper maintenance. Should the adsorption devices be  improperly
  maintained so that their effectiveness is impaired, the commissioner may
  order  their  removal.  If  the  adsorption devices are removed, the air
  conditioning  or  ventilating  system  shall  not  be  operated  without
  supplying  one  hundred  per  cent  of  the outdoor air required by this
  article or article eight of this subchapter.
    (b) Test records. The building owner shall, at all times,  maintain  a
  maintenance  record  showing  the  manufacturer's  recommendation of the
  frequency of tests, the method of making tests, and the results  of  all
  tests  of the adsorption devices. Such tests shall be made and certified
  by the manufacturer or by a laboratory acceptable to the commissioner at
  least twice every six  months.  The  records  of  such  tests  shall  be
  maintained  for  a  period of at least two years, and shall be available
  for inspection by the commissioner.
    (c) Ventilation of water closet compartments. The use  of  any  device
  that  returns  exhaust air from water closet compartments or from toilet
  rooms after passing through adsorption devices is  not  permitted  as  a
  means  of providing ventilation for a water closet compartment for which
  a mechanical system of ventilation is required.
