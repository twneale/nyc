Section 27-429

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-429 Coin-operated units. In coin-operated establishments all dry
  cleaning units shall be installed in such a manner that the  working  or
  maintenance  portion  of the equipment shall be separated from the front
  of the units by solid  noncombustible  partitions.  Coin-operated  units
  shall  be located within a diked area, all parts of which are impervious
  to the solvent used in such units. The diked section  shall  be  a  four
  inch  curb  above the floor. Provisions shall be made for the collection
  of solvent spillage into tanks of capacity sufficient to contain all  of
  the  solvent  in  the  dry  cleaning units served, and for return of the
  solvent to the cleaning units through a closed pipe system. Access doors
  to the space in back of the units  shall  be  kept  closed  and  locked.
  Solvent  storage  tanks and other sources of danger shall be so situated
  as to be  inaccessible  to  the  general  public.  In  addition  to  the
  mechanical   ventilation   required   for   low   hazard   dry  cleaning
  establishments, the following mechanical ventilation shall be provided:
    (a) All dry cleaning units shall have facilities that create an inward
  flow of one hundred cubic feet of air per minute into the unit when  the
  loading door is opened.
    (b)  Emergency  ventilation  of  the space in back of the dry cleaning
  units shall be provided so that in emergencies  a  minimum  of  one  air
  change  per  minute  in  the  enclosed space will be provided. Emergency
  ventilation equipment shall be on a circuit that is  separate  from  the
  general lighting and power circuits, and shall be taken off ahead of the
  main  switchboard, or shall be connected to the emergency lighting power
  source when such source is provided.
    (c) A scavenger duct system shall be provided in the space in back  of
  the  units  at  each  unit,  and  shall  be  designed  to  pick up vapor
  surrounding the equipment near the floor and exhaust it at the  rate  of
  one  hundred  cubic  feet  per minute. Scavenger ducts shall not be less
  than five square inches in area.
