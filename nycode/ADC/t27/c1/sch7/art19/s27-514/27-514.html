Section 27-514

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-514  Structural  requirements.  (a) Tents. Tents shall be guyed,
  supported, and braced to withstand a wind pressure  of  ten  pounds  per
  square  foot  of  projected  area  of  the  tent.  The  poles  and their
  supporting guys, stays, stakes, fastenings, etc. shall be of  sufficient
  strength  and  attached  so  as to resist wind pressure of twenty psf of
  projected area of the tent.
    (b) Air-supported structures.
    (1) Air-supported structures  shall  be  anchored  to  the  ground  or
  supporting   structure   by   either   ballast  or  positive  anchorage,
  sufficiently  and  evenly  distributed,  and  adequate  to  resist   the
  inflation  lift  load,  the  aerodynamic lift load, and the drag (shear)
  load due to wind impact. The latter factors shall be  based  on  a  wind
  velocity of at least seventy miles per hour, and an estimated stagnation
  of  not less than 0.5q for structures on grade whose height is equal to,
  or less than, the width of the structure. For greater  heights,  or  for
  elevated structures, increased anchorage shall be provided, justified by
  analytical and/or experimental data.
    (2)  The  skin  of  the  structure  shall be of such strength, and the
  joints so constructed, as to provide a minimum dead load  strip  tensile
  strength  at seventy degrees F of four times the seventy mph design load
  (inflation and aerodynamic loading). The joints  shall  provide  a  dead
  load  strip tensile strength of one hundred sixty degrees F of twice the
  seventy mph design load (i.e., a  factor  of  safety  of  four  and  two
  respectively).  In  addition,  the  material shall provide a trapezoidal
  tear strength of at least fifteen per cent of the maximum design tensile
  load. Material  and  joint  strengths  shall  be  so  certified  by  the
  manufacturer, justified by analytical and/or experimental data.
