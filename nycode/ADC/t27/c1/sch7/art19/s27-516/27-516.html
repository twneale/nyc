Section 27-516

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-516  Pressurization  system.  Air-supported  structures shall be
  inflated and shall remain inflated during all periods of occupancy to  a
  minimum  differential  pressure  of  0.88 in. and a maximum differential
  pressure of 1.50 in. of water. Ventilation  flow  per  occupant,  either
  through vents or anticipated leakage, shall comply with the requirements
  of subchapter twelve of this chapter.
    Occupied  spaces. Where the net floor area per occupant is one hundred
  fifty square feet or less, the structure shall be provided with at least
  two blowers, each of which shall have adequate capacity to maintain  the
  required  inflation  pressure.  Also,  an auxiliary engine-generator set
  capable of powering one blower, or a supplementary blower powered by  an
  internal  combustion  engine, either of which shall have the capacity to
  run continuously for four hours, shall be located outside the structure,
  shall be weather protected,  and  shall  be  arranged  to  automatically
  operate  the  blower  within  twenty  seconds upon failure of the normal
  source. Heat shall be provided from a source outside  the  structure  so
  arranged  as  to  prevent  the  spread  of  fire  to  the structure. The
  temperature within the air-supported structure shall  be  maintained  at
  the  temperature  required by subchapter twelve of this chapter, but not
  less than fifty degrees Fahrenheit during periods of snowfall.
