Section 27-410

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 27-410 Ventilation. Spraying or dipping spaces shall be mechanically
  ventilated during spraying or dipping operations so that the velocity of
  air is at least one hundred linear feet per minute in the breathing zone
  of  the operator, conveying air toward the exhaust hood. The ventilating
  system shall be of sufficient capacity to prevent  the  accumulation  of
  mist  or vapors. Air shall be admitted to the spraying or dipping spaces
  in an amount equal to the capacity of the fan or fans and  in  a  manner
  that  prevents  short-circuiting  the path of air in the working zone of
  such spaces. The exhaust fan control shall be interconnected with  spray
  guns  so  that  they  cannot  be operated without the ventilation system
  being in operation. Exhaust fans shall,  in  addition,  be  arranged  to
  operate independently of spray guns. Ventilation equipment shall be kept
  in  operation  for  sufficient  length of time after spraying or dipping
  operations to  exhaust  all  vapors,  fumes,  or  residues  of  spraying
  materials from the spray, space dip space, or drying room.
    (a)  Ventilating  ducts  shall  run  directly  to the outer air and be
  protected with a hood against the weather. Ventilating  ducts  shall  be
  installed  in accordance with the requirements of subchapter thirteen of
  this chapter, but shall not terminate within ten  feet  horizontally  of
  any  chimney outlet, or within twenty feet of any exit or any opening in
  an adjoining wall.
    (b) Make-up air shall be supplied from a point outside the spraying or
  dipping space.
    (c) The exhaust system from any  spraying,  dipping  or  drying  space
  shall  not be connected to any other ventilating system or be discharged
  into a chimney or flue used  for  the  purpose  of  conveying  gases  of
  combustion.
    (d)  Exhaust  fan  blades shall be constructed of nonferrous material.
  Fan blades not coming in direct contact with  spraying  fumes  need  not
  comply with this requirement.
    (e) Adequate access doors or panels, tightly fitted, shall be provided
  to permit inspection and cleaning of ducts.
