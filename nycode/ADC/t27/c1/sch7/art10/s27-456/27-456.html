Section 27-456

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 27-456 Ventilation. Public garages shall be ventilated in accordance
  with  provisions of section 27-766 of article eight of subchapter twelve
  of this chapter and the following:
    (a)  Garage  spaces  above  or  below  grade  except  as  provided  in
  subdivision  (e)  of  this  section  shall  be  provided with mechanical
  ventilation according to one  of  or  a  combination  of  the  following
  methods:
    (1)  Air  exhaust at the rate of not less than one cfm per square foot
  of total floor area with properly designed means for air inflow.
    (2) Air supply at the rate of not less than one cfm per square foot of
  total floor area with properly designed means for air outflow.
    (3) Air exhaust or air supply at a  rate  sufficient  to  maintain  an
  average concentration of carbon monoxide not to exceed one hundred parts
  per one million parts of air for periods longer than one hour and with a
  maximum  concentration  at  any time not to exceed four hundred parts of
  carbon monoxide per one million  parts  of  air.  The  concentration  of
  carbon  monoxide  shall  be  determined  by periodic tests taken between
  three and four feet from the floor by means of approved carbon  monoxide
  detector  tubes  or  other  equivalent  means. This method of mechanical
  ventilation may be used only if the overall  design  includes  automatic
  ventilating  fan control by means of approved carbon monoxide monitoring
  devices or by other  approved  means  located  so  as  to  provide  full
  protection for the occupancy.
    (b)  The  provisions  of section 27-766 of article eight of subchapter
  twelve of this chapter shall apply.
    (c) Air supply shall be taken from an uncontaminated  source.  Exhaust
  outlets  shall  be  located  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of
  subchapter thirteen with one-half of them located six inches above floor
  level. In public garages where motor vehicles are parked  by  mechanical
  means,  the ventilation requirements shall be one-half of those required
  above.
    (d) No automotive service pits shall be installed in floors below  the
  street  floor. Pits shall have mechanical exhaust ventilation taken from
  near the bottom.
    (e) Garage spaces above grade provided with natural ventilation having
  a free openable area of at least five per cent of the total  floor  area
  of  the  space  and  having  adjustable  openings measuring at least six
  inches by four inches located within six inches of the floor and at most
  sixteen feet apart on all outside and court walls need not  be  provided
  with mechanical ventilation.
