  is within five feet of any exterior window or any door which is used for
  entry or egress by the public to the building  or  structure;  provided,
  however, that tobacco product advertisements may be placed or maintained
  in  the  interior of any such premises where such advertisements are (i)
  parallel to the street and face inward, or (ii) affixed to a wall  panel
  or  similar  fixture  that  is perpendicular to the street regardless of
  whether such advertisements are illuminated or not illuminated.
    c. Nothing in this  section  shall  prevent  a  person  from  placing,
