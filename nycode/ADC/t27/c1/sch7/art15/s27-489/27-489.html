Section 27-489

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-489  Construction.  Pools shall be constructed so as to be water
  tight and easily cleaned. They shall be built of nonabsorbent  materials
  with smooth surfaces and shall be free of open cracks and open joints.
    (a)  Walls.  The walls of pools shall be vertical for at least the top
  two feet six inches below the normal water level. The junctions  between
  the  side  walls and the bottom shall be coved. A pool overflow shall be
  provided meeting the requirements of reference standard RS-16.
    (b) Bottom slopes. The bottom of any portion of a pool where the water
  is less than five feet six inches deep shall have a maximum slope of one
  foot vertically for every fifteen feet horizontally.
    (c) Ladders. There shall be a ladder or steps with  handrails  at  the
  deep  end  and at the shallow end of every pool. Ladders and steps shall
  have nonslip treads.
    (d) Walkways. Every pool shall have a walkway at least five feet  wide
  around  its  entire  perimeter. The walkway shall have a nonslip surface
  and be so constructed that it does not drain into the pool.
    (e) Hand-holds. Every pool shall be constructed  so  that  either  the
  overflow  gutter,  if  provided,  or  the top of the side walls afford a
  continuous hand-hold for bathers.
    (f) Markings. Permanent markings showing the depth of the shallow end,
  break points, diving depth, and deep end shall be provided so as  to  be
  visible from both inside and outside the pool.
    (g)  Spectator  area.  Areas exclusively intended for spectators shall
  meet the applicable requirements of subchapter eight of this chapter for
  places of assembly.
    (h)  Diving  boards  and  towers.  Diving  towers  shall  be   rigidly
  constructed  and  permanently  anchored.  The depth of the water below a
  diving board shall be at least eight feet  six  inches  for  boards  one
  meter  (3.28 ft.)   or less above the water. For diving boards more than
  one meter and not more than three meters (9 ft. 10 in.) above the water,
  the depth below the board shall be at  least  twelve  feet.  For  diving
  boards  or  platforms  more than three meters above the water, the depth
  below the board shall be at  least  sixteen  feet.  Indoor  pools  shall
  provide at least twelve feet overhead clearance above all diving boards.
