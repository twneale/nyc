Section 27-521.8

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 27-521.8 Smoke control. (a) In all atriums there shall be provided a
  system  of  mechanical  ventilation of sufficient capacity to exhaust at
  least six air changes per hour of the combined volumes of the atrium and
  all spaces with an open connection to the atrium, or 1 cfm/sq. ft.  from
  all  such  spaces,  whichever  is  greater,  using  either dedicated fan
  equipment or the building  ventilation  system  arranged  to  shut  down
  automatically,  with  manual  override  capability. Make-up air shall be
  supplied  at  the  lowest  level  of  an  atrium  at  a  rate  equal  to
  seventy-five percent of exhaust.
    (b)  All atriums shall have a gravity ventilation system equipped with
  remote manual controls to remove smoke if the mechanical exhaust  system
  fails.
    (c) A ventilation system serving an atrium shall not be interconnected
  with any other system serving another space.
    (d)  Ventilation  systems  supplying  occupied  spaces  shall  not  be
  interconnected with the general atrium supply.
