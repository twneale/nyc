    &sect;  27-521.15 Smoke control. (a) In all malls there shall be provided a
  system of mechanical ventilation of sufficient capacity  to  exhaust  at
  least  six  air changes per hour of the combined volumes of the mall and
  all spaces with an open connection to the mall, or 1  cfm/sq.  ft.  from
  all  such  spaces,  whichever  is  greater,  using  either dedicated fan
  equipment or the building  ventilation  system  arranged  to  shut  down
  automatically,  with  manual  override  capability. Make-up air shall be
  supplied at the lowest level of a mall at a rate equal  to  seventy-five
  per cent of exhaust.
    (b)  All  malls  shall have a gravity ventilation system equipped with
  remote manual controls to remove smoke if the mechanical exhaust  system
  fails.
    (c)  A  ventilation  system serving a mall shall not be interconnected
  with any other system serving another space.
    (d)  Ventilation  systems  supplying  occupied  spaces  shall  not  be
  interconnected with the general mall supply.
