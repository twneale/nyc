Section 27-417

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-417  Storage.  Radioactive  materials  shall be stored in sealed
  containers. When required by the commissioner to avoid too  concentrated
  an  exposure within any one space, radioactive materials shall be stored
  in vaults designed in accordance with the radiation shielding  or  other
  requirements  for  the  materials  to  be stored. When any materials are
  subject to melting, vaporization, or oxidation  under  fire  conditions,
  the   storage   vaults   shall   be   constructed   of  walls  having  a
  fire-resistance rating of at least four hours, and the vaults  shall  be
  equipped  with  automatic  sprinklers  complying  with  the construction
  requirements of subchapter seventeen of this chapter and shall be vented
  through devices to decontaminate the air to a safe level. Doors  opening
  into  storage  vaults  shall  meet  shielding  requirements  and  have a
  fire-protection rating of not less than three hours. All bins, shelving,
  partitions, and pallets in storage vaults  shall  be  of  noncombustible
  materials.  Other  methods of storage permitted by the health department
  or the atomic energy commission, such as storage  under  water,  may  be
  used.
