Section 27-711

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-711  Steel H sections. (a) Materials. Steel H sections may be of
  any type of steel permitted by the provisions of reference  standard  RS
  10-5.    The use of built-up sections or sections of other than "H" form
  will  be  permitted  if  the  several  components  of  the  section  are
  adequately  connected to develop the strength of the adjacent components
  and if the ratio of width to thickness of the component parts  does  not
  exceed the values for conventional "H" sections.
    (b)  Limitations  on  use.  The  tips  of  all  steel H piles having a
  thickness of metal less than one-half inch,  which  are  driven  to  end
  bearing on rock of class 1-65 through 3-65 by an impact hammer, shall be
  reinforced.  The  installation  of all steel H piles by impact hammer to
  end bearing on rock of classes 1-65 through  3-65  shall  be  under  the
  personal  inspection  of an architect or engineer, and the operations of
  driving such piles, the observations of penetration resistance, and  the
  operation of the equipment shall be conducted so as to terminate driving
  directly when the pile reaches refusal on the rock surface.
