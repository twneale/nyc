Section 27-669

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-669  Pile  reactions.  The  loads  to  be used in computing pile
  reactions shall be determined as provided  in  section  27-668  of  this
  article  except  that  where  piles penetrate fill, clay, silt, peat, or
  similar compressible strata, the pile loads shall be  increased  by  the
  amount  of  drag exerted by such material, and by any overlaying strata,
  during consolidation. Computation of the amount of drag  shall  consider
  the  amount  of  added fill, the amount of shear strain between pile (or
  group) and the soil, the ratio of vertical to horizontal pressure in the
  soil, and  the  arrangement  of  the  piles.  The  soil  surrounding  or
  underlying  the  pile  cap  shall  not  be  considered  as providing any
  vertical support for the cap.
