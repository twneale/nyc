Section 27-671

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-671  Eccentricities.  Eccentricity  of  loading  in foundations,
  including eccentricity of loading on the bases of retaining walls, shall
  be investigated and the maximum soil pressure or pile load  (considering
  eccentricity)  shall  be  kept  within  the  safe  capacity  thereof  as
  established in articles four and eight of this subchapter. Soil pressure
  and pile load due to eccentricity shall be  computed  on  the  basis  of
  straight  line distribution of foundation reaction. However, other modes
  of distribution of the foundation reaction may be  assumed,  subject  to
  the  approval  of  the  commissioner, if it can be demonstrated that the
  pile and/or soil is capable of sufficient plastic deformation to develop
  such mode of distribution without failure.
