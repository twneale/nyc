Section 27-723

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-723  Subgrade  for  footings,  foundation  piers, and foundation
  walls.   The soil  material  directly  underlying  footings,  foundation
  piers,  and  foundation  walls  shall  be  inspected  by an architect or
  engineer after excavation and immediately prior to construction  of  the
  footings.  If  such inspection indicates that the soil conditions do not
  conform to those assumed for purposes of design  and  described  on  the
  plans,  or  are  unsatisfactory  due  to  disturbance,  then  additional
  excavation, reduction in allowable bearing pressure, or  other  remedial
  measures shall be adopted, as required. A copy of a report or reports on
  such  inspection  or inspections describing the conditions found and any
  necessary modification of the design, and bearing the signature  of  the
  architect  or  engineer  making the inspections, shall be filed with the
  commissioner.  In  addition,  notification  shall  be  received  by  the
  department  at  least  two  working  days  prior  to construction of the
  footing, pier, or foundation walls,  that  the  subgrade  is  ready  for
  inspection   unless  the  requirements  of  section  27-209  of  article
  twenty-one of subchapter one of this chapter have been met.
