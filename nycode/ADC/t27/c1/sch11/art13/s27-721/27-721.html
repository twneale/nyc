Section 27-721

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-721  Piling.  The installation of all piling shall be subject to
  controlled inspection. Such inspection shall be  performed  only  by  an
  architect  or engineer resident at the site, except that where more than
  one pile rig is working at  a  site,  inspection  of  the  work  may  be
  performed  by  nonlicensed  or nonregistered personnel working under the
  resident architect or engineer, who  need  act  only  in  a  supervisory
  capacity.  This  exception  shall  not  apply,  however, in the cases of
  timber or steel piles driven to end bearing as described in article  ten
  of  this subchapter. Materials for piling shall be subject to inspection
  requirements as prescribed in subchapter ten of this chapter  for  those
  or  like  materials.  In  all  cases,  an inspector shall be assigned to
  observe the operations of each rig.
