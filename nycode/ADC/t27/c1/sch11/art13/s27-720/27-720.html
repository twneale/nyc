Section 27-720

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-720  Boring  and  test  pit  operations.  Boring  and  test  pit
  operations shall be subject to controlled inspection, except that  fifty
  per  cent or less of the required number of borings and/or test pits may
  be inspected by an architect or engineer other  than  the  architect  or
  engineer  designated  for  controlled inspection. The records of borings
  and/or test pits shall be attested to as follows:
    (a) The architect or  engineer  shall  file  a  report  stating  which
  borings  and/or test pits were performed under his or her inspection and
  whether such inspection was performed personally or  otherwise.  If  the
  inspection  was  not  made  personally by the architect or engineer, the
  name and address of the inspector shall be noted. It  shall  be  stated:
  that  the  borings  and/or  test  pits  so  inspected were made and were
  carried to the depths indicated; that, to the best of the architect's or
  engineer's knowledge and belief, the description and  classification  of
  the  soils  are  a  true  description  of the samples recovered from the
  respective borings and/or test pits; that such samples were recovered at
  the  levels  indicated;  and  that  the  boring  and/or  test  pit  work
  progressed  in  such  manner  that  the samples recovered are reasonably
  representative of the subsurface conditions.
    (b) The accuracy of the other data indicated  on  the  boring  records
  shall be attested to by the drilling contractor or by the driller making
  the borings.
