Section 27-701

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 27-701 Allowable lateral load. For plumb piles fully embedded in the
  ground, the lateral load applied at the top of the pile shall not exceed
  one  ton per pile unless it has been demonstrated by tests that the pile
  will resist a lateral load of two  hundred  per  cent  of  the  proposed
  working  lateral  load without lateral movement of more than one inch at
  the ground level and will  resist  the  proposed  working  lateral  load
  without  a  movement of more than three-eighths of an inch at the ground
  level. For piles projecting above the ground level the shear and bending
  stresses computed on the basis of cantilever action to a level  of  five
  feet  below grade in soils of class 8-65 or better and to ten feet below
  grade in poorer soils shall not exceed the  allowable  values  for  like
  materials  established in subchapter ten of this chapter. The provisions
  of subdivision (f)  of  section  27-700  of  this  article  relating  to
  combination of loads shall apply.
