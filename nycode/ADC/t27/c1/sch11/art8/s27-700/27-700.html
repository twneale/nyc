Section 27-700

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-700  Allowable  axial  load.  The allowable axial load on a pile
  shall be the least value permitted by  consideration  of  the  following
  factors  (for  battered piles, the axial load shall be computed from the
  resultant  of  all  vertical  loads   and   lateral   forces   occurring
  simultaneously):
    1. The capacity of the pile as a structural member.
    2.  The  allowable bearing pressure on soil strata underlying the pile
  tips.
    3. The resistance to penetration of the piles, including resistance to
  driving, resistance to jacking,  the  rate  of  penetration,  or  other,
  equivalent criteria as established in this section.
    4.  The  capacity  as  indicated  by  load  test, where load tests are
  required.
    5. The maximum loads prescribed in subdivision (e) of this section.
    (a) The capacity of the pile as a structural member.
    (1) EMBEDDED PORTION OF THE PILE. The compressive stress on any  cross
  section  of  a  pile produced by that portion of the design load that is
  considered to be transmitted  to  that  section  shall  not  exceed  the
  allowable  values for the construction materials as established in table
  11-3. The tensile stress shall not  exceed  the  values  established  in
  subchapter ten of this chapter for like material.
    (2) PORTION OF THE PILE THAT IS NOT EMBEDDED. That portion of any pile
  that  is  free standing in air or water shall be designed as a column in
  accordance with the provisions of subchapter ten of this chapter,  fixed
  at a point five feet below the soil contact level in class 8-65 material
  or  better  and  ten feet below in any other material. The conditions of
  lateral and rotational restraint  offered  by  the  pile  cap  shall  be
  considered in determining the equivalent unbraced length.
    (3)  LOAD DISTRIBUTION ALONG EMBEDDED PORTION OF THE PILE. The portion
  of the design load  acting  on  any  cross-section  of  a  pile  may  be
  determined   by   analysis,   considering   time  dependent  changes  in
  distribution of the load. As an alternative method for the  purposes  of
  this section, it may be assumed that:
    a.  For  piles embedded forty feet or more in materials of class 10-65
  or better, or in controlled fills, and bearing on  or  in  materials  of
  classes 1-65 to 5-65: seventy-five per cent of the load shall be assumed
  to  be carried by the tip. For shorter piles, with similar conditions of
  embedment and bearing, one hundred per cent of the load shall be assumed
  carried by the tip.
    b. For piles embedded in materials of class 10-65  or  better,  or  in
  controlled  fills,  and  bearing  on  or in materials of classes 6-65 to
  10-65 (or controlled fills): the full load shall be assumed to act at  a
  cross  section  located at two-thirds of the embedded length of the pile
  measured up from the tip. Where tapered piles are used,  the  stress  at
  all  sections of the pile shall be determined on the basis that the full
  load acts at a location as described above and  that  one-third  of  the
  full load acts at the tip. The stresses so computed shall not exceed the
  allowable values in table 11-3.
    c.  For  conditions  not  covered  in  subparagraphs  a  and b of this
  paragraph three the provisions relating to analysis shall apply.

  ========================================================================
  Pile Material                 Allowable Compressive Stress
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Concrete       Concrete--The provisions of Reference Standard RS 10-3
                   relating to short compression members shall apply. For
                   working stress design use 0.25f'c. For ultimate

                   strength design use minimum eccentricity of 5 per cent,
                   phi = 0.70 (phi = 0.75 where a permanent metal shell
                   having a minimum wall thickness of 1/8 inch is used),
                   and load factors as specified in Reference Standard RS
                   10-3. The above provisions shall be deemed applicable
                   to reinforced and unreinforced sections. For
                   unreinforced sections use Ds = D and d = t (symbols
                   refer to those used in Reference Standard RS 10-3).
                 Reinforcing steel--0.40fy but not greater than 30,000
                   psi. (The provisions of article five of subchapter
                   ten of this chapter relating to ties, spirals, and
                   percentages of reinforcing steel for reinforced
                   concrete compression members shall apply.)
  Timber         See timber piles (section 27-707 of article eight of
                   this subchapter)
  Steel          H piles--0.35fy, with fy not to be taken as greater
                   than 36,000 psi. Minimum thickness of metal shall
                   be 0.40.
                 Pipe piles, shells for cast-in place concrete piles
                   and shells of pipe sections used in caisson piles:
                   0.35fy, (fy not to be taken as greater than 36,000
                   psi.) for thickness of 1/8 in. or more. Metal thinner
                   than 1/8 in. shall not be considered as contributing
                   to the structural strength of the pile section.
                 Core sections for caisson piles: 0.50fy with fy not to
                   be taken as greater than 36,000 psi.
  ========================================================================
  Note:
    f'c = 28 day compressive strength of concrete.
    fy  = Minimum specified yield strength of steel.
 
    (b)  Allowable  bearing  pressure  on  soil strata underlying the pile
  tips.
    (1) BEARING CAPACITY. The allowable pile load shall be limited by  the
  provision  that  the  pressures in materials at and below the pile tips,
  produced by the loads on individual piles and by the  aggregate  of  all
  piles  in  a group or foundation, shall not exceed the allowable bearing
  values established in article four of this subchapter. The provisions of
  section 27-678 and 27-679 of  article  four  of  this  subchapter  shall
  apply.  The transfer of load from piles to soil shall be determined by a
  recognized method of analysis. As an alternative, for purposes  of  this
  section,  piles or pile groups may be assumed to transfer their loads to
  the underlying materials by spreading the load uniformly at an angle  of
  sixty  degrees with the horizontal, starting at a polygon circumscribing
  the piles, located as follows:
    a. For piles embedded entirely in materials of classes 4-65  to  8-65,
  or in controlled fill materials, the polygon shall be circumscribed at a
  level located two-thirds of the embedded length of the pile, measured up
  from the tip.
    b.  For  piles  penetrating  through  soils of classes 9-65, 10-65, or
  11-65 into bearing in soils of class 8-65 or better, the  polygon  shall
  be  circumscribed  at  the  bottom of the strata of class 9-65, 10-65 or
  11-65 materials.
    c.  In  the  case  of  piles  having  enlarged  bases,   the   lateral
  distribution  of  the  load  to  the soil may be assumed to begin at the
  junction of the shaft and the enlarged base and to extend as follows:
    1. In the case where the enlarged base is formed in  loose  or  medium
  compact  (N  value  less  than  thirty) soils of class 6-65 or 7-65 that

  extend twenty feet or more below the junction of the base and shaft,  or
  that  are  of  lesser extent but are directly underlain by soil of class
  5-65 or better, the bearing area may be taken at a plane six feet  below
  said  junction but not lower than the bottom of the soil strata of class
  6-65 or 7-65.
    2. Where the enlarged base is formed in compact  (N  value  thirty  to
  sixty) soils of class 6-65 or 7-65, or in any soil of these classes that
  extends  less  than  twenty  feet below the junction of the base and the
  shaft and that is underlain by soil of class 8-65 or poorer, the bearing
  area shall be taken at planes less than six feet  below  said  junction,
  with  a  lower limit of three feet where the material is very compact (N
  value sixty, or greater) and the  extent  of  the  class  6-65  or  7-65
  material  is  ten  feet  below  the  junction  of  shaft  and base. (The
  provisions of subdivision (e) of section 27-710 of article ten  of  this
  subchapter  relating  to  minimum  depth  of  bearing  stratum below the
  junction of base and shaft shall  apply.)  For  conditions  intermediate
  between  that described in clause one of this subparagraph and the lower
  limit conditions described here, the location of the bearing area may be
  determined by linear interpolation between the  indicated  limits  of  N
  value  and  extent  of  bearing material below the junction of shaft and
  base, giving equal weight to both variables.
    3. Where the enlarged base is formed in or on soils of class  4-65  or
  5-65,  the  bearing area shall be taken at a depth below the junction of
  the shaft and base consonant with the size and depth of the base formed,
  and as evaluated from the required test piles.
    d. For all piles bearing on soils of classes 1-65 to 3-65, analysis of
  load distribution will not be required if the requirements  relating  to
  capacity   of  the  pile  as  a  structural  member,  to  resistance  to
  penetration, to load test where required, and to maximum tabulated loads
  are satisfied.
    e. For piles bearing in soils of classes 9-65 and 10-65, for cases not
  described above, or for any case where the method of installing the pile
  utilizes a temporary casing, the provision relating  to  analysis  shall
  apply.
    f.  In no case shall the area considered as supporting the load extend
  beyond the intersection of the sixty degree planes of adjacent piles  or
  pile groups.
    (2)  BEARING STRATUM. The plans for the proposed work shall establish,
  in accordance  with  the  requirements  relating  to  allowable  bearing
  pressure,  the bearing strata to which the piles in the various sections
  of the building are to be penetrated and the approximate  elevations  of
  the  top  of  such bearing strata. Where penetration of a given distance
  into the bearing strata is required for  adequate  distribution  of  the
  loads,  such  penetration  shall  be  shown  on the plans. The indicated
  elevations of the top of the bearing strata shall be  modified  by  such
  additional  data as may be obtained during construction. All piles shall
  penetrate to or into the designated bearing strata.
    (c)  Capacity  as  indicated  by  resistance  to  penetration.   Where
  subsurface   investigation,   as   described  in  article  two  of  this
  subchapter, or general experience in the area, indicates that  the  soil
  that  must  be  penetrated  by  the  pile  consists  of glacial deposits
  containing boulders, or fills  containing  riprap,  excavated  detritus,
  masonry,  concrete,  or  other  obstructions  in  sufficient  numbers to
  present a hazard to the installation of the piles, the selection of type
  of pile and penetration criteria shall be subject to the approval of the
  commissioner but in no case shall the minimum penetration resistance  be
  less than that stipulated in Tables 11-4 and 11-5.

            (For Table 11-4 see chapter 839 of the laws of 1986)
 
  Notes:
    a Final  driving  resistance shall be the sum of tabulated values plus
  resistance exerted by non-bearing materials. The driving  resistance  of
  non-bearing  materials  shall  be taken as the resistance experienced by
  the pile during driving, but which will be dissipated with time and  may
  be  approximated  as  described  in  subparagraph  a of paragraph one of
  subdivision (c) of this section.
    b The hammer energy indicated is the rated energy.
    c Sustained driving  resistance--where  piles  are  to  bear  in  soil
  classes   4-65  and  5-65,  the  minimum  driving  resistance  shall  be
  maintained for the last six inches, unless a  higher  sustained  driving
  resistance  requirement  is established by load test. Where piles are to
  bear in soil classes 6-65 through 10-65, the minimum driving  resistance
  shall  be  maintained  for  the  last  twelve inches unless load testing
  demonstrates a requirement for higher sustained driving  resistance.  No
  pile  need  be driven to a resistance to penetration (in blows per inch)
  more than twice the resistance indicated in this table, nor  beyond  the
  point  at  which there is no measurable net penetration under the hammer
  blow.
    d The tabulated values assume that the ratio of total weight  of  pile
  to  weight  of  striking part of hammer does not exceed 3.5. If a larger
  ratio is to be used, or for other conditions for  which  no  values  are
  tabulated,   the   driving  resistance  shall  be  as  approved  by  the
  commissioner.
    e For intermediate values of pile capacity, minimum  requirements  for
  driving resistance may be determined by straight line interpolation.

  Notes:
    {1} The  driving  resistance  exerted  by non-bearing materials is the
  resistance experienced by the pile during driving,  but  which  will  be
  dissipated   with   time   and  may  be  approximated  as  described  in
  subparagraph a of paragraph one of subdivision (c) of this section.
    {2} The hammer energy indicated is the rated energy.
    {3} Sustained driving resistance. Where piles  are  to  bear  in  soil
  classes   4-65  and  5-65,  the  minimum  driving  resistance  shall  be
  maintained for the last six inches, unless a  higher  sustained  driving
  resistance  requirement  is established by load test. Where piles are to
  bear in soil classes 6-65 thru 10-65,  the  minimum  driving  resistance

  measured  in  blows  per  inch  shall  be maintained for the last twelve
  inches  unless  load  testing  demonstrates  a  requirement  for  higher
  sustained  driving resistance. No pile need be driven to a resistance to
  penetration (in blows per inch) more than twice the resistance indicated
  in  this  table nor beyond the point at which there is no measurable net
  penetration under the hammer blow.
    {4} The  minimum  driving  resistance  shall  be  determined  by   the
  following formula:
 
             (For Equations see chapter 907 of the laws of 1985)
 
    (1)   PILES   INSTALLED   BY   USE   OF   STEAM-POWERED,  AIR-POWERED,
  DIESEL-POWERED OR HYDRAULIC IMPACT HAMMERS.
    a. The minimum required driving resistance and  the  requirements  for
  hammer  energies  for various types and capacities of piles are given in
  tables 11-4 and 11-5. To obtain the required total  driving  resistance,
  the  indicated  driving  resistances  shall  be  added  to  any  driving
  resistance experienced by the pile during installation, but  which  will
  be  dissipated with time (resistance exerted by non-bearing materials or
  by materials which are to be excavated). For purposes of  this  section,
  the  resistance  exerted by non-bearing materials may be approximated as
  the resistance to penetration of the pile recorded  when  the  pile  has
  penetrated   to   the   bottom   of  the  lowest  stratum  of  nominally
  unsatisfactory bearing material (class 11-65, but not  controlled  fill)
  or  to  the  bottom  of  the lowest stratum of soft or loose deposits of
  class 9-65 or 10-65 but only where such strata are completely penetrated
  by the pile. The provisions of articles nine and ten of this  subchapter
  shall also apply.
    b.  Alternate  for similitude method. The requirement for installation
  of piling to the penetration resistances given in tables 11-4  and  11-5
  will be waived where the following five conditions prevail:
    1. The piles bear on, or in, soil of class 5-65 through class 10-65.
    2.  The stratigraphy, as defined by not less than one boring for every
  sixteen hundred square  feet  of  building  area,  shall  be  reasonably
  uniform or divisible into areas of uniform conditions.
    3. Regardless of pile type or capacity, one load test, as described in
  subdivision  (d)  of  this  section,  shall be conducted in each area of
  uniform conditions, but not less than two typical piles for  the  entire
  foundation  installation  of  the  building or group of buildings on the
  site, nor less than one pile for every fifteen thousand square  feet  of
  pile foundation area shall be load tested.
    4.  Except  as  permitted  by  the  provisions  of  clause six of this
  subparagraph, all building piles within the area of influence of a given
  load-tested pile of satisfactory performance shall be installed  to  the
  same  or  greater driving resistance as the successful load-tested pile.
  The same or heavier equipment of the same type that was used to  install
  the  load-tested pile shall be used to install all other building piles,
  and the equipment shall be operated identically. Also, all  other  piles
  shall  be  of  the  same  type,  shape, external dimension, and equal or
  greater cross-section as the load-tested pile. All building piles within
  the area of influence represented by a  given  satisfactory  load-tested
  pile  shall  bear  in,  or  on the same bearing stratum as the load test
  pile.
    5.  A  report  by  an  architect  or  engineer  shall   be   submitted
  establishing  to  the  satisfaction  of  the commissioner, that the soil
  bearing pressures do not exceed the values permitted by  the  provisions
  of  article  four  of this subchapter and that the probable differential

  settlements will not cause stress conditions in the building  in  excess
  of those permitted by the provisions of subchapter ten of this chapter.
    6.  Where  the  structure of the building or the spacing and length of
  the piling is such as to cause the building and its foundation to act as
  an essentially rigid body, the building piles may be  driven  to  length
  and/or   penetration   into   the  bearing  stratum  without  regard  to
  penetration resistance, subject to the requirement  of  clause  five  of
  this subparagraph, relating to submission of report.
    (2)  PILES  INSTALLED  BY JACKING OR OTHER STATIC FORCES. The carrying
  capacity of a pile installed by jacking or other static forces shall  be
  not  more  than  fifty per cent of the load or force used to install the
  pile to the required penetration, except for piles jacked into  position
  for  underpinning.  The  working  load  of a temporary underpinning pile
  shall not exceed the total  jacking  force  at  final  penetration.  The
  working  load  of  each permanent underpinning pile shall not exceed the
  larger of the following values: two-thirds of the  total  jacking  force
  used to obtain the required penetration if the load is held constant for
  seven  hours  without  measurable  settlement;  or one-half of the total
  jacking force at final penetration if the load is held for a  period  of
  one  hour  without measurable settlement. The jacking resistance used to
  determine the working load shall not include the resistance  offered  by
  non-bearing materials which will be dissipated with time.
    (3)  PILES INSTALLED BY USE OF VIBRATORY HAMMER. The capacity of piles
  installed by vibratory hammer shall not exceed the value established  on
  the principle of similitude, as follows:
    a.  Comparison piles, as required by the provisions of subdivision (d)
  of this section, shall be installed using an impact hammer  and  driving
  resistances  corresponding to the proposed pile capacities as determined
  in paragraph one of subdivision (c) of this section or to tip elevations
  and driving resistances as determined by the architect or engineer.
    b. For each comparison pile, install an identical index pile by use of
  the vibratory hammer at a location at least four feet, but not more than
  six feet, from each comparison pile. The index piles shall be  installed
  to  the same tip elevation as the comparison pile, except that where the
  comparison piles bear on soils of classes 1-65 to 5-65, the index  piles
  shall  bear  in, or on, similar material. All driving data for the index
  pile shall be recorded.
    c. The index piles  shall  be  load  tested  in  accordance  with  the
  provisions of subdivision (d) of this section. Should the specified load
  test  criteria indicate inadequate capacity of the index piles, steps a,
  b, and c shall be repeated using  longer,  larger,  or  other  types  of
  piles.
    d.  All  building  piles  within  the  area  of  influence of a given,
  satisfactorily tested index pile shall  be  installed  to  the  same  or
  lesser  rate  of  penetration  (in. per min.) as of the successful index
  pile. The same equipment that  was  used  to  install  the  index  pile,
  identically  operated  as to rpm, manifold pressure, etc., shall be used
  to install the building piles. Also, all building piles shall be of  the
  same  type, size, and shape as the index pile. All building piles within
  the area of influence as represented by a  given  satisfactorily  tested
  index  pile  shall bear in, or on, the same bearing stratum as the index
  pile.

    (d)  Capacity  as indicated by load test. Load test of piling shall be
  required as follows:
    (1) PILES INSTALLED BY STATIC FORCES. The load bearing capacity of all
  types and capacities of piles installed by  static  forces,  other  than
  caisson  piles  and  underpinning  piles,  shall be demonstrated by load
  test.
    (2) PILES DRIVEN BY IMPACT HAMMERS. The load bearing capacity of piles
  installed by impact hammers shall be demonstrated by load test when  the
  proposed pile capacity exceeds the following values:
    a. Caisson piles.--No load test required.
    b.  Piles installed open end to rock of class 1-65, 2-65 or 3-65-- one
  hundred tons, except as provided in subparagraph d  of  this  paragraph,
  and  except  that  no  load  tests  will be required for piles up to two
  hundred tons capacity wherein the pile load does not exceed  eighty  per
  cent  of  the  load  determined on the basis of limiting stresses in the
  pile materials and provided that the pipe or  shell  be  driven  to  the
  resistance indicated in table 11--4.
    c.  Piles bearing on rock or hardpan (soil classes 1-65 to 5-65) other
  than as described in subparagraph b of this  paragraph,  and  except  as
  provided in subparagraph d of this paragraph--forty tons.
    d.  Piles  bearing  on materials of class eight or better, wherein, on
  the assumption that one hundred per cent of the load  reaches  the  pile
  tip,  (or, in case of piles having an enlarged base or other enlargement
  of the bearing area, the top of the enlargement) the bearing pressure on
  the soil underlying the tips or bases can be demonstrated to be equal to
  or less than the values of basic allowable pressure indicated  in  table
  11-2--provided  that  the  class  and  density  of  the bearing material
  supporting the piles be confirmed by not less than one  boring  at  each
  column location, then the commissioner may reduce the required number of
  load tests.

    e. All other types of piles--thirty tons.
    (3)  PILES  INSTALLED  BY  USE  OF VIBRATORY HAMMERS. The load bearing
  capacity of all types and capacities of piles (other than caisson piles)
  shall be demonstrated by load test.
    (4) LOAD TEST PROCEDURES. Before any load test is made,  the  proposed
  apparatus  and  structure  to  be  used in making the load test shall be
  satisfactory to the commissioner and when required by him  or  her,  all
  load  tests  shall be made under the commissioner's surveillance or that
  of his or her representative. A complete record of such tests  shall  be
  filed with the commissioner.
    a.  Areas  of  the  foundation  site  within which the subsurface soil
  conditions are substantially similar in character shall be  established.
  In  addition,  for  friction  piles bearing on, or on, soil materials of
  class 6-65, or poorer,  the  uniformity  of  each  such  area  shall  be
  verified   by   installing   at   least  three  penetration-test  piles,
  distributed over the area. Continuous records of penetration  resistance
  shall  be  made for such piles. If the records of penetration resistance
  are not similar or are not in reasonable agreement with the  information
  obtained  from  the  borings,  the  assumed  areas of similar subsurface
  conditions shall be modified in accordance with the information  derived
  from  the  penetration-test  piles and additional penetration-test piles
  shall be installed as required to verify the uniformity of such areas.
    b. For piles installed by jacking or other static forces or by  impact
  hammer,  one  load  test  shall  be  conducted  in  each area of uniform
  conditions,  but  not  less  than  two  typical  piles  for  the  entire
  foundation  installation  of  the  building or group of buildings on the
  site, and not less than one pile for each fifteen thousand  square  feet
  of  the  area of the building wherein said piles are to be used shall be
  load tested. For piles  installed  by  use  of  vibratory  hammers,  one
  comparison  pile  shall  be  installed  and one index pile shall be load
  tested in each area of uniform conditions, but not less than  two  index
  piles  shall  be  tested  for  the entire foundation installation of the
  building or group of buildings on the site, nor less than one index pile
  be tested for every seventy-five hundred square feet of pile  foundation
  area. For piles whose capacity is determined on the basis of similitude,
  the  provisions of subparagraph b of paragraph one of subdivision (c) of
  this section shall apply.
    c. The load test shall be conducted by a  method  that  will  maintain
  constant load under increasing settlement. Settlement observations shall
  be  made by means of dial extensometers. The extensometers shall provide
  readings to the nearest one one-thousandth  of  an  inch.  In  addition,
  settlement observations shall be taken using an engineer's level reading
  to   one   one-thousandth   of   a   foot,   properly  referenced  to  a
  well-established benchmark.
    1. Test loads shall be applied by direct  weight  or  by  means  of  a
  hydraulic   jack.  The  loading  platform  or  box  shall  be  carefully
  constructed to provide a concentric load on the pile. If  direct  weight
  is  employed,  the loading increments shall be applied without impact or
  jar. The weight of the loading platform or box shall be  obtained  prior
  to  the  test and this weight shall be considered as the first increment
  of load. If a hydraulic jack is  employed,  facilities  for  maintaining
  each  increment  of  desired  load  constant under increasing settlement
  shall be provided. The gauge and the jack shall be calibrated as a  unit
  for each project.
    2. The test load shall be twice the proposed working load of the pile.
  The  test  load  shall be applied in seven increments at a load of fifty
  per cent, seventy-five per cent,  one  hundred  per  cent,  one  hundred
  twenty-five   per   cent,  one  hundred  fifty  per  cent,  one  hundred

  seventy-five per cent, and two hundred per cent of the proposed  working
  load.  After  the  proposed  working  load has been applied and for each
  increment thereafter, the test load shall remain in place until there is
  no measurable settlement in a two hour period. The total test load shall
  remain in place until settlement does not exceed one one-thousandth of a
  foot in forty-eight hours. The total load shall be removed in decrements
  not  exceeding  twenty-five  per  cent  of  the  total  load at one hour
  intervals or longer. The rebound shall be recorded after each  decrement
  is  removed,  and  the final rebound shall be recorded twenty-four hours
  after the entire test load has been removed.
    3. Under each load increment, settlement observations  shall  be  made
  and  recorded at one-half minute, one minute, two minutes, four minutes,
  and each four minutes thereafter after application  of  load  increment,
  except  in  the  instance of the total load where, after the four minute
  reading, the time interval shall be successively doubled until the final
  settlement limitation is reached and the load is removed.
    4. The allowable pile load shall be  the  lesser  of  the  two  values
  computed as follows:
    (a)  Fifty  (50) per cent of the applied load causing a net settlement
  of the pile of not more than one one-hundredth of an  inch  per  ton  of
  applied  load.  Net  settlement in this paragraph means gross settlement
  due to the total test load minus the rebound after removing one  hundred
  per cent of the test load.
    (b)  Fifty  (50) per cent of the applied load causing a net settlement
  of the pile of  three-quarters  of  an  inch.  Net  settlement  in  this
  paragraph  means  the  gross  settlement  as defined in subclause (a) of
  clause 4 of this subparagraph, less the amount of elastic shortening  in
  the pile section due to total test load.
    (5) FOUNDATION PILES. Except as provided in clause six of subparagraph
  b  of  paragraph  one  of  subdivision (c) of this section, all building
  piles within the area of  influence  of  a  given  load-tested  pile  of
  satisfactory  performance,  shall  be  installed  to the same or greater
  penetration resistance (or static load) as  the  successful  load-tested
  pile.  The  same  equipment (or heavier equipment of the same type) that
  was used to install the load-tested pile shall be used  to  install  all
  other  building  piles, and the equipment shall be operated identically.
  Also all other  piles  shall  be  of  the  same  type,  shape,  external
  dimension,  and  equal or greater cross section as the load-tested pile.
  All building piles within the area of influence represented by  a  given
  satisfactory  load-tested  pile  shall  bear  in, or on the same bearing
  stratum as the load-tested pile. For friction  piles  where  the  actual
  pile  lengths  vary more than fifty per cent from that of the test pile,
  the commissioner may require investigation to determine the adequacy  of
  the piles.
    (6)  PILE  GROUPS. When the commissioner has reasons to doubt the safe
  load sustaining capacity of pile groups, he or she may  require  at  the
  expense  of the owner, group load tests up to one hundred fifty per cent
  of the proposed group load.
    (7) "CASING-OFF." Any temporary  supporting  capacity  that  the  soil
  might  provide  to  the  pile  during  a  load  test, but which would be
  dissipated with time, shall be obviated  by  "casing-off"  or  by  other
  suitable  means.    For  purposes  of this section, temporary supporting
  capacity  shall  include  the  resistances  offered  by  any  strata  of
  nominally  unsatisfactory  bearing  materials  (class  11-65, other than
  controlled fill) or of soft or loose deposits of  class  9-65  or  10-65
  that are completely penetrated by the pile, or any resistance offered by
  granular soils that will be dissipated by reason of vibration.
    (e) Maximum loads.

    (1)  BASIC  MAXIMUM  LOADS.  Except  as permitted by the provisions of
  paragraph two of this subdivision,  the  maximum  allowable  pile  load,
  determined in accordance with the provisions of subdivisions (a) through
  (d)  of  this  section,  shall  not exceed the values specified in table
  11-6.
    (2)  SUBSTANTIATION  OF  HIGHER  ALLOWABLE  LOADS. The pile capacities
  tabulated in table 11-6 may be exceeded where  a  higher  value  can  be
  substantiated on the basis of test and analysis, as follows:
    a. Load tests. The provisions of subdivision (d) of this section shall
  be supplemented, as follows:
    1. Not less than one single-pile load test shall be conducted for each
  ten thousand square feet of pile foundation area.
    2.  Final load increment shall remain in place for a total of not less
  than ninety-six hours.
    3. Single test  piles  shall  be  subjected  to  cyclical  loading  or
  suitably instrumented so that the movements of the pile tip and butt may
  be   independently  determined.  Other  alternate  methods  or  devices,
  acceptable to the commissioner  which  will  permit  evaluation  of  the
  transfer of load from piles to soil may be used.
    4. Where the commissioner deems necessary, the provisions of paragraph
  six  of  subdivision  (d)  of  this section relating to group load tests
  shall apply. If required, group load tests shall be performed in  groups
  of  numerically  average  size.  Except where the proposed foundation is
  limited to single and/or two pile groups, each test group shall  contain
  not less than three piles.
    5. Individual pile loadings shall not exceed those determined from the
  single pile load tests.
    6.  The provisions of paragraph two of subdivision (d) of this section
  shall apply.
    b. Analysis and report. A report shall be submitted by  the  architect
  or engineer establishing to the satisfaction of the commissioner (on the
  basis of soil and load tests and foundation analysis, including analysis
  of the group action of the piles) that the proposed construction under a
  one  hundred per cent overload of the foundation is safe against failure
  of the pile and soil materials, and  showing  that  the  probable  total
  magnitude  and  distribution  of  settlement to be expected under design
  conditions will not result in instability of the building or stresses in
  the  structure  in  excess  of  the  allowable  values  established   in
  subchapter ten of this chapter.
    c.  Penetration  resistance.  The  penetration resistance shall not be
  less than that required by the provisions of  subdivision  (c)  of  this
  section  or, where applicable values are not indicated therein, shall be
  determined from the required load tests.  The  pile  material  shall  be
  capable of withstanding the driving stresses without being damaged.
    (f)  Combination  of  loads.  The  provisions  of  section  27-594  of
  subchapter ten of this chapter shall apply.
