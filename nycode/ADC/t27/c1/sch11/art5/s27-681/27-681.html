Section 27-681

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 27-681 Applicability. Soil load bearing tests made at the option and
  expense  of  the  owner  of  the  proposed  structure  and  inspected in
  accordance with the provisions of section 27-132  of  article  seven  of
  subchapter  one  of this chapter, controlled inspection, may be accepted
  by the commissioner as evidence of allowable bearing capacity of a given
  soil stratum, subject to the following limitations:
    (a) The applicability of soil load bearing tests shall be  limited  to
  soil materials of classes 5-65 through 10-65.
    (b)  Soil  load  bearing  tests shall not be used to justify allowable
  bearing pressures in excess of  the  maximum  allowable  bearing  values
  established in table 11-2 for the applicable class of material.
    (c) Soil load bearing tests shall not be applicable where the proposed
  bearing  stratum  is  underlain  by  a  stratum  of  lower class, unless
  analysis indicates that the presence of  such  lower  stratum  will  not
  create excessive settlements of the building.
