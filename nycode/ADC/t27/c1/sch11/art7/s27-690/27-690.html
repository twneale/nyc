<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 27-690 Use of existing piles at demolished structures. Piles left in
  place  where  a  structure has been demolished shall not be used for the
  support of new construction unless satisfactory evidence, including load
  or hammer testing of representative piles, can  be  produced  indicating
  the  capacity,  length,  and  driving  conditions of the piles. The load
  bearing value for such existing piles shall be the least of  the  values
  indicated  by: (1) the load or hammer test, (2) the capacity of the pile
  as a structural member, and (3) the allowable bearing  pressure  on  the
  soil  underlying the pile tips, all in accordance with the provisions of
  article eight of this subchapter.
