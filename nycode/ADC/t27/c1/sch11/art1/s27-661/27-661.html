Section 27-661

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-661  Construction. The provisions of subchapter nineteen of this
  chapter relating to  safety  and  of  subchapter  ten  of  this  chapter
  relating  to  concrete,  timber,  masonry,  and steel construction shall
  apply.  For  inspection  requirements,  see  article  thirteen  of  this
  subchapter.
    (a)  Cold  weather.  No  foundation shall be placed on frozen soil. No
  foundation shall be placed in freezing weather unless provision is  made
  to maintain the underlying soil free of frost.
    (b)  Seepage.  In an excavation where soil and ground water conditions
  are such that an inward or upward seepage  might  be  produced  in  soil
  material  intended to provide vertical or lateral support for foundation
  elements or for  adjacent  foundations,  excavating  methods  that  will
  control  or  prevent  the  inflow  of  ground water shall be employed to
  prevent disturbance of the soil material in the  excavation  or  beneath
  existing  buildings.  No  foundation shall be laid on soil that has been
  disturbed by  seepage  unless  remedial  measures,  as  directed  by  an
  architect or engineer, are taken.
