Section 27-659

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 27-659 Foundations at different levels. Where footings are supported
  at  different  levels,  or  at  different  levels  from  the footings of
  adjacent structures, the influence of the  pressures  under  the  higher
  footings  on  the  stability  of the lower footings shall be considered.
  Consideration shall be given to the requirements for lateral support  of
  the material supporting the higher footings, the additional load imposed
  on  the  lower  footings,  and  assessment of the effects of dragdown on
  adjacent pile-supported buildings.
