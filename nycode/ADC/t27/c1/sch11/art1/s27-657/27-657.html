Section 27-657

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-657  General  requirements.  Except  as  otherwise  specifically
  provided herein, the foundations of buildings including retaining  walls
  and  other structures shall bear on, or be carried down to, satisfactory
  bearing materials in such manner that the entire transmitted  load  will
  be  distributed  over  the  supporting  soils  at  any depth beneath the
  foundation at unit  intensities  within  the  allowable  bearing  values
  established  in  this  subchapter.  In  addition,  foundations  shall be
  proportioned to limit settlements to a magnitude  that  will  not  cause
  damage  to  the  proposed construction or to existing adjacent or nearby
  buildings during or after construction.
