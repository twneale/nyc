    &sect; 27-313 Projections above grade. Subject to the provisions of article
  eight  of  this subchapter the following projections may be constructed,
  above grade, to project beyond the street line:
    (a) Fixed Projections. Fixed projections  are  those  elements  listed
  below,  generally  of  an architectural character, that form an integral
  part of the building facade. The aggregate area of all fixed projections
  constructed to extend beyond the street line shall not exceed ten square
  feet within any one hundred square feet of  wall  area,  except  that  a
  veneer  may be applied to the entire facade of a building erected before
  December sixth, nineteen hundred sixty-eight, if such  veneer  does  not
  project  more  than  four inches beyond the street line. The area of any
  fixed projection shall be measured at that vertical plane,  parallel  to
  the wall, in which the area of the projection is greatest. This plane of
  measurement  may  be at the street line, the line of maximum projection,
  or any point in between.
    (1) ENTRANCE DETAILS. Entrance details,  including  steps,  and  doors
  when  fully  open,  may be constructed to project beyond the street line
  not more than eighteen inches Entrance steps  that  project  beyond  the
  street  line shall be guarded at each end by railings or check pieces at
  least three feet high  or  by  other  members  of  the  entrance  detail
  providing equivalent protection.
    (2)  ARCHITECTURAL  DETAILS.  Details  such as cornices, eaves, bases,
  sills, headers,  band  course,  opening  frames,  sun  control  devices,
  rustications, applied ornament or sculpture, grilles, windows when fully
  open,  air  conditioning  units,  and  other  similar  elements  may  be
  constructed to project not more than four inches beyond the street  line
  when less than ten feet above the ground or sidewalk level, and not more
  than ten inches beyond the street line when more than ten feet above the
  ground or sidewalk level.
    (3)  BALCONIES. Balconies, including railings and supporting brackets,
  no parts of which are less than ten feet above the  ground  or  sidewalk
  level,  may  be  constructed  to project not more than twenty-two inches
  beyond the street line. When permitted by the provisions  of  subchapter
  six  of  this chapter, fire escapes that are part of a required exit may
  be constructed to project not more than four feet six inches beyond  the
  street  line provided no part, including any movable ladder or stair, is
  lower than ten feet above the ground or sidewalk level when not in use.
    (4) MARQUEES. Marquees may be erected on public  buildings,  theaters,
  hotels,  terminals,  large department stores, supermarkets, multi-family
  dwellings, and similar buildings of an  essentially  public  nature,  or
  upon  a  warehouse or market in an established market area as designated
  by reference standard RS 4-3, so as to project beyond the  street  line,
  but not nearer than two feet to the curb line, provided that no parts of
  such marquees are less than ten feet above the ground or sidewalk level.
  Marquees  must  not  be  more  than  two  feet  to  curb lines hereafter
  established or changed. When measured from top to bottom, marquees shall
  not be thicker nor shall the fascia be  higher  than  three  feet.  This
  dimension  shall  include all decorations, but shall exclude any tension
  supports suspending  the  marquee  from  the  wall.  Marquees  shall  be
  supported   entirely   from   the   building   and   be  constructed  of
  noncombustible materials, except that the roof or any part of  the  roof
  may contain skylights complying with the requirements of subdivision (d)
  of  section  27-338  of article four of subchapter five of this chapter.
  Marquee roofs shall be drained in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of
  subchapter  sixteen  of  this  chapter.  When  the occupancy or use of a
  building with a marquee projecting beyond the street line is changed  to
  an occupancy or use for which a marquee is not permitted by this section
  the marquee shall be removed.

    (5)  LIGHT  FIXTURES.  Light fixtures that are supported entirely from
  the building may be constructed to project not more than two feet beyond
  the street line, provided no part of the fixture is less than eight feet
  above the ground or sidewalk level.
    (6) FLAGPOLES. Flagpoles that are supported entirely from the building
  may  be  constructed  to  project not more than eighteen feet beyond the

  part of the awning is less than eight feet above the ground or  sidewalk
  level,  except  for a flexible valance, which may be not less than seven
  feet above the ground or sidewalk level, and provided  that  the  awning
  box or cover does not project more than twelve inches.
    (2)  AWNINGS.  Awnings  over  windows  or  doors may be constructed to

  shall follow the requirements of section 27-336 of  subchapter  five  of
  this chapter.
    (d)  Bridges  Between  Buildings.  Bridges  connecting  buildings, and

  of incombustible material or  slow-burning  plastic  or  other  material
  which  will  not  support  combustion,  and  provided  the sides of such
  enclosures do not extend more than eight feet above the sidewalk.
    (2) Awnings supported entirely from the building may  be  placed  over
  sidewalk  cafes  provided  they  are at least eight feet clear above the
  sidewalk and provided they  are  within  the  limits  specified  by  the
  commissioner  of  consumer  affairs.  Such awnings shall be supported on
  metal  frames  and  constructed  of  canvas   treated   to   render   it
  fire-resistive or other material which will not support combustion.

    (3)  No  part  of  any  awning,  enclosure,  fixture or equipment of a
  sidewalk cafe shall be located beneath a fire-escape so as  to  obstruct
  operation  of  fire-escape drop ladders or counter-balanced stairs or to
  obstruct any exit from a building.
    (4)  a.  Removable  platforms  shall  be  constructed to provide for a
  continuous unbroken and level floor without openings or cracks so as  to
  prevent any material or liquid from falling through to the area beneath;
  no  papers,  trash  or other materials may be permitted to accumulate in
  the area beneath the floor of the platform.
    b. No part of the platform shall obstruct an exit from any building.
    c. No part of the platform shall cover a cellar entrance,  areaway  or
  other  vent,  except  that  an  easily  removable  section,  prominently
  designated, will be permitted if acceptable to the commissioner.
    d. No siamese connection or hydrant may be obstructed in any way  that
  would hinder its use by the fire department.
    (5) In addition to the requirements specified herein, the commissioner
  may promulgate such additional regulations necessary to secure safety.

  chapter or as required by the commissioner. The commissioner shall limit
  the length of any curb cut for  the  purpose  of  providing  a  driveway
  across  such  curb  or sidewalk, when in the opinion of the commissioner
  the actual use or intended use  of  such  driveway  would  endanger  the
  public.  The  owner  shall  maintain  every  part  of  such  driveway in
  accordance with the  specifications  prescribed  in  section  27-558  of
  article  three  of  subchapter nine of this chapter. Where the vehicular
  use of such driveway, in the opinion of the commissioner is dangerous to
  the public, the commissioner shall order the owner to discontinue use of

  department  of  transportation.  Upon the failure of the owner to comply
  with such  order,  the  commissioner  may  inform  the  commissioner  of
  transportation  of such failure to comply and request the cooperation of
  the commissioner of transportation acting under  his  or  her  authority
  pursuant  to  section  twenty-nine  hundred  four  of  the New York city
