    &sect;  27-316.1  Permit application contents. Applications for permits for
  construction  within  special  flood  hazard  areas,  as  delineated  in
  reference standard RS 4-4, shall contain the following information:
    (a) the elevation in relation to mean sea level of the proposed lowest
  floor (including basement or cellar);
    (b)  for non-residential structures, the elevation in relation to mean
  sea level to which such structure will be flood-proofed;
    (c)  a  certification  from  a  registered   architect   or   licensed
  professional  engineer  that  heating,  ventilation,  air  conditioning,
  plumbing, electrical and other services facilities within the  structure
  will  be  located or constructed so as to prevent water from entering or
  accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding;
    (d) for non-residential structures  intended  to  be  floodproofed,  a
  certification  from  a  registered  architect  or  licensed professional
  engineer that the flood-proofing design and methods of  construction  of
  such structure are in accordance with reference standard RS 4-5 and with
  accepted  standards  of practice to make such structure watertight, with
  walls substantially impermeable  to  the  passage  of  water,  and  with
  structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
  hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;
    (e)  for structures within Zone V, as delineated in reference standard
  RS  4-4,  a  certification  from  a  registered  architect  or  licensed
  professional  engineer  that  the  design and methods of construction of
  such structure are in accordance with reference standard RS 4-5 and with
  accepted  standards  of  practice  for  meeting  the   requirements   of
  subdivision (f) of section 27-317 of this code; and
    (f)  a  description,  where  applicable,  of  the  extent to which any
  watercourse will be altered or relocated as a  result  of  the  proposed
  work.
