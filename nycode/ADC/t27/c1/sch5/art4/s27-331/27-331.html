Section 27-331

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-331  Exterior  walls.  Exterior  walls  shall  comply  with  the
  fire-resistance rating requirements of table 3-4.  Where  provisions  of
  this  code  require a space or facility to be enclosed, the construction
  requirements for the enclosure shall not apply to any exterior wall that
  forms part of the enclosure.
    (a) Openings in exterior walls. In addition  to  the  requirements  of
  table  3-4  and  subchapters  six  and  eight  of this chapter, exterior
  openings above the third floor level of a building or above a height  of
  forty  feet,  except  buildings  in  occupancy  group  J-3, open parking
  structures, and buildings of construction classes II-D and  II-E,  shall
  have  opening  protectives when (1) any part of the opening is less than
  thirty feet distant in a direct unobstructed line not in the same plane,
  from an opening in another building or from a wood frame building or (2)
  any part of the opening is above and less than thirty feet in  a  direct
  unobstructed line from, any roof construction that has a fire-resistance
  rating  of  less  than one hour or that has unprotected openings therein
  within this distance, whether the  roof  construction  is  on  the  same
  building or on an adjacent building.
    (b)  Opening  protective  required  ratings.  In  a  building or space
  classified in occupancy  group  A,  all  opening  protectives  shall  be
  three-quarter   hour   (class   E)   opening   protectives  meeting  the
  requirements of reference standard RS 5-8.  Such  protectives  shall  be
  fixed  self-closing  or  automatic. Alternatively, these openings may be
  protected with three-quarter hour (class F)  protectives  together  with
  outside   sprinklers   installed   in   accordance   with   construction
  requirements of subchapter seventeen of this  chapter.  In  such  cases,
  there  shall  be an automatic dry pipe sprinkler head centered over each
  opening with the orifice  directed  against  the  opening.  All  opening
  protectives  required  by  table  3-4  or  by  subdivision  (a) above in
  buildings  classified  in  other  than  occupancy  group  A   shall   be
  three-quarter hour (class F) openings.
    (c)  First  story  openings. Opening protectives required by table 3-4
  may be omitted in show windows or other openings on the lowest story  of
  a building facing on a street or public space.
    (d) Nonautomatic protectives. Required opening protectives in exterior
  openings,  if not self-closing or automatic, shall be kept closed by the
  occupants at all times when not required for light or ventilation  under
  the provisions of subchapter twelve of this chapter.
    (e)  Construction of unprotected openings. Exterior windows and doors,
  including their frames and glazing, that are not required by  this  code
  to have a fire-protection rating, may be of combustible materials. Below
  a  height of seventy-five feet, slow-burning plastic glazing may be used
  in windows. Glazing in balcony doors shall comply with the  requirements
  of  paragraph  four of subdivision (g) of section 27-369 of article five
  of subchapter six of this chapter.
    (f) Vertical  separation  of  openings.  In  buildings  classified  in
  occupancy groups A, B, C, D and E, exceeding three stories or forty feet
  in  height,  openings  located  vertically above one another in exterior
  walls except in stairway enclosures, shall be separated  by  a  spandrel
  wall  at  least  three  feet high between the top of one opening and the
  bottom of the opening immediately above; or each such opening above  the
  lower one shall be protected against fire by an opening protective; or a
  fire canopy of noncombustible materials, extending out at least two feet
  horizontally  from  the  wall  and  at least as long as the width of the
  lower opening, shall be constructed between the two openings.  Spandrels
  and  fire  canopies  shall  be  constructed  to  provide  at  least  the
  fire-resistance rating required for the exterior wall, but in  no  event
  less than one hour.
