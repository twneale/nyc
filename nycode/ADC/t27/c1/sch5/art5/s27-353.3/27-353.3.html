    &sect;  27-353.3  Smoke barrier. A smoke barrier may or may not have a fire
  resistance rating. Smoke barriers may have openings that  are  protected
  by  automatic  closing  devices,  adequate  to inhibit movement of smoke
  through  the  opening.  The  smoke  barrier  may   be   constructed   of
  heat-strengthened or tempered glazing or the equivalent and protected by
  sprinkler  heads  constructed in accordance with subchapter seventeen of
  this chapter and installed a maximum of six feet (6'-0")  on  center  on
  each  side of the barrier. If the smoke barrier is constructed of glass,
  the portions of the smoke barrier located within two feet  of  the  door
  opening  and  within  five  feet  of  the  floor shall be constructed of
  tempered glass. Glass panels having an area in  excess  of  nine  square
  feet  with  the  bottom  edge  less than eighteen inches above the floor
  shall likewise be constructed of tempered glass. Portions of glass smoke
  barriers shall be marked where required in accordance with the rules  of
  the board of standards and appeals.
