Section 27-353.2

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-353.2  Smoke  protection  for elevators in E occupancies. For an
  elevator in a high rise building where such elevator serves four or more
  stories that contain space  classified  in  occupancy  Group  E  (office
  space),  inclusive of any lobby or entry level, such elevator shall meet
  the following requirements at every level served by  such  elevator  (i)
  for  such  buildings erected pursuant to new building applications filed
  on or after the effective date of this section, or  (ii)  where  two  or
  more new elevator shafts are installed in such buildings in existence on
  the effective date of this section:
    (a)  Elevator  vestibule  required.  At  every  floor  above  the main
  entrance floor where the fire command station is located, all  elevators
  shall  open  into an enclosed elevator vestibule. The elevator vestibule
  shall be  separated  from  the  building  occupancy  by  smoke  barriers
  extending from floor slab to floor slab.
    (b)   Permitted   penetrations.  Penetrations  in  addition  to  those
  permitted in section 27-353.3 (smoke barrier)  shall  be  provided  with
  smoke  dampers  as  defined in reference standard RS 13-1, except that a
  package pass through or communication opening not exceeding  one  square
  foot in area need not be provided with smoke dampers.
    (c)  Access  to  exits.  Access  to  an  exit on any floor through the
  enclosed elevator vestibule shall be permitted if the occupied areas  on
  that floor have access to at least one other required exit that does not
  require passing through the elevator vestibule.
    (d)  On  floors  with  a  floor  area of less than twenty-five hundred
  square feet, the  commissioner  may  accept  an  alternative  design  or
  construction  method that accomplishes the purposes of this section, or,
  if the commissioner determines that  compliance  with  this  section  is
  impracticable  in  whole  or  in part, the commissioner may authorize an
  exemption from the requirements of this section.
