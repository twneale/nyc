<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-339  Fire  segregation  of  occupancies. (a) Segregation by fire
  divisions. When different occupancies  are  to  be  segregated  by  fire
  divisions  under the provisions of section 27-240 of subchapter three of
  this chapter, the  occupancies  shall  be  separated  from  each  other,
  vertically  and  horizontally,  by  fire  divisions  having at least the
  fire-resistance ratings listed in table 5-2  for  the  occupancy  groups
  involved. Every building section shall be constructed of elements having
  at least the fire-resistance rating of a construction class required for
  the  area and height of the building section as listed in tables 4-1 and
  4-2.
    (b) Segregation by fire separations. When different spaces are  to  be
  segregated by fire separations under the provisions of section 27-240 of
  subchapter  three  of  this  chapter, the occupancies shall be separated
  from each other, vertically and horizontally, by fire separations having
  at least the fire-resistance ratings listed in table 5-1.  In  buildings
  of  construction  group  I,  fire  separations  shall  be constructed of
  noncombustible materials.
 
        (For Tables 5-1 and 5-2 see chapter 839 of the laws of 1986)
    Key: Fire-resistance ratings are given in hours. For Table  5-1,  read
  above  heavy  line.  For  Table  5-2, read below heavy line. NR means No
  requirement.
 
                        NOTES FOR TABLES 5-1 AND 5-2
    a. An office, or group of  offices,  whose  use  is  accessory  to  an
  occupancy, and totals four hundred square feet or less in area shall not
  be required to have a fire separation. Such office, or group of offices,
  totalling  more  than  four  hundred  square  feet  in area shall not be
  required to have a  fire  separation  if  such  offices  exit  directly,
  without having to pass through the area of the related occupancy.
    b. Counters  and  backbars for the sale of publications, tobacco prod-
  ucts, liquors, or candies, or for making of reservations for travel, car
  rental,  or  theatre,  or  otherwise  involving  similar  business   and
  mercantile activities that are accessory to an occupancy and are limited
  in  area  to  one hundred square feet, within the area of the occupancy,
  need not comply with the requirements of this table.
    c. The  provisions  of  this  table  shall  not   apply   to   closets
  seventy-five square feet or less in area.
    d. Nonresidential  kitchens  need not be separated by fire separations
  from adjoining dining spaces, provided:
    (1) The cooking equipment is vented directly to the outdoors, and
    (2) 2 draft curtain of noncombustible material, at  least  twenty-four
  inches  down  from  the  ceiling,  is  provided  to separate the cooking
  facilities from dining spaces, and
    (3) Sprinkler heads constructed in accordance with the  provisions  of
  subchapter  seventeen  of  this  chapter,  are  provided  on the cooking
  facilities side of the curtain, or any opening between the  kitchen  and
  dining  space,  located  within  twenty-four  inches  of  the curtain or
  opening, and spaced not more than forty-eight inches on centers  if  the
  opening  is  more  than  sixty  inches  wide.  When fire separations are
  provided double-action doors may be permitted.
    e. Kitchens having a floor area of  fifty-nine  square  feet  or  less
  located within dwelling units shall be separated from adjacent spaces by
  partitions  having  a fire-resistance rating of at least one hour except
  for the entrances thereto which need comply with section 27-342 of  this
  article. If doors are provided they may be of wood.

    f. In buildings or spaces classified in occupancy group J-1 or J-2 all
  partitions  in  dwelling  units  located in cellars shall have a minimum
  fire-resistance rating of one hour.
 
    (c)  Compartmentation. Notwithstanding the provisions of table 4-1, in
  existing office buildings one hundred feet  or  more  in  height  having
  air-conditioning  and/or  mechanical ventilation systems that serve more
  than the floor on which the equipment is  located,  unsprinklered  floor
  areas,  more  than  forty  feet above curb level, shall be subdivided by
  fire separations into spaces or compartments of  the  size  required  by
  paragraphs  one  through  five  of this subdivision. Floor area shall be
  defined as the area  within  exterior  walls  and  excluding  any  areas
  enclosing stairs, corridors, elevators and shafts:
    (1)  Unless  otherwise  provided  below, all unsprinklered floor areas
  shall  be  segregated  by  one-hour  fire  separations  into  spaces  or
  compartments not to exceed seventy-five hundred square feet.
    (2)  Where  the  floor area exceeds ten thousand square feet, at least
  one  of  the  subdividing  fire  separations  shall   be   of   two-hour
  fire-resistive  construction,  creating  areas of refuge, complying with
  section 27-372 of article five of subchapter six  of  this  code  except
  that the requirement for an elevator in each area shall not apply.
    (3) The floor area or any subdivided area may be increased to not more
  than  fifteen  thousand  square  feet  if  complete  area  protection by
  approved devices for the detection of products of combustion other  than
  heat is provided within such increased area and provided further than at
  least  one  of  the  subdividing  fire  separations shall be of two-hour
  fire-resistive  construction  where  the  floor  area  exceeds   fifteen
  thousand  square  feet,  creating areas of refuge in the same manner and
  under the same conditions as provided in two of  this  subdivision.  The
  activation  of any such detectors shall have the same effect as provided
  in subdivision (f) of section  27-972  of  article  five  of  subchapter
  seventeen of this code.
    (4)  In  existing  buildings,  existing  fire  separations of one-hour
  fire-resistive  construction  may  be  accepted  in  lieu  of  the  fire
  separation  of  two hour fire-resistive construction providing all other
  requirements of  paragraphs  two  and  three  of  this  subdivision  are
  complied with.
    (5)  Regardless  of  the  floor area, no subdivision of the floor area
  shall  be  required  under  this  subdivision  when  complete  sprinkler
  protection is provided in accordance with the construction provisions of
  subchapter seventeen of this chapter.
    (6) Existing office buildings one hundred feet or more in height shall
  comply with the requirements of this subdivision as follows:
    a.  Whenever  an  alteration is performed involving partition changes,
  compliance with this subdivision shall be required in  that  portion  of
  the building being altered.
    b.  At  least one-third of the total floor area of the building not in
  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  this  subdivision  on  February
  seventh,   nineteen   hundred  seventy-three,  shall  comply  with  such
  requirements  on  or  before  December  thirteenth,   nineteen   hundred
  eighty-one.  Complete plans showing such compliance for the phase of the
  work to be done shall be filed with, and  a  permit  secured  from,  the
  commissioner on or before September thirteenth, nineteen hundred eighty.
    c.  At least two-thirds of the total floor area of the building not in
  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  this  subdivision  on  February
  seventh,   nineteen   hundred  seventy-three,  shall  comply  with  such
  requirements on or before August seventh, nineteen hundred eighty-four.

    d. Full compliance shall be provided on or  before  February  seventh,
  nineteen hundred eighty-eight.
    (7)  In  existing  office buildings one hundred feet or more in height
  where compliance would cause practical difficulty or undue hardship, the
  commissioner may waive or modify  the  requirements  of  paragraphs  one
  through  five of this subdivision and accept alternatives fulfilling the
  intent  of  these  requirements.  Where   compliance   with   the   time
  requirements  of  paragraph  six  of  this subdivision would cause undue
  hardship, the commissioner, with the approval of the fire  commissioner,
  may  extend  the  time  for  compliance,  in  accordance  with rules and
  regulations to be  promulgated.  Before  such  application  for  a  time
  extension  shall  be considered all required applications and plans must
  be filed and approved, permits obtained and a good faith effort  towards
  completion of the work shall have been made.
