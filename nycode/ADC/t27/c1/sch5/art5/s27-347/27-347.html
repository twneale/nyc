  partitions that are required by this  code  to  have  a  fire-resistance
  rating.
    (a)  Construction  group  I.  In  buildings  of  construction group I,
  folding partitions may be used if they are constructed of noncombustible
  materials, or of fire retardant treated  wood,  or  are  constructed  of

  finish rating. Where partitions of combustible materials  are  permitted
  by  section  27-346  of  this  article,  folding  partitions may also be
  constructed  of  combustible  materials.  Where  doors  constructed   of

  combustible materials.
    (b)  Construction  group  II.  In  buildings of construction group II,
  folding partitions may be constructed of combustible materials, surfaced
  with interior finish  materials  meeting  the  requirements  of  section
  27-348 of this article.
