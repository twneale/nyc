Section 27-322

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-322  Tests.  Samples of all materials or assemblies of materials
  required by this code to have a fire-resistance rating,  fire-protection
  rating,  or  flame  spread  rating,  or  required  to be noncombustible,
  fire-retardant treated, or slow  burning,  shall  be  tested  under  the
  applicable  test  procedures  specified  herein,  in accordance with the
  acceptance requirements of section 27-131 of article seven of subchapter
  one of  this  chapter.  The  fire-resistance  rating  of  materials  and
  assemblies  listed in reference standard RS 5-1 may be used to determine
  conformance with the fire  resistance  requirements  of  this  code.  In
  addition  to  the  performance  results,  test  reports  shall  give all
  technical data pertaining to the nature of  the  constituent  materials,
  such  as  the  physical properties, chemical composition and properties,
  coefficient of expansion,  thicknesses  of  materials,  etc.  Except  as
  listed  in  reference  standard  RS  5-1, any assembly using a component
  having a structural base of  noncombustible  material  covered  with  an
  integrally   manufactured   combustible  surfacing  material,  shall  be
  approved for fire-resistance rating.
