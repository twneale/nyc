    &sect; 27-2113 Notice of pendency of action. a. In any action or proceeding
  brought  by  the  department,  it  may  file a notice of pendency in the
  county clerk's office in the county where the premises affected  by  the
  action or proceeding are located. The department may file such notice at
  any  time after it serves the notice of violation or order to repair, or
  at the  time  it  commences  the  action  or  proceeding,  or  any  time
  thereafter, before final judgment or order.
    b.  The  corporation counsel shall designate in writing on such notice
  of pendency the name of each person against whom the notice is filed and
  the number of each block on the land map of the county which is affected
  by the notice. The county clerk in whose office a notice of pendency  is
  filed  shall  record  and index such notice against the names and blocks
  designated.
    c. A notice of pendency may be vacated by order  of  a  judge  of  the
  court  where  such action or proceeding was brought or is pending, or by
  the written consent of the corporation counsel. The clerk of the  county
  where  such notice is filed shall cancel the notice upon receipt of such
  written consent or a certified copy of such order.
