    &sect;  27-2129  Statement of account. Whenever the department has incurred
  expenses for the repair of a dwelling or  for  the  elimination  of  any
  dangerous  or  unlawful  conditions therein, pursuant to this article or
  any other provision of the administrative code or any  other  applicable
  provision  of law, the department, its authorized representative, or the
  department of finance may send to the owner or his or  her  designee  in
  the  manner  provided  in  section  11-129  of the administrative code a
  statement of account with the expense incurred and a demand for  payment
  thereof.  If  the owner does not notify the department in writing of his
  or her objection to the  first  statement  of  account  containing  such
  charge  before  the  date  that  such  charge becomes due and payable as
  provided in subdivision b of section 27-2144 of article  eight  of  this
  subchapter,   such   owner   may  not  in  any  subsequent  judicial  or
  administrative  proceeding  contest  the  expense  contained   in   such
  statement.  The  department  will  only  review such objections that are
  received by it in writing on or prior to the due and  payable  date  for
  the  charge  provided on the second statement of account containing such
  charge.
