Section 27-2137

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-2137  Recovery of expenses of receivership; lien of receiver. a.
  The expenditures made by the receiver pursuant  to  section  27-2135  of
  this  article  shall, to the extent that they are not recovered from the
  rents and income of the property collected by the receiver, constitute a
  debt of the owner and a lien upon the building and  lot,  and  upon  the
  rents  and income thereof. Except as otherwise provided in this section,
  the provisions of article eight of  this  subchapter  shall  govern  the
  effect  and enforcement of such debt and lien; references therein to the
  department shall, for purposes of this article be deemed to refer to the
  receiver and, after such receiver's discharge, the department of housing
  preservation and development.
    b. Failure to serve a copy of the order and  notice  required  in  the
  manner specified by section 27-2131 of this article, or failure to serve
  any  mortgagee  or  lienor  with  a  copy  of the order to show cause as
  required by subdivision c of section 27-2132 of this article, shall  not
  affect  the validity of the proceeding or the appointment of a receiver,
  but the rights of the department of housing preservation and development
  or of the receiver shall not in such event be superior to the rights  of
  any mortgagee or lienor who has not been served as provided therein.
    c.  Any  mortgagee  or  lienor  who  at his or her expense remedies or
  removes the conditions to the satisfaction of the court pursuant to  the
  provisions  of  subdivision  c  of section 27-2134 of this article shall
  have and be entitled to enforce a lien equivalent to the lien granted to
  the receiver in favor of the  department  of  housing  preservation  and
  development  hereunder.  Any  mortgagee  or  lienor  who,  following the
  appointment of a receiver by the court, shall reimburse the receiver and
  the department of housing preservation and development for all costs and
  charges as hereinabove provided shall be entitled to  an  assignment  of
  the  lien  granted to the receiver in favor of the department of housing
  preservation and development.
