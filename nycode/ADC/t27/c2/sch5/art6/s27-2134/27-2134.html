Section 27-2134

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-2134  Proceedings  on  return  of order to show cause. a. On the
  return of the order to show  cause,  determination  thereof  shall  have
  precedence over every other business of the court unless the court shall
  find  that  some  other  pending  proceeding, having a similar statutory
  preference, has priority.
    b. If the court finds that the facts stated in the application warrant
  the granting thereof, then it shall appoint the commissioner of  housing
  preservation  and  development receiver of the rents, issues and profits
  of the property.
    c.  Notwithstanding  subdivision  b  of  this   section,   if,   after
  determination  of  the  issue,  the owner, or any mortgagee or lienor or
  other person having an interest in the  property,  shall  apply  to  the
  court  to  be  permitted to remove or remedy the conditions set forth in
  the department's application  and  shall  (1)  demonstrate  the  ability
  promptly  to  undertake the work required; and (2) post security for the
  performance thereof within the time,  and  in  the  amount  and  manner,
  deemed  necessary by the court, then the court may in lieu of appointing
  a receiver issue an order permitting such person  to  perform  the  work
  within  a time fixed by the court. If at the time fixed in the order the
  work has not been satisfactorily done,  the  court  shall  appoint  such
  receiver.  If  after  the  granting  of  an order permitting a person to
  perform the work but  before  the  time  fixed  by  the  court  for  the
  completion  thereof  it  shall  appear to the department that the person
  permitted to do the same is not proceeding with due diligence, then  the
  department  may  apply to the court, on notice to those persons who have
  appeared in the  proceeding,  for  a  hearing  to  determine  whether  a
  receiver shall be appointed immediately. On the failure of any person to
  complete  the  work  in accordance with the provisions of an order under
  this subdivision, the department, or any receiver  thereafter  appointed
  shall  be  reimbursed  for  costs  incurred by him or her in removing or
  remedying the condition and other charges herein provided for out of the
  security posted by such person.
