    &sect; 27-2136 Discharge of receiver. The receiver shall be discharged upon
  rendering  a  full and complete accounting to the court when the repairs
  and improvements herein authorized are completed and  the  cost  thereof
  and  all other costs authorized herein have been paid or reimbursed from
  the rents and income of the dwelling and the surplus money, if any,  has
  been  paid over to the owner or the mortgagee or lienor as the court may
  direct. However, at any time, the receiver may be discharged upon filing
  his or her account as  receiver  without  affecting  the  right  of  the
  department of housing preservation and development to its lien. Upon the
  completion  of the repairs and improvements, the owner, the mortgagee or
  any lienor may apply for the discharge of the receiver upon  payment  to
  the receiver of all moneys expended by him or her therefor and all other
  costs  authorized by section 27-2135 of this article which have not been
  paid or reimbursed from the rents and income of the dwelling.
