Section 27-2148

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-2148 Appointment of receiver. a. Whenever the sum of any lien or
  liens established by this chapter, plus any lien  or  liens  established
  pursuant  to  any  other  section  of  the  administrative  code for the
  expenses of repairs  made  by  the  department,  shall  amount  to  five
  thousand  dollars  or more, the department may issue an order appointing
  the  commissioner  of  the  department  of  housing   preservation   and
  development  receiver  of  the  rent  and  profits of the premises. Such
  receiver may be  appointed  upon  thirty  days'  notice  to  the  owner,
  mortgagees  and  lienors  of  record of such premises. Such notice shall
  contain the amounts of such lien or liens and give the owner, mortgagees
  and lienors of record an opportunity to either pay the outstanding liens
  or to contract in writing with the department on terms  satisfactory  to
  the  department  for  such payment. Any mortgagee or lienor who pays the
  department shall be assigned the department's lien.
    b. A receiver appointed pursuant to this section shall have all of the
  powers and duties of a receiver appointed in an action  to  foreclose  a
  mortgage  on  real property. Such receiver shall not be required to file
  any bond.
    c. The receiver shall be entitled to the same  fees,  commissions  and
  necessary  expenses as receivers in actions to foreclose mortgages. Such
  fees and commissions shall be paid into the  fund  created  pursuant  to
  section 27-2111 of article one of this subchapter. The receiver shall be
  liable  only  in  his  or her official capacity for injury to person and
  property by reason of conditions of the premises  in  a  case  where  an
  owner would have been liable; such receiver shall not have any liability
  in his or her personal capacity.
    d. Such receivership shall continue until the amount of such liens and
  the  commissions  have  been  fully  paid.  Upon the termination of such
  receivership, an accounting shall be given to the  owner  together  with
  any  moneys  collected  in  excess  of  the  lien and commission and the
  department shall, within twenty-one days, file a satisfaction of any and
  all liens filed by the department against such premises.
