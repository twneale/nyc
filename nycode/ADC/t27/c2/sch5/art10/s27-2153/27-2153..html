Section 27-2153.

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-2153.  Alternative  Enforcement  Program.  The  department shall
  establish an alternative enforcement  program  and  identify  distressed
  buildings  for  participation in such program. Notwithstanding any other
  provision of law, the department shall enforce violations of  this  code
  and the multiple dwelling law pursuant to such program, as follows:
    a.  The  department shall identify no fewer than two hundred different
  distressed buildings for participation in  the  alternative  enforcement
  program  in each of the first two years of such program. For purposes of
  this subdivision the criteria  used  to  identify  distressed  buildings
  shall be:
    (i)  twenty-seven  or  more  open  hazardous  or immediately hazardous
  violations of record which were issued  by  the  department  within  the
  two-year  period  prior  to  identification  of  the  building  for such
  program; and
    (ii) a ratio of open hazardous and  immediately  hazardous  violations
  which  were issued by the department within the two-year period prior to
  identification of the building  for  such  program  that  equal  in  the
  aggregate  five  or  more such violations for every dwelling unit in the
  multiple dwelling; and
    (iii) unpaid emergency repair charges, including liens, in a ratio  of
  one  hundred  or  more  dollars  for  each dwelling unit in the multiple
  dwelling which  were  incurred  within  the  two-year  period  prior  to
  identification of the building for such program.
    b.  In the third year of such program the department shall identify no
  fewer than two hundred different distressed buildings for  participation
  in  the  alternative  enforcement program. The criteria used to identify
  distressed buildings in such year shall be:
    (i) twenty-five  or  more  open  hazardous  or  immediately  hazardous
  violations  which  were  issued  by  the  department within the two-year
  period prior to identification of the building for such program; and
    (ii) a ratio of open hazardous and  immediately  hazardous  violations
  which  were issued by the department within the two-year period prior to
  such identification that equal  in  the  aggregate  five  or  more  such
  violations for every dwelling unit in the multiple dwelling; and
    (iii)  unpaid emergency repair charges, including liens, in a ratio of
  one hundred or more dollars for  each  dwelling  unit  in  the  multiple
  dwelling  which  were  incurred within the two-year period prior to such
  identification.
    c. (1) In the fourth year and each succeeding year of such program the
  department shall identify no fewer than two hundred different distressed
  buildings for participation in the alternative enforcement program.  The
  criteria used to identify distressed buildings in such years shall be:
    (i)  in  a multiple dwelling that contains not less than three and not
  more than nineteen units, a ratio  of  open  hazardous  and  immediately
  hazardous  violations  which  were  issued  by the department within the
  two-year  period  prior  to  such  identification  that  equals  in  the
  aggregate  five  or  more such violations for every dwelling unit in the
  multiple dwelling, and in a multiple dwelling  that  contains  not  less
  than  twenty  units, a ratio of open hazardous and immediately hazardous
  violations which were issued  by  the  department  within  the  two-year
  period  prior  to such identification that equals in the aggregate three
  or more  such  violations  for  every  dwelling  unit  in  the  multiple
  dwelling; and
    (ii)  paid and unpaid emergency repair charges, including liens, which
  were incurred within the two-year period prior to  such  identification,
  of two thousand five hundred or more dollars in a multiple dwelling that
  contains  not less than three and not more than nineteen units, and paid
  and  unpaid  emergency  repair  charges,  including  liens,  which  were

  incurred  within  the  two-year  period prior to such identification, of
  five thousand or more dollars  in  a  multiple  dwelling  that  contains
  twenty or more units.
    (2)   Notwithstanding   the   provisions  of  paragraph  one  of  this
  subdivision, in the sixth year of such program, and for each  succeeding
  year,  the department shall identify no fewer than two hundred different
  distressed buildings for participation in  the  alternative  enforcement
  program  and  may  by  rule revise criteria related to the ratio of open
  hazardous and immediately hazardous violations per dwelling unit and the
  amount or ratio per dwelling unit of paid and  unpaid  emergency  repair
  charges  which must exist for a building to qualify for participation in
  the program.
    d. For the purposes of subdivisions a and b  of  this  section,  those
  buildings  having  the  highest  aggregate  ratio  of open hazardous and
  immediately hazardous violations for every dwelling unit  shall  be  the
  buildings  identified  first  for  participation in the program. For the
  purposes of subdivision c of this section, those  buildings  having  the
  highest  amount  of  paid  and unpaid emergency repair charges and liens
  incurred within the two-year period prior to identification shall be the
  buildings identified first for participation in the program.
    e. Notwithstanding the criteria set forth in subdivisions a, b, and  c
  of  this  section, a building that is currently the subject of an in rem
  foreclosure action by the city, or that was the subject  of  an  in  rem
  foreclosure  judgment  in  favor of the city and that was transferred by
  the city to a third party pursuant  to  section  11-412.1  of  the  code
  within the prior five years, or that is currently the subject of a court
  order  appointing  or a proceeding brought by the department seeking the
  appointment of an administrator pursuant to  article  7-A  of  the  real
  property  actions  and  proceedings  law,  shall  not be included in the
  alternative enforcement program.
    f. Where there are fewer than two  hundred  buildings  that  meet  the
  applicable  criteria  only  the  buildings  meeting  such criteria shall
  participate in the alternative enforcement program.
    g. The department shall within thirty days of  identifying  distressed
  buildings  for  participation  in  the  alternative  enforcement program
  provide written notification to the owner of any building identified for
  participation in the alternative enforcement program, the  occupants  of
  such  building  and the council member in whose district the building is
  located, that such building is  subject  to  the  requirements  of  such
  program  and  the  requirements  of  this  article. The department shall
  simultaneously  provide  to  such  owner  information  about  correcting
  violations  related  to  mold  and  vermin,  when  such  violations  are
  applicable to such multiple dwelling, as set forth in paragraphs ii  and
  iii of subdivision i of this section.
    h.  The  department shall establish a process to provide the occupants
  of buildings participating in the alternative  enforcement  program  and
  council  members  within whose districts such buildings are located with
  information regarding the status of the building during participation in
  such program.
    i. (i) The owner of a building that is identified for participation in
  the alternative enforcement program shall  be  required  to  respond  in
  writing  to  the notification provided pursuant to subdivision g of this
  section whether he or she intends to correct the existing violations  of
  this  code  and  the  multiple dwelling law in such building. Such owner
  shall correct the existing violations of  this  code  and  the  multiple
  dwelling  law  in  such building no later than four months after written
  notification by  the  department  pursuant  to  subdivision  g  of  this
  section,  provided,  however,  that the original correction date for any

  violation issued in such building shall not be deemed to be  changed  or
  postponed  by  such  notification.  Nothing  in  this  subdivision shall
  preclude the department from determining after such identification  that
  the  provisions  of  subdivision k may be immediately implemented. Where
  such owner believes that such violations have been corrected, such owner
  shall request a reinspection of such violations  for  dismissal  by  the
  department.  The process to request a reinspection and dismissal of such
  violations shall be prescribed in rules promulgated by  the  department.
  The department shall perform a reinspection within sixty days of receipt
  of  a  request for such reinspection by the owner and upon completion of
  such reinspection the department shall assess  whether  such  owner  has
  substantially  complied  with  the requirements of this subdivision. The
  department shall issue a notice  of  violation  for  any  new  violation
  observed  in  the  course of such reinspection. After completion of such
  reinspection, the department shall within twenty days provide a  written
  determination  to  such  owner.  For  the  purposes of this subdivision,
  "substantial compliance" shall mean that at the time of reinspection  by
  the  department,  all violations relating directly to providing heat and
  hot water and all immediately  hazardous  violations  related  to  mold,
  eighty  percent  of  all  hazardous  violations  related to mold, eighty
  percent of all vermin violations and eighty percent of  all  other  open
  hazardous  and  immediately hazardous violations have been determined by
  the department to have been corrected.  A  violation  relating  to  mold
  shall  only  be  deemed corrected if the violation has been corrected in
  accordance with  paragraph  ii  of  this  subdivision  and  a  violation
  relating  to vermin shall only be deemed corrected if such violation has
  been corrected in accordance with paragraph iii of this subdivision.
    (ii) With  respect  to  mold  violations,  the  owner  of  a  building
  participating  in the alternative enforcement program shall correct such
  violations by investigating and correcting identified moisture  problems
  prior  to  or  as  part  of  the  mold  removal work; informing building
  occupants about commencement of mold removal  work;  providing  building
  occupants  with  a copy of the department of health and mental hygiene's
  brochure about mold and requiring, to the extent practicable,  occupants
  to  leave  the  work  area  before  work  begins;  removing, or securely
  covering with plastic sheeting, any difficult-to-clean surfaces or items
  in the immediate work area before mold  removal  work  begins;  ensuring
  that  all  mold  removal  work  is  done  in a manner that minimizes the
  dispersion of dust and debris from the work area into other parts of the
  dwelling; removing and throwing away porous materials that contain  mold
  growth  and that cannot be cleaned, or materials that are saturated with
  water and  that  cannot  be  dried;  discarding  any  plastic  sheeting,
  materials  with  mold  growth,  and used sponges, mop heads and cleaning
  wipe cloths in sealed heavy-duty plastic bags;  cleaning  any  remaining
  visible dust from the mold removal work using wet cleaning methods or by
  HEPA-vacuuming  and  cleaning  mold  growth  with  soap or detergent and
  water, not bleach or other biocide solutions.  When  such  mold  removal
  work  has  been  completed,  such  owner  shall  document all corrective
  actions taken for identifying and repairing moisture  sources  and  mold
  removal  work  methods  that were used, inform occupants of the building
  that if mold growth or moisture recurs they should inform  the  building
  owner,  and  shall  provide  a certification to the department that such
  actions have been taken.
    (iii) With respect to vermin  violations,  the  owner  of  a  building
  participating  in the alternative enforcement program shall correct such
  violations by eliminating conditions conducive  to  vermin  infestation,
  including  but  not limited to, areas allowing access to vermin, leaking
  plumbing, and uncontained garbage and debris, and eliminating sources of

  water and food for pests. Owners shall inform building  occupants  about
  the commencement of pest management treatment and provide occupants with
  a  copy  of  the  department  of health and mental hygiene's brochure on
  controlling  pests  safely.  Owners shall request that occupants support
  the pest management treatment by preparing  the  kitchen,  bathroom  and
  other  areas  as  needed  and  that  occupants be available to listen to
  advice on how to maintain pest-free conditions, including clean up, food
  storage, management of garbage, and  selection  of  safer  pest  control
  products.  Such  owner  shall  also address such violations by utilizing
  pesticide applications or devices as permitted by state and federal law.
  No person may perform pesticide applications unless  that  person  is  a
  certified  applicator  pursuant  to  article  33  of  the  environmental
  conservation law or is supervised by a certified  applicator.  An  owner
  shall  caulk  and  seal  small  holes less than four inches in diameter,
  cracks and crevices in or in between walls,  cabinets,  floors,  and  in
  other  locations  where  vermin  may gain access. A HEPA-vacuum shall be
  utilized in kitchens and bathrooms, including in  cracks,  crevices  and
  appliances  in  such  rooms.  When  such  pest  management work has been
  completed, such owner shall document all  corrective  actions  taken  to
  address  vermin  violations  including  work  methods and products used,
  provide information to occupants of the building about ways  to  control
  pests   safely,  inform  building  occupants  that  they  should  report
  recurrent or persistent pest  problems  to  the  owner,  and  provide  a
  certification  to  the  department that such actions have been taken. In
  addition, for  a  multiple  dwelling  in  which  vermin  infestation  is
  indicated  the  owner  of  such  multiple  dwelling  shall submit a pest
  management plan indicating  continuing  pest  control  measures  to  the
  department  of  health  and  mental  hygiene  for approval which must be
  approved by such department prior to the discharge of such building from
  the program.
    j. (i) Where an owner has received  a  written  determination  by  the
  department   that   he  or  she  has  substantially  complied  with  the
  requirements of subdivision i of this section, such owner shall  pay  to
  the  department  all outstanding charges, including liens, for emergency
  repair work performed by the department in such building that  are  due,
  if  any, or shall enter into an agreement with the department of finance
  to pay such charges and  liens,  and  shall  register  the  building  in
  accordance  with  article  two of subchapter four of chapter two of this
  title if the building is not validly registered. Upon such  payment,  or
  execution   of   such   an  agreement,  and  valid  registration,  where
  applicable, the department shall notify the owner, the occupants in such
  building and the council member  in  whose  district  such  building  is
  located  that the building has been discharged from participation in the
  alternative enforcement program, provided, however, that the  department
  shall  continue  to  monitor the building to ensure continued compliance
  with this code. Such monitoring shall be performed not less  often  than
  every  three  months  for  a  period  of  at least one year with special
  consideration given to any uncorrected immediately hazardous violations.
    (ii) Except as provided in subdivision l of this section, the  failure
  by an owner to substantially comply with the provisions of subdivision i
  of  this  section,  or pay all outstanding charges, including liens, for
  emergency repair work, if any, or  enter  into  an  agreement  with  the
  department of finance to pay such charges and liens, or validly register
  the  building  in  accordance  with  article  two  of subchapter four of
  chapter two of  this  title,  where  applicable,  shall  result  in  the
  building  remaining  in  the  alternative  enforcement program, and such
  building shall continue to be subject to the fees and other requirements
  applicable to such program. Upon  such  failure,  the  department  shall

  notify  such  owner  that  the building has not been discharged from the
  alternative enforcement program.
    k.  (i)  The  department shall perform a building-wide inspection of a
  building  that  is  subject  to  the  requirements  of  the  alternative
  enforcement  program  if:  (1)  the  owner  has  been notified that such
  building  has  not  been  discharged  from  the  program   pursuant   to
  subdivision i of this section, or (2) the owner has failed to respond to
  written  notification by the department in accordance with subdivision g
  of this section. Such building-wide inspection  shall  be  commenced  no
  later  than  thirty  days after notice is given to the owner pursuant to
  paragraph ii of subdivision j of this section. After such  building-wide
  inspection  is  completed,  the  department shall issue an order to such
  owner to correct existing violations  of  this  code  and  the  multiple
  dwelling  law  and  any new violations written since the notification of
  the owner in accordance with subdivision g of this  section  and  repair
  the  related  underlying conditions as shall be specified in such order,
  provided, however, that if such inspection does not  indicate  that  any
  building  systems must be repaired or replaced, the order may be limited
  to requiring the owner to  correct  violations  of  this  code  and  the
  multiple  dwelling  law  and  any  physical  defects. Such building-wide
  inspection shall be completed and such order issued within  ninety  days
  of  commencement  of  the  building-wide inspection. Such order shall be
  filed in the office of the county clerk  in  the  county  in  which  the
  building is located. For purposes of this article, a "related underlying
  condition"  shall mean a physical defect or failure of a building system
  that is causing or has caused a violation, such as, but not limited  to,
  a structural defect, or failure of a heating or plumbing system.
    (ii)  The  department  shall:  (1) within thirty days of the filing of
  such order prepare a scope of work necessary to correct  the  violations
  and  repair  the  related underlying conditions as are specified in such
  order; (2) cause repair work to be commenced and expeditiously completed
  unless there are circumstances beyond the control of the department such
  as:  the inability to obtain access to the building or any part  thereof
  necessary  for  the  making  of  such  repairs in which case the repairs
  related to the portion of the building to  which  access  could  not  be
  obtained  may  be  delayed until access is obtained; or the inability to
  obtain necessary legal  approvals,  materials  or  labor;  or  there  is
  ongoing  litigation with respect to the building that prevents such work
  from being performed by the department;  or  the  owner  undertakes  the
  repair  work  in  a  manner  that  is satisfactory to the department; or
  commencement or completion of the work  is  not  practicable  because  a
  vacate  or  similar  order has been issued by the department or any city
  agency and/or the cost of performing work necessary  for  restoring  the
  building  pursuant  to  the  order  is  economically infeasible; and (3)
  monitor repair work as it is performed in accordance with subdivision  m
  of  this  section.  For  the purposes of this subdivision, "economically
  infeasible" shall mean a determination by the department that  the  cost
  of  repairing a particular building exceeds the anticipated market value
  of such building after all repairs have  been  completed.  However,  any
  determination   by  the  department  that,  for  the  purposes  of  this
  subdivision, repairs to a  particular  building  would  be  economically
  infeasible  for  the  department  to  undertake,  shall  not  take  into
  consideration the owner's conduct with respect to the building.
    (iii) When the department  causes  repair  work  to  be  commenced  in
  accordance with paragraph ii of this subdivision, in a multiple dwelling
  in  which  vermin  infestation  is indicated, vermin violations shall be
  corrected in accordance with paragraph iii  of  subdivision  i  of  this
  section.  The  department  shall also require the owner of such multiple

  dwelling to submit to the department of health and  mental  hygiene  for
  their approval a pest management plan indicating continuing pest control
  measures.  Such  plan  must  be approved by the department of health and
  mental hygiene prior to the discharge of such building from the program.
    l. The owner or managing agent or other designated representative of a
  building  which is the subject of an order by the department pursuant to
  subdivision k of this section may be required to participate in a course
  of training relating to building operation and maintenance, approved  by
  the department.
    m.  The  department  shall  reassess,  at quarterly intervals, or more
  often  as  necessary,  each  building  that  has  been  identified   for
  participation  in  the  alternative  enforcement  program  for which the
  department has issued an order pursuant to subdivision k of this section
  and in which the department or an owner has commenced repairs, to ensure
  progress towards completion of such repairs. At each  such  reassessment
  the  department  shall  determine  whether  repairs are progressing in a
  timely fashion. When conducting such reassessment the  department  shall
  give  special  consideration  to the correction of immediately hazardous
  violations. No later than six  months  from  the  commencement  of  such
  repair  work,  if the department determines that such repair work is not
  progressing in a timely fashion, then the department shall expeditiously
  complete the repairs.
    n. The department  may  discharge  from  the  alternative  enforcement
  program  a  building  for  which  an  order  has been issued pursuant to
  subdivision k of this section  upon:  (1)  substantial  compliance,  (2)
  payment  of  fees,  (3)  payment  to  the  department of all outstanding
  emergency repair charges, including liens, or entry  into  an  agreement
  with  the  department  of finance to pay such charges and liens, and (4)
  registration  of  such  building  in  accordance  with  article  two  of
  subchapter  four  of chapter two of this title or such other criteria as
  may be established by rule which are not inconsistent with  any  of  the
  provisions  of  this  article as are applicable. The department may also
  discharge from the alternative  enforcement  program  any  building  for
  which  an administrator is appointed pursuant to article 7-A of the real
  property actions and proceedings law during the time  period  that  such
  building  is  participating  in the program; any building that is vacant
  for one year or more except for any building that contains six  or  more
  units  and  is  the subject of a vacate order; any building that becomes
  the subject of an in rem foreclosure judgment in favor of the  city  and
  that  is  transferred  by  the city to a third party pursuant to section
  11-412.1 of the code; and any  building  in  which  the  department  has
  completed  the  work it is required to perform pursuant to subdivision k
  of this section. Where the department determines to discharge a building
  from such program, it shall  provide  a  written  determination  to  the
  owner,  the  occupants  of such building and the council member in whose
  district such building is located and shall file in the  office  of  the
  county  clerk  in  the  county  in  which  such  building  is located, a
  rescission of the  order  issued  pursuant  to  subdivision  k  of  this
  section,  where  such  order  has  been issued. For the purposes of this
  subdivision, "substantial compliance" shall mean that  at  the  time  of
  reinspection  by  the  department,  all  violations relating directly to
  providing heat and hot water and all  immediately  hazardous  violations
  related  to  mold, eighty percent of all hazardous violations related to
  mold, eighty percent of all vermin violations and eighty percent of  all
  other  open  hazardous  and  immediately  hazardous  violations  and the
  related underlying conditions, have been determined by the department to
  have been corrected. A violation relating to mold shall only  be  deemed
  corrected  if  the  violation  has  been  corrected  in  accordance with

  paragraph ii of subdivision i of this section and a  violation  relating
  to  vermin  shall  only  be  deemed corrected if such violation has been
  corrected in accordance with paragraph iii  of  subdivision  i  of  this
  section  and,  when  applicable,  paragraph iii of subdivision k of this
  section.
    o. The department shall expeditiously undertake good faith efforts  to
  obtain  access  to any portion of the building where access is necessary
  in order to perform an inspection, perform work to correct  a  violation
  of  this  code  or the multiple dwelling law or perform work to repair a
  related underlying condition. If access is not obtained even after  such
  good  faith  efforts,  the  department  shall seek an order of access in
  accordance with the provisions of section 27-2123 of this code. Any time
  period set forth in this section within which the department is required
  to act shall be tolled during the period  in  which  the  department  is
  making  such  good faith efforts to obtain access or is seeking an order
  of access.
    p. An owner of a building who has been notified  of  participation  in
  the  alternative  enforcement  program pursuant to subdivision g of this
  section shall be subject to fees for any inspection, reinspection or any
  other action taken by the department in relation to such building during
  the time period that the building is in such program. A schedule of fees
  for this purpose  shall  be  prescribed  in  rules  promulgated  by  the
  department.
    q.  All  amounts  for  expenses  incurred  and  fees  imposed  by  the
  department pursuant to this article that  remain  unpaid  by  an  owner,
  shall  constitute  a debt recoverable from the owner and a lien upon the
  building and lot, and upon the  rents  and  other  income  thereof.  The
  provisions  of  article eight of this subchapter shall govern the effect
  and enforcement of such debt  and  lien.  The  department  may  serve  a
  statement  of account upon an owner for such amounts pursuant to section
  27-2129 of this subchapter.
    r. Any failure by the department to provide notification to  occupants
  of  a  building  that  is  participating  in the alternative enforcement
  program or council members as required by this article shall not prevent
  the department from taking any actions under or enforcing the provisions
  of this article, except that the department shall attempt to remedy  any
  such failure immediately upon its discovery.
    s.  On  or  before  February  15th  of each year, the department shall
  prepare and submit to the  council  a  report  on  the  results  of  the
  alternative  enforcement  program.  Such  report shall be cumulative and
  shall include the following: (i) the address and owner of each  building
  in  the  program; (ii) the council member in whose district the building
  is located; (iii) for  each  building,  the  aggregate  number  of  open
  hazardous   and   immediately  hazardous  violations  at  the  time  the
  alternative enforcement program was used as an enforcement mechanism for
  such building,  the  ratio  of  such  violations  and  unpaid  and  paid
  emergency  repair  charges  or liens, as is applicable, to the number of
  dwelling units at such time,  whether  or  not  the  building  has  been
  discharged from the program and the reason for such status; and (iv) the
  number  of  buildings  for  which  substantial  compliance  has not been
  achieved within twelve months from the start of their  participation  in
  the  program.  Such  report  shall be posted on the department's website
  within ten days of its submission to the council.
    t. Nothing in this section shall prevent the department from enforcing
  the provisions of this code or the multiple dwelling law pursuant to any
  other provision of this code, the multiple dwelling law or any other law
  where the department determines that additional  enforcement  mechanisms
  are  necessary  to  do  so.  Nothing  in this article shall be deemed to

  affect the duties of an owner, a tenant  or  the  department  under  any
  other article of this code or the multiple dwelling law.
    u.  Any  notifications  or  information required by this section to be
  provided to an owner or occupant of a building shall be in English,  the
  languages   set  forth  in  subdivision  j  of  section  8-1002  of  the
  administrative code of the city of New York and in such other  languages
  as the department deems appropriate.
    v.  No  later  than  July  31, 2012 and every two years thereafter the
  department shall conduct a study to evaluate the  effectiveness  of  the
  alternative enforcement program. Such study shall examine, but shall not
  be limited to examining, the following:
    (1)  the  program's  cost  effectiveness, including the amount of fees
  collected;
    (2) whether the criteria established pursuant to subdivisions a, b  or
  c  of  this  section  were  appropriate  and  if not, how they should be
  adjusted;
    (3) whether the monitoring undertaken by the department is appropriate
  and if not, what modifications should be made;
    (4) an evaluation of the use  of  the  work  practices  identified  in
  paragraph ii of subdivision i of this section to address mold conditions
  including the reoccurrence of mold;
    (5)  for  those multiple dwellings in which a building-wide inspection
  was conducted, an assessment of whether  mold  was  identified  in  such
  multiple  dwellings  and  whether  the  criteria  for  the issuance of a
  violation for mold should be revised or enhanced as a result;
    (6) an evaluation of the use  of  the  work  practices  identified  in
  paragraph  iii  of  subdivision  i  of  this  section  to address vermin
  conditions;
    (7)  information  on  the  compliance  levels  achieved  by   multiple
  dwellings which remain in the program for failure to achieve substantial
  compliance  and  recommendations  on  how  to  achieve higher compliance
  levels for those multiple dwellings; and
    (8) for  those  multiple  dwellings  that  were  discharged  from  the
  program,  information  on the number of such buildings that were able to
  correct all identified violations prior to discharge or that  were  able
  to  achieve  a  higher compliance level than required by this program in
  order to be discharged and an assessment of why such buildings were able
  to achieve such results.
    Such study shall  also  include  recommendations  as  to  whether  the
  program  should  be  continued  or  modified  in any way and the reasons
  therefore.
