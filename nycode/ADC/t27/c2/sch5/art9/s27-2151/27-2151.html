  maintain in a habitable condition all  single  room  occupancy  dwelling
  units  and  (2)  to  rent  such habitable single room occupancy dwelling
  units to bona fide tenants. The duty to rent shall be satisfied  by  the
  owner  if  the  owner  has  in  fact  rented all such units to bona fide
  tenants or has, in good faith, made a continuing public  offer  to  rent
  such units at rents no greater than the rent authorized by law.
    b.  The  provisions  of  this  section  shall apply to all single room
  occupancy multiple dwellings which are  subject  to  the  provisions  of
  subdivisons a and c of section 27-198.2 of the code during the time such
  subdivisions a and c are in full force and effect except:
    1.  any  single  room occupancy multiple dwelling which is exempted or
  for  which  an  application  for  exemption  from  the   provisions   of
  subdivisions  a  and  c  of  section 27-198.2 of the code has been filed
  pursuant to paragraphs one, two, or three of subdivision  d  of  section
  27-198.2;  provided,  however, that the provisions of this section shall
  apply to a single room occupancy multiple  dwelling  on  and  after  the
  sixtieth  day  after the date that an application for exemption pursuant
  to such paragraphs of such subdivision is denied.
    2. any single room occupancy dwelling unit with  respect  to  which  a
  payment  has  been made or a replacement unit has been provided pursuant
  to subparagraph a of paragraph four of subdivision d of section 27-198.2
  of this code.
    3.  any  single  room  occupancy  multiple  dwelling  for   which   an
  application  for reduction in payment or replacement units has been made
  pursuant to subparagraph (b) of  paragraph  four  of  subdivision  d  of
  section  27-198.2  has been made; provided, however, that an owner shall
  be  required  to  maintain  the  same  level  of   occupancy   in   such
  multiple-dwelling  which  existed on September twelfth, nineteen hundred
  eighty-six and provided, further, that the provisions  of  this  section
  shall  apply  to  such dwelling on and after the sixtieth day after such
