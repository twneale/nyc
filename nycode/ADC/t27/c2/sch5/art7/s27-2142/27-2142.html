Section 27-2142

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-2142  Reoccupancy after vacate order. a. No person shall occupy,
  or cause or permit to be occupied, any dwelling or  part  thereof  while
  such dwelling or part is subject to a vacate order.
    b. If the department finds that the conditions rendering a building or
  part  unfit  for  human  habitation have been corrected, it may revoke a
  vacate order. If the department finds that the unlawful  conditions  are
  being corrected and that continued occupancy may be permitted consistent
  with  health  and  safety,  it may extend the time period for compliance
  fixed in the order.
    c. The department may by regulations set forth standards  and  provide
  for  hearings  to  determine when such vacate order should be revoked or
  extended.
    d. The department may require as  a  condition  for  revocation  of  a
  vacate  order,  that  the  owner  make  reasonable  effort to notify any
  tenants who may have vacated the dwelling pursuant to  such  order  that
  said tenant has a right to re-occupy the dwelling.
