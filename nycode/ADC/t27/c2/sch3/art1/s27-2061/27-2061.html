Section 27-2061

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-2061  Lighting  and  ventilation  of  living  rooms  in  old law
  tenements.   a. Required windows.  Every  living  room  in  an  old  law
  tenement shall either have a window opening:
    (1) On a street; or
    (2) On a yard at least four feet in depth; or
    (3)  On  a  court or shaft at least twenty square feet in area open to
  the sky without a roof or skylight; or
    (4) Above the roof of an adjoining building;  or  it  shall  meet  the
  requirements  of  the  multiple dwelling law. In the event that a window
  opens above the roof of an adjoining building and the light and air from
  the adjoining lot is thereafter diminished in any  way,  the  department
  may  determine  that  such  a  room  is  a noncomplying room and require
  compliance with the requirements of the multiple  dwelling  law.  For  a
  room  located  on  the  top story, a ventilating skylight opening to the
  outer air may be substituted for a window. At least  one-half  of  every
  required window shall open.
    b. Dining space. A dining space shall have at least one window which:
    (1) Opens on a street, yard or legal court, and
    (2) Has an area not less than one-eighth the floor area of such dining
  space.
