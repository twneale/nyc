  have  a  total  area  of  at least three square feet and be at least ten

  skylight at least one foot wide with a  total  area  of  at  least  four
  square  feet  or one-eighth of the area of the kitchenette, whichever is
  greater, and which shall have ventilating openings of at least  one-half

  mechanical  ventilation  to provide at least six changes per hour of the
  air volume of such kitchenette.
    c. Every kitchenette may be equipped with a  door  or  doors,  if  the
  lower  portion  of each such door has a metal grille containing at least
  forty-eight square inches of clear  openings  or,  in  lieu  of  such  a
  grille,  there  are  two clear open spaces, each of at least twenty-four
  square inches, one between the bottom of the door and the floor, and the
  other between the top of the door and the head jamb.
    d. In every kitchen and kitchenette,  constructed  on  or  after  July
  fourteenth,  nineteen  hundred  sixty-seven,  all  combustible  material
  immediately underneath or within one foot  of  any  permanent  apparatus
  used  for cooking or warming food shall be fire-retarded or covered with
  asbestos  at  least  three-sixteenths  of  an  inch  in  thickness   and
  twenty-six  gauge  metal  or  with fire-resistive material of equivalent
  rating, except where such permanent  cooking  or  warming  apparatus  is
  installed  in accordance with requirements established by the department
  in conformity with generally  accepted  safety  standards.  There  shall
  always  be  at  least  two feet of clear space above any exposed cooking
  surfaces of such apparatus.

  fourteenth,  nineteen  hundred sixty-seven, fire-retard the ceilings and
  walls, exclusive of doors.
