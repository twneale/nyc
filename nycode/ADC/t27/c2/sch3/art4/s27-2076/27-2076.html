Section 27-2076

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-2076 Prohibited occupancies. a. No kitchen shall be occupied for
  sleeping purposes.
    b. No rooming unit shall be occupied by a family with  a  child  under
  the  age  of  sixteen  years, except that if a child is born to a family
  residing in  such  accommodations,  the  unlawful  occupancy  shall  not
  commence until one year after the birth of such child. In any case where
  such an unlawful occupancy continues for ten days after the service of a
  notice  of violation upon both the tenant and owner, the department may,
  in addition to  all  other  remedies,  institute  a  proceeding  for  an
  injunction  pursuant  to article four of subchapter five of this chapter
  to obtain an order requiring that such violation be remedied by eviction
  or removal of the tenant. The provisions of this subdivision  shall  not
  prohibit  such occupancy (1) in rooming units operated without profit by
  an  educational,  religious  or  charitable  institution  of  the   type
  described  and  for  the  purposes set forth in subdivision a of section
  27-2077 of this article, or (2) in a summer resort dwelling.
