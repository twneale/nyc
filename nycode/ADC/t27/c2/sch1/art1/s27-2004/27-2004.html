Section 27-2004

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-2004  Definitions.  a.  The  following  terms,  as  used in this
  chapter, shall have the following meanings:
    1. The term department shall mean the department, bureau, division  or
  other agency charged with the enforcement of this title.
    2.  Wherever the word or words occupied, is occupied, used, or is used
  appear, such word or words shall be construed  as  if  followed  by  the
  words "or is intended, arranged or designed to be used or occupied".
    3. A dwelling is any building or structure or portion thereof which is
  occupied in whole or in part as the home, residence or sleeping place of
  one or more human beings.
    4. A family is
    (a) A single person occupying a dwelling unit and maintaining a common
  household with not more than two boarders, roomers or lodgers; or
    (b)   Two   or   more   persons  related  by  blood,  adoption,  legal
  guardianship, marriage or domestic  partnership;  occupying  a  dwelling
  unit and maintaining a common household with not more than two boarders,
  roomers or lodgers; or
    (c)  Not  more  than three unrelated persons occupying a dwelling unit
  and maintaining a common household; or
    (d) Not more than three unrelated persons occupying a dwelling unit in
  a congregate housing or shared  living  arrangement  and  maintaining  a
  common household; or
    (e) Members of a group home; or
    (f)  Foster  children  placed in accordance with provisions of the New
  York state social services law, their foster parents, and other  persons
  related   to   the   foster  parents  by  blood,  marriage  or  domestic
  partnership; where all residents occupy and maintain a common  household
  with not more than two boarders, roomers or lodgers; or
    (g)  Up  to  seven  unrelated students enrolled at a single accredited
  college or university occupying a student apartment,  as  such  term  is
  defined  in  the  New  York city building code, and maintaining a common
  household pursuant to a lease, sublease, or occupancy agreement directly
  with such college or university, provided that:
    (i) The entire structure in which the  dwelling  unit  is  located  is
  fully  sprinklered  in  accordance  with  chapter 9 of the New York city
  building code; and
    (ii)  Such  occupancy  does  not  exceed  the  maximums  contained  in
  subdivision a of section 27-2075; and
    (iii)  Prior to commencement of such occupancy, and on an annual basis
  thereafter such college or university has submitted a fire  safety  plan
  containing  fire safety and evacuation procedures for such dwelling unit
  that is acceptable to the fire commissioner and in compliance  with  any
  rules promulgated by the fire commissioner; and
    (iv)   The  dwelling  unit  complies  with  additional  occupancy  and
  construction  requirements  as  may  be  established  by  rule  by   the
  department of housing preservation and development or its successor.
    A  common  household  is deemed to exist if every member of the family
  has access to all parts of the dwelling unit.  Lack  of  access  to  all
  parts  of the dwelling unit establishes a rebuttable presumption that no
  common household exists.
    5. "Person," for the purposes of article four of subchapter  three  of
  this  chapter,  means any adult or child over the age of four years. The
  term "person" as used in subchapters four and five of  this  code  shall
  include the owner, mortgagee or vendee in possession, assignee of rents,
  receiver,  executor, trustee, lessee, agent or any other person, firm or
  corporation directly or indirectly in control  of  a  dwelling  or  part
  thereof.  Whenever a multiple dwelling shall have been declared a public
  nuisance to any extent pursuant to section 27-2114  of  article  one  of

  subchapter  five  of  this  chapter and such declaration shall have been
  filed as therein provided, the term "person" shall be deemed to include,
  in addition to those mentioned hereinabove, all the officers,  directors
  and  persons  having  an interest in more than ten percent of the issued
  and outstanding stock of the owner  as  herein  defined,  as  holder  or
  beneficial  owner  thereof, if such person be a corporation other than a
  banking organization as defined in section two of  the  banking  law,  a
  national  banking  association,  a federal savings and loan association,
  the mortgage facilities corporation, savings banks life insurance  fund,
  the savings banks retirement system, an authorized insurer as defined in
  section  one  hundred  seven of the insurance law, or a trust company or
  other corporation organized under the laws of this state all the capital
  stock of which is owned by at least twenty savings banks or by at  least
  twenty  savings and loan associations or a subsidiary corporation all of
  the capital stock of which is owned  by  such  trust  company  or  other
  corporation.
    6.  A  private  dwelling  is  any  building  or structure designed and
  occupied for residential purposes by not more than two families. Private
  dwellings shall also be deemed to include  a  series  of  one-family  or
  two-family  dwelling  units  each  of  which faces or is accessible to a
  legal street or public thoroughfare,  if  each  such  dwelling  unit  is
  equipped as a separate dwelling unit with all essential services, and if
  each  such  unit  is  arranged  so  that  it  may be approved as a legal
  one-family or two-family dwelling.
    7. A multiple dwelling is a dwelling which is either  rented,  leased,
  let  or  hired  out, to be occupied, or is occupied, as the residence or
  home of three or more families living independently  of  each  other.  A
  multiple dwelling shall also include residential quarters for members or
  personnel  of  any  hospital staff which are not located in any building
  used primarily for hospital use, but any  building  which  was  erected,
  altered  or  converted prior to July first, nineteen hundred fifty-five,
  to be occupied by such members or personnel or is so  occupied  on  such
  date  shall not be subject to the requirements of this code only so long
  as it continues to be so occupied if there are local laws applicable  to
  such building and such building is in compliance with such local laws. A
  multiple  dwelling  does not include (i) a hospital, convent, monastery,
  asylum or public institution; or (ii) a fireproof building  used  wholly
  for commercial purposes except for not more than one janitor's apartment
  and  not more than one penthouse occupied by not more than two families.
  For the purposes of this chapter, multiple dwellings  are  divided  into
  two classes: "class A" and "class B."
    8.    (a)  A  class A multiple dwelling is a multiple dwelling that is
  occupied for permanent residence  purposes.  This  class  shall  include
  tenements,   flat   houses,  maisonette  apartments,  apartment  houses,
  apartment  hotels,  bachelor  apartments,  studio   apartments,   duplex
  apartments,  kitchenette  apartments,  garden-type  maisonette  dwelling
  projects, and all other  multiple  dwellings  except  class  B  multiple
  dwellings.  A class A multiple dwelling shall only be used for permanent
  residence purposes. For the purposes of  this  subparagraph,  "permanent
  residence purposes" shall consist of occupancy of a dwelling unit by the
  same natural person or family for thirty consecutive days or more, and a
  natural  person or family so occupying a dwelling unit shall be referred
  to herein  as  the  permanent  occupants  of  such  dwelling  unit.  The
  following  uses  of  a  dwelling unit by the permanent occupants thereof
  shall not be deemed to be inconsistent with occupancy of  such  dwelling
  unit for permanent residence purposes:
    (1)  (A)  occupancy  of  such  dwelling  unit  for  fewer  than thirty
  consecutive days by other natural persons living within the household of

  the permanent occupant such as house guests or lawful boarders,  roomers
  or lodgers; or
    (B)  incidental  and  occasional  occupancy  of such dwelling unit for
  fewer than thirty consecutive days by other  natural  persons  when  the
  permanent  occupants are temporarily absent for personal reasons such as
  vacation or medical  treatment,  provided  that  there  is  no  monetary
  compensation paid to the permanent occupants for such occupancy.
    (2)   In   a   class  A  multiple  dwelling  owned  by  an  accredited
  not-for-profit college or university or leased  by  such  a  college  or
  university under a net lease for a term of forty-nine years or more, the
  use  of  designated  dwelling  units for occupancy for fewer than thirty
  consecutive days shall not be inconsistent with the  occupancy  of  such
  multiple dwelling for permanent residence purposes if:
    (A)  No  more than five percent of the dwelling units in such multiple
  dwelling but not less than one dwelling unit, are  designated  for  such
  use  and  the  designation  of  a  unit  once made may not be changed to
  another unit;
    (B) A list of the designated dwelling units certified by an authorized
  representative of the college or university is kept on the  premises  by
  the  owner  or net lessee and made available upon request for inspection
  by the department or the fire department of such city;
    (C) Only designated dwelling units on the certified list are used  for
  occupancy for fewer than thirty consecutive days and only by (i) natural
  persons,  other than persons whose only relationship with the college or
  university is as a student, for  whom  the  college  or  university  has
  undertaken to provide housing accommodations such as visiting professors
  and  academics, graduate students with research or teaching fellowships,
  researchers and persons presenting  academic  papers,  interviewing  for
  positions  of  employment  or  having  other  similar  business with the
  college or university, or (ii)  natural  persons  for  whom  a  hospital
  affiliated  with  such  college  or university has undertaken to provide
  housing accommodations  such  as  patients,  patients'  families  and/or
  accompanying  escorts,  medical professionals and healthcare consultants
  or persons having other similar business with such hospital. A log shall
  be maintained on the premises of the names and addresses of such persons
  and the duration and reason for their stay. Such log shall be accessible
  upon request for inspection by the department and the fire department of
  such municipality;
    (D) No rent or other payment is collected for such occupancy; and
    (E) The fire department of such city shall require  the  filing  of  a
  fire safety plan or other appropriate fire safety procedure.
    (b) A garden-type maisonette dwelling project is a series of attached,
  detached  or  semi-detached dwelling units which are provided as a group
  collectively with all essential services such as, but  not  limited  to,
  water  supply and house sewers, and which units are located on a site or
  plot not less than twenty thousand square  feet  in  area  under  common
  ownership  and erected under plans filed with the department on or after
  April eighteenth, nineteen hundred fifty-four, and which units  together
  and in their aggregate are arranged or designed to provide three or more
  apartments.
    9.  A  class  B  multiple  dwelling  is  a  multiple dwelling which is

  and one family on each floor in a  three  story  building.  A  converted

  not  have  both lawful sanitary facilities and lawful cooking facilities
  for the exclusive use of the family residing in such  unit.  It  may  be
  located  either  within  an  apartment  or within any class A or class B
  multiple dwelling. A rooming unit shall not include a living room  in  a
