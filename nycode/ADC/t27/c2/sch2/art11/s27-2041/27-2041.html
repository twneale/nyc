    &sect;  27-2041  Peepholes.  In  every dwelling the owner shall provide and
  maintain a peephole in the entrance door of  each  dwelling  unit.  Such
  peephole  shall  be  located, as prescribed by the department, in such a
  place that the person in each dwelling unit may view from the inside any
  person immediately outside the entrance  door.  However,  such  peephole
  need  not  be  installed  in any tenant-occupied one- or two-family home
  where it is possible to see  from  the  inside  any  person  immediately
  outside  the  entrance  door.  This  section  shall not apply to hotels,
  apartment hotels,  college  or  school  dormitories,  or  owner-occupied
  dwelling units in one- and two-family homes.
