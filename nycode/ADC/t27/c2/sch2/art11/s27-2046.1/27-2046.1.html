    &sect;  27-2046.1 Duties of owner and occupant with respect to installation
  and maintenance of carbon monoxide detecting devices in class A multiple
  dwellings and private dwellings. a. As used in  paragraphs  two  through
  six  of subdivision b of this section, the term "private dwelling" shall
  mean a dwelling unit  in  a  one-family  or  two-family  home  which  is
  occupied by a person or persons other than the owner of such unit or the
  owner's family.
    b.    It shall be the duty of the owner of a class A multiple dwelling
  and a private dwelling which is required to be equipped with one or more
  carbon monoxide detecting devices pursuant to section 908.7 of  the  New
  York  city  building code or sections 27-981.1, 27-981.2 and 27-981.3 of
  the 1968 building code to:
    (1) provide and install one or more approved  and  operational  carbon
  monoxide  detecting  devices  in  each  dwelling  unit  and replace such
  devices as necessary in accordance with article 12 of chapter 3 of title
  28 of the administrative code;
    (2) post a notice in a form approved by the commissioner in  a  common
  area of a Class A multiple dwelling and otherwise provide such notice to
  the  occupants  of  a  private  dwelling informing the occupants of such
  dwelling that the owner is required  by  law  to  install  one  or  more
  approved  and  operational  carbon  monoxide  detecting  devices in each
  dwelling unit in the dwelling and to periodically replace  such  devices
  upon  the  expiration  of  their useful life, provided that an owner may
  choose to post or otherwise provide a single notice that  complies  with
  this provision as well as the provisions of paragraph two of subdivision
  a of section 27-2045 of this article;
    (3)  replace  any  carbon  monoxide  detecting  device  which has been
  stolen, removed, found missing or rendered  inoperable  during  a  prior
  occupancy  of  the  dwelling unit and which has not been replaced by the
  prior occupant prior to  the  commencement  of  a  new  occupancy  of  a
  dwelling unit;
    (4)  replace  within thirty calendar days after the receipt of written
  notice any such device which becomes inoperable within one year  of  the
  installation  of  such device due to a defect in the manufacture of such
  device and through no fault of the occupant of the dwelling unit;
    (5) provide written information regarding the testing and  maintenance
  of  carbon  monoxide detecting devices to at least one adult occupant of
  each dwelling unit including, but not limited  to,  general  information
  concerning carbon monoxide poisoning and what to do if a carbon monoxide
  detecting device goes off; the useful life of the device and the owner's
  duty to replace such device pursuant to article 12 of chapter 3 of title
  28  of  the  administrative  code. Such information may include material
  that is distributed  by  the  manufacturer,  material  prepared  by  the
  department  of  buildings  or  material  approved  by  the department of
  buildings; and
    (6) keep such records as the commissioner shall prescribe relating  to
  the installation and maintenance of carbon monoxide detecting devices in
  the  building,  including  the  manufacturers  suggested  useful life of
  devices, and make  such  records  available  to  the  commissioner  upon
  request.
    c.  Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision a of section 27-2005
  and  subdivision  c  of section 27-2006 of this chapter, it shall be the
  sole duty of the occupant of each dwelling unit in a  class  A  multiple
  dwelling  and  the  occupant of a dwelling unit in a private dwelling in
  which a carbon monoxide detecting device has been provided and installed
  by the owner pursuant to the provisions of section 908.7 of the New York
  city building code, sections 27-981.1, 27-981.2 and 27-981.3 of the 1968

  building  code  or  article  12  of  chapter  3  of  title  28  of   the
  administrative code to:
    (1) keep and maintain such device in good repair; and
    (2)  replace  any  device  which is either stolen, removed, missing or
  rendered inoperable during the occupancy of such dwelling unit.
    d. Except as otherwise  provided  in  paragraphs  three  and  four  of
  subdivision  a  of this section, an owner of a dwelling who has provided
  and installed a carbon monoxide detecting  device  in  a  dwelling  unit
  pursuant to this section shall not be required to keep and maintain such
  device  in  good  repair  or to replace any such device which is stolen,
  removed, missing or rendered inoperable during  the  occupancy  of  such
  dwelling unit.
    e.  It  shall  be  unlawful  for  any  person to tamper with or render
  inoperable a carbon monoxide detecting device  that  is  required  under
  article  seven  of  subchapter  seventeen  of chapter one of this title,
  except for replacing the batteries or for other maintenance purposes.
    f. The occupant  of  a  dwelling  unit  in  which  a  carbon  monoxide
  detecting  device  is  newly  installed or installed to replace a device
  that has exceeded the manufacturers suggested useful life or as a result
  of such occupant's failure to maintain such device or where such  device
  has  been lost or damaged by such occupant, shall reimburse the owner in
  the amount of twenty-five dollars  for  the  cost  of  such  work.  Such
  occupant  shall have one year from the date of installation to make such
  reimbursement.
