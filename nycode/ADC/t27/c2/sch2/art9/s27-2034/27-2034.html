Section 27-2034

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-2034  Space  and water heaters. a. Any gas-fueled space or water
  heater used in any dwelling unit,  in  addition  to  the  provisions  of
  section  27-2032  of article eight of this subchapter, shall comply with
  the  provisions  of  this  section  and  with  the  regulations  of  the
  department.
    b.  No  person  shall  install  or maintain in any dwelling unit a gas
  fuel-fired space or water heater unless the  heater  obtains  combustion
  air directly from the outside of the building. In the alternative, a gas
  fuel-fired water heater that does not obtain its combustion air directly
  from  the  outside  of the building may be installed, provided that such
  installation is in compliance with the conditions of  subdivision  i  of
  section P107.26 of reference standard RS-16 of the building code.
    c.  No person shall install or maintain a gas-fueled water heater in a
  room occupied for sleeping purposes, or cause or permit to  be  occupied
  for  sleeping  purposes  any  room  in  which  a  gas-fueled  heater  is
  installed.
    d. No person  shall  install  or  maintain  in  any  dwelling  unit  a
  gas-fueled  water heater so designed and arranged that it heats water in
  pipe coils placed at a distance from the hot water storage tank.
    e. Every gas fuel-fired space or water heater shall be  (i)  currently
  listed  by  an  independent laboratory acceptable to the commissioner of
  buildings, (ii) approved  by  the  department  of  buildings  and  (iii)
  approved   by  the  department  of  health  and  mental  hygiene.    All
  accessories or control devices for use  with  such  heaters  shall  have
  proof of such listing.
    f.  Each  heater shall be equipped with an effective device which will
  automatically shut off the gas supply to the heater if its  pilot  light
  or other constantly burning flame is extinguished, or in the event of an
  interruption  of  the  gas supply to the heater, and will not permit the
  heater to be relighted  unless  such  shut-off  device  is  first  reset
  manually.
    g.  Each heater shall be rigidly connected to the gas piping supplying
  gas in the premises.
    h. Each heater shall be connected to a flue or outlet pipe  conforming
  to  the provisions of the building code. No heater shall be vented to an
  inner court. A flue or outlet pipe may be extended to an inner court  if
  the  flue  or  pipe  is connected with an outside chimney which conforms
  with the provisions of the building code.
