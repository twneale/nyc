Section 27-2038

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-2038 Electric lighting fixtures required in certain public parts
  of dwellings. a. Subject to any stricter  minimum  lighting  requirement
  that  may  be applicable pursuant to the multiple dwelling law, in every
  multiple dwelling and tenant-occupied  two-family  dwelling  light  from
  electric  lighting  fixtures and daylight shall in the aggregate provide
  an illumination level of no less than one foot-candle, measured  at  the
  floor  level,  throughout  all public hallways, stairs, fire stairs, and
  fire towers at all times of the day  and  night  and  throughout  common
  laundry rooms at all times that such rooms are occupied. The owner shall
  install,  position,  operate  and  maintain sufficient electric lighting
  fixtures to assure that the required illumination level is maintained.
    b. The owner of a  multiple  dwelling  shall  keep  electric  lighting
  fixtures  on  continuously, during the day as well as at night, in every
  fire stair and fire tower and in every stairway and public hall with  no
  window  opening on a street, court, yard, space above a setback or shaft
  supplying sufficient illumination to maintain the required  illumination
  level during the daylight hours.
    c.  Photosensor  lighting  controls  may  be  used to control electric
  lighting fixtures in public halls and stairs according to the amount  of
  daylight  available  provided that the level of illumination required by
  subdivision a of this section is maintained at all times and the  switch
  controllers  are  equipped  for fail-safe operation ensuring that if the
  sensor or control fails, the lighting  levels  will  be  at  the  levels
  required by subdivision a of this section.
    d.  Automatic, occupant sensor or photosensor lighting controls may be
  used to operate lighting fixtures in common laundry rooms, provided that
  all of the following conditions are satisfied:
    1.  the  switch  controllers  are  equipped  for  fail-safe  operation
  ensuring  that  if the sensor or control fails, the lighting levels will
  be at the levels required by subdivision a of this section;
    2. for occupant sensors, the illumination times are set for a  maximum
  thirty minute duration; and
    3.  for  occupant  sensors,  the  sensor  is activated by any occupant
  movement in the area served by the lighting fixtures.
    e. For the purposes of this section the  term  "photosensor"  means  a
  device that detects the presence of visible light and the term "occupant
  sensor"  means  a  device that detects the presence or absence of people
  within an area and causes lighting to be regulated accordingly.
