<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-2040  Lights  near  entrance  ways  and  in  yards and courts of
  multiple dwellings. a. The owner of a multiple  dwelling  shall  install
  and  maintain  one  or  more  lights at or near the outside of the front
  entrance way of the building which shall in the  aggregate  provide  not
  less  than one hundred watts incandescent illumination or its equivalent
  for a building with a frontage up to twenty-two feet,  and  two  hundred
  watts  incandescent illumination or its equivalent for a building with a
  frontage in excess of  twenty-two  feet.  In  the  case  of  a  multiple
  dwelling with a frontage in excess of twenty-two feet and front entrance
  doors  with  a  combined  width  in excess of five feet, the owner shall
  install at least two lights, one on each side of the entrance way,  with
  an   aggregate   illumination   of   three  hundred  watts  incandescent
  illumination or its equivalent. If the minimum level of illumination  is
  maintained,  the  owner  may  determine  details of location, design and
  installation of lighting fixtures, subject, however, to  regulations  of
  the department with respect to the maximum height above or distance from
  the  entrance  way of such fixtures, and the electrical and other safety
  of their installation. The lights required by this subdivision shall  be
  kept burning from sunset on each day to sunrise on the day following.
    b.  The  owner  of  a  multiple dwelling shall install and maintain in
  every yard and court one or more lights of at least one hundred watts of
  incandescent illumination or its equivalent, in such  locations  as  the
  department  may prescribe. The lights required by this subdivision shall
  be kept burning from sunset on each day to sunrise on the day following.
