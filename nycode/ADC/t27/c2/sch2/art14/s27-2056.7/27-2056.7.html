Section 27-2056.7

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;   27-2056.7   Audit   and   inspection   by   department   following
  commissioner's order to abate. a. When  the  department  of  health  and
  mental  hygiene  issues  a  commissioner's  order  to  abate pursuant to
  section 173.13 of the New York city health code or a successor rule that
  addresses lead-based paint hazards in a  specific  dwelling  unit  in  a
  multiple  dwelling,  the  department, within fifteen days of such order,
  shall notify the owner of the multiple dwelling where the dwelling  unit
  is  located  that  the  owner  shall,  within  forty-five  days  of  the
  department's notice, provide to the department all records  required  to
  be  maintained  under  this  article.   Upon the department's receipt of
  those records and a  determination  that  there  may  exist  uncorrected
  lead-based  paint  hazards in dwelling units where a child of applicable
  age resides, the department within ten days  shall  attempt  to  inspect
  such  units  to  determine  whether  there are any violations of section
  27-2056.6 of this article.
    b. If the owner does not provide to  the  department  the  records  as
  mandated  by  subdivision a of this section, the department shall within
  forty-five days of such failure attempt to inspect dwelling units  where
  a  child  of  applicable  age resides to determine whether there are any
  violations of section 27-2056.6 of this article in such units.
    c.  The  department  is  not  required  to  undertake  the  procedures
  specified  in  this  section in a particular multiple dwelling if it has
  done so in such building during the prior twelve month period.
    d. Any owner who fails to comply with the provisions of  this  section
  in  accordance  with  the  rules of the department shall be liable for a
  class C immediately hazardous violation,  and  a  civil  penalty  in  an
  amount not to exceed one thousand dollars.
