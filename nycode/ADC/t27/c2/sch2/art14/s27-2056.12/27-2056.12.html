    &sect;  27-2056.12  Reporting. a. Within four months after the close of the
  first fiscal year after which this article takes effect  and  for  every
  fiscal  year thereafter, the commissioner shall provide to the council a
  written report on the department's implementation of this article during
  the preceding year. Such report shall include, at a minimum, an analysis
  of the  department's  program,  a  detailed  statement  of  revenue  and
  expenditures  and  statistical  section  designed  to provide a detailed
  explanation of the department's enforcement including, but  not  limited
  to, the following:
    (1)  the  number  of complaints for peeling paint in pre-1960 dwelling
  units where a child of applicable age resides, disaggregated by city  or
  non-city  ownership  of  the  building  which  is  the  subject  of  the
  complaint;
    (2) the number of inspections  by  the  department  pursuant  to  this
  article, disaggregated by the city or non-city ownership of the building
  where the inspection occurred;
    (3) the number of violations issued by the department pursuant to this
  article;
    (4) the number of violations issued pursuant to this article that were
  certified  as  corrected by the owner, the number of such certifications
  that did not result in the removal of such violations, and the number of
  civil actions brought by the department against such owners; and
    (5) the number of jobs performed in which violations  issued  pursuant
  to this article were corrected by the department, the total amount spent
  by  the  department  to  correct  the  conditions  that  resulted in the
  violations, and the average amount spent per dwelling  unit  to  correct
  such conditions; and
    (6)  a  statistical  profile  with  geographic  indexing,  such  as by
  community district, council  district,  and/or  zip  code,  of  multiple
  dwellings  in  which  violations  are placed, indicating the ages of the
  multiple dwellings and other  factors  relevant  to  the  prevalence  of
  lead-based  paint hazards, which may include the prior lead poisoning of
  a child in the multiple dwelling, outstanding violations, and  emergency
  repair charges.
    b.  The department of health and mental hygiene shall prepare a report
  on progress toward increasing screening rates and reducing the incidence
  rates of children newly identified with elevated blood lead levels. This
  report shall be utilized by the department in its implementation of this
  article. Such report shall be  submitted  to  the  council  within  nine
  months after the close of each calendar year.
    c.  The department shall maintain a central register of all department
  orders to correct a violation under this article.  Such  register  shall
  indicate,  if  applicable,  the  date  of  the complaint, address of the
  premises, and the date of each inspection and reinspection.
