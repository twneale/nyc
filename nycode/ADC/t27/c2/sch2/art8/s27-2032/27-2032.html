  alternative  to a central supply of heat or hot water, shall be governed
  by the provisions of this section.
    b. The capacity, number and location of such heaters shall be such  as
  to  furnish  the  same standard of heat or hot water supply, as the case
  may be, as is required to be furnished from a central heat or hot  water
  system.
    c.  Electric  heaters  shall be approved by Underwriters Laboratories,
  Inc.  and shall comply with applicable provisions of the  building  code
  and the multiple dwelling law.
    d.   Gas-fueled  heaters  shall  comply  with  article  nine  of  this
  subchapter and with applicable provisions of the building code  and  the

  shall  comply  with  such  section  by July fourteenth, nineteen hundred

  comply with all provisions of article nine of this subchapter.
    e.  The  owner  shall  not,  unless otherwise agreed between owner and
  tenant, be required to pay for the  gas  or  electricity  used  by  such
  heaters.
    f. Notwithstanding any provision of prior law, it shall be the duty of
  the  owner  to  keep  each such heater in good repair and good operating
  condition, regardless of the identity of the person originally owning or
  installing the heater.
    g. The owner shall instruct each successive tenant of an apartment  in
  which  such  heaters are installed as to safe and proper method of using
  and operating such heaters.
    h. The department may make and enforce  regulations  supplementary  to
