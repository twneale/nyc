Section 27-2009.1

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-2009.1  Rights  and  responsibilities  of  owners and tenants in
  relation to pets. a. Legislative declaration. The council  hereby  finds
  that  the enforcement of covenants contained in multiple dwelling leases
  which prohibit the harboring of household pets  has  led  to  widespread
  abuses by building owners or their agents, who knowing that a tenant has
  a  pet  for  an extended period of time, seek to evict the tenant and/or
  his or her pet  often  for  reasons  unrelated  to  the  creation  of  a
  nuisance.  Because  household  pets  are  kept for reasons of safety and
  companionship and under the existence of a continuing housing  emergency
  it  is  necessary to protect pet owners from retaliatory eviction and to
  safeguard the health, safety and welfare  of  tenants  who  harbor  pets
  under  the  circumstances  provided  herein, it is hereby found that the
  enactment of the provisions of this  section  is  necessary  to  prevent
  potential hardship and dislocation of tenants within this city.
    b.  Where a tenant in a multiple dwelling openly and notoriously for a
  period of three months or more following taking possession  of  a  unit,
  harbors  or has harbored a household pet or pets, the harboring of which
  is not prohibited by the multiple dwelling law, the housing  maintenance
  or the health codes of the city of New York or any other applicable law,
  and  the  owner or his or her agent has knowledge of this fact, and such
  owner fails within  this  three  month  period  to  commence  a  summary
  proceeding  or  action  to  enforce  a  lease  provision prohibiting the
  keeping of such household pets, such lease  provision  shall  be  deemed
  waived.
    c.  It  shall be unlawful for an owner or his or her agent, by express
  terms or otherwise, to restrict a tenant's rights as  provided  in  this
  section.  Any such restriction shall be unenforceable and deemed void as
  against public policy.
    d. The waiver provision of this section  shall  not  apply  where  the
  harboring  of  a  household  pet  causes  damage to the subject premise,
  creates a nuisance or interferes substantially with the  health,  safety
  or  welfare  of  other  tenants  or  occupants  of  the same or adjacent
  building or structure.
    e. The New York city  housing  authority  shall  be  exempt  from  the
  provisions of this section.
