Section 27-2021

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-2021  Receptacles for waste matter.  a. The owner or occupant in
  control of a dwelling shall provide and maintain metal  cans,  or  other
  receptacles jointly approved as to specifications by the department, the
  department  of  sanitation  and  the  department  of  health  and mental
  hygiene, for the exclusive use of  each  building,  which  shall  be  of
  sufficient  size  and  number  to contain the wastes accumulated in such
  building during a period of seventy-two hours. No  receptacle  shall  be
  filled to a height so as to prevent the effective closure thereof and no
  receptacle  shall  weigh  more  than one hundred pounds when filled. The
  receptacles shall be so constructed as to hold  their  contents  without
  leakage.  Metal  cans  shall  be  provided with tight-fitting covers and
  other receptacles shall be effectively closed.  When  requested  by  the
  department  of  sanitation,  the  owner  or  occupant  in  control shall
  separate and place in separate receptacles, ashes, organic and inorganic
  wastes.  Nothing  contained  in  this  subdivision  shall  prevent   the
  department,  the  department  of sanitation and the department of health
  and mental hygiene from jointly approving  as  to  specifications  other
  systems  for  the  disposal of waste utilizing containers of larger size
  and different construction as may be appropriate for such systems.
    b. Metal cans shall be kept within the dwelling or as required by  the
  department  until the time for removal of their contents when they shall
  be placed in front of the dwelling. When  inside  storage  is  required,
  receptacles  of  other  materials  shall  be  kept  in  a metal can or a
  rat-proof and fireproof room until the time of their removal  when  they
  shall  be  removed  from the metal can and be neatly stacked in front of
  the dwelling. After the contents have been removed by the department  of
  sanitation,  any  receptacles  remaining  shall  be returned promptly to
  their place of storage. Metal cans shall be kept covered  at  all  times
  and  shall  be  disinfected  regularly  and  maintained  in  a  sanitary
  condition. Yard sweepings, hedge cuttings, grass, leaves, earth,  stone,
  or bricks shall not be mixed with household wastes.
    c.  Newspapers,  wrapping  paper,  or other inorganic wastes which are
  likely to be blown or scattered about  the  streets  shall  be  securely
  bundled,  tied  or  packed  before  being  placed  for  collection. Such
  material shall be kept and placed for collection in the same  manner  as
  the receptacles.
