  in multiple dwellings. a. The owner of a  multiple  dwelling  shall  not
  allow  the  accumulation  except  in a lawful receptacle of ashes or any
  type of waste matter in any part of the premises.
    b. In multiple dwellings where the owner provides dumbwaiter  service,
  all waste matter shall be collected at least once daily and deposited in
  separate receptacles.
    c.  In multiple dwellings where no dumbwaiter service is provided, the
  owner shall provide between the hours of seven  a.m.  and  ten  a.m.  or
  between five p.m. and eight p.m. daily:
    (1)  a  sufficient number of receptacles but in no event less than two
  within the dwelling or other area approved by the department  which  are
  accessible  to  the  tenants. Such receptacles shall be removed promptly
  upon the expiration of the selected time period and taken to their place
  of storage; or
    (2) a pick-up service at each  dwelling  unit  to  collect  ashes  and
  wastes  for deposit in the receptacles referred to in section 27-2021 of
  this article.
    The owner shall post and maintain a notice in a conspicuous  place  in
  the dwelling informing the tenants of the hour and method of collection.
  A  new  notice  shall  be posted and maintained within forty-eight hours
  preceding any change in such hour or method.
    d. The tenant of a multiple dwelling shall dispose of waste matter  in
  accordance  with the method provided by the owner under subdivision b or
  c of this section. The tenant shall not accumulate any waste  matter  in
  his or her dwelling unit so as to create a condition which is unsanitary

    e.  Subdivisions  b,  c  and  d of this section shall not apply to any
  multiple dwelling where regular incinerator services or other  means  of
  disposal  approved  by the department are provided. The tenant in such a
  dwelling shall dispose of waste matter in  an  incinerator  or  by  such
  other  approved  means  of  disposal  and  shall  not  permit  wastes to
  accumulate so as to create a condition which is  unsanitary  or  a  fire
  hazard in the judgment of the department.
