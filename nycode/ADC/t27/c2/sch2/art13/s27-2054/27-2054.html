Section 27-2054

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;   27-2054   Residence  of  person  performing  janitorial  services;
  limitation on number of dwelling units served. The person  who  performs
  janitorial  services  for  a  multiple dwelling of nine or more dwelling
  units  (other  than  where  janitorial  services  are  performed  on   a
  twenty-four-hour-a-day  basis  under paragraph three of subdivision b of
  section 27-2053 of this article) shall reside in or within a distance of
  one block or two hundred feet from the dwelling, whichever  is  greater,
  unless  the  owner  resides in the multiple dwelling. Where two or three
  multiple dwellings are connected or adjoining, it shall  be  sufficient,
  however, that the person who performs janitorial services resides in one
  of  these,  but no person who performs janitorial services for more than
  one multiple dwelling may service more than sixty-five  dwelling  units.
  Regardless  of  residence  the  janitor  must have a telephone where the
  janitor may reasonably be expected to be reached.
