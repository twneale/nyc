Section 27-2099

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-2099  Registration  statement;  change of ownership or title. a.
  When the owner of a dwelling, who is required  to  register  under  this
  article, conveys title to the dwelling to another, the transferor shall,
  on  the  day  of such transfer, notify the department by regular mail of
  the name, residence and business address of the new owner,  or,  if  the
  new owner is a corporation, of the name and address of such corporation.
  The  registration  statement  in accordance with section 27-2098 of this
  article shall be presented by  the  new  owner  to  the  office  of  the
  register  of  the  city  of New York, or the county clerk as required by
  subdivision c of this section if such owner records such deed, or to the
  department if the deed is not recorded, and in no event more  than  five
  days  from  the  date  of taking of title; however, the failure by a new
  owner to file such registration statement shall not impair the  validity
  of his or her title.
    b.  When  the ownership of a dwelling changes by operation of law, the
  new owner, if required to register, shall file a registration  statement
  in  accordance with section 27-2098 of this article not more than thirty
  days from the date that title devolved upon him or her.
    c. The office of the register of the city of New York or county  clerk
  shall  not record or accept for recording any deed transferring title to
  real property or a lease or memorandum of lease of  an  entire  multiple
  dwelling  unless  such  instrument  is  accompanied  by the registration
  statements required under this article, with their appropriate fees,  or
  an affidavit stating that the deed, or lease or memorandum of lease does
  not  affect  a  multiple dwelling and such registration is not required.
  Such registration statements and the fees therefor shall be forwarded to
  the department for filing and acceptance.
    d. (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, after  thirty  days
  have elapsed from the date that title to a dwelling is conveyed to a new
  owner or devolves upon a new owner by operation of law, if the new owner
  has not filed a registration statement in relation to such dwelling, the
  department may invalidate the former owner's last valid registration for
  such  dwelling  upon  application  by  such former owner for the limited
  purpose of service of notices or orders  authorized  or  required  under
  this  code to be served by the department upon the last registered owner
  or last registered managing agent. To effect such limited  invalidation,
  the  former  owner shall submit such documentation as is satisfactory to
  the department that the ownership of the dwelling has changed  and  that
  such  former  owner no longer owns the dwelling; provided, however, that
  such  registration  shall  remain  valid  for  all  purposes  until  the
  department  informs  such former owner in writing that such registration
  has been invalidated for such limited purpose.
    (2) Where a notice or order is authorized or required under this  code
  to  be  served  by the department upon the last registered owner or last
  registered managing agent and the department has  invalidated  the  last
  valid registration pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision for the
  limited  purpose  of  service  of notices or orders, such service may be
  made by personal delivery of the notice or order to a person  in  direct
  or  indirect control of the premises or by mailing a copy thereof to the
  attention of "owner" or "managing agent"  at  such  dwelling;  provided,
  however,  that such manner of service is authorized only until such time
  as a valid registration is subsequently filed for the dwelling.
