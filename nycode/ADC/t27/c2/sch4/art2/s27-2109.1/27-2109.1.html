<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-2109.1 Notice by a mortgagee commencing an action to foreclose a
  mortgage on  residential  real  property.  (a)  1.  Any  mortgagee  that
  commences an action in a court of competent jurisdiction in the state of
  New York to foreclose a mortgage on residential real property within the
  city  of  New  York  shall  provide  notice to the department, in a form
  prescribed by the department, within fifteen  days  of  service  of  the
  pleadings  commencing  such  action. If such action was commenced before
  the effective date of the local law that added this section, and remains
  pending as of such effective date, notification shall be provided within
  thirty days of such effective date, provided, however,  that  no  notice
  shall  be  required  for  actions  commenced prior to February 13, 2010,
  regardless of whether such action remains pending as of  such  effective
  date.  Such  notice  shall  include,  but  need  not  be limited to, the
  following  information:  (i)  the  name  of  the   mortgagee   plaintiff
  commencing  such  action  and  the mailing address, telephone number and
  e-mail address of such mortgagee plaintiff, and,  when  applicable,  the
  name  of  a  principal or corporate officer of such mortgagee plaintiff,
  and the mailing address, telephone number and  e-mail  address  of  such
  principal  or  corporate officer; (ii) the name of the defendant in such
  action; (iii) the identification of such residential  real  property  by
  street  address  and  block  and  lot  number,  (iv)  the  date  of  the
  commencement of such action, (v) the court  in  which  such  action  was
  commenced, and (vi) such other information as the department may require
  by  rule.  For  the purposes of this section, "mortgagee" shall mean any
  person that commences an action to foreclose a mortgage  on  residential
  real  property  including,  but  not  limited  to, a lender, assignee or
  mortgage loan service provider that commences such an action.
    2. A mortgagee shall notify the department within fifteen days of  the
  discontinuance  of  an action for which notice pursuant to paragraph one
  of this subdivision has been received by the department, the issuance of
  a judgment in such action, or the sale of the real property as a  result
  of such action.
    3.  The  department  shall  maintain  on  its  website  a  list of all
  properties with twenty or more units, identified by block and lot number
  along with the  name,  mailing  address  and  telephone  number  of  the
  mortgagee  plaintiff  and  the  name  of  the defendant for which notice
  pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision has  been  received.  Such
  list  shall  be  updated  at a minimum on the first business day of each
  month. The department shall report on its website each three months: (i)
  the total number of foreclosure actions commenced during the immediately
  preceding three months for which notice pursuant  to  paragraph  one  of
  this  subdivision  has been received by the department, disaggregated by
  community district; and (ii) the total  number  of  foreclosure  actions
  pending,  for  which  notice  pursuant to paragraphs one and two of this
  subdivision has  been  received  by  the  department,  disaggregated  by
  community   district.  The  department  shall  provide  the  information
  provided to it pursuant to paragraphs one and two of this subdivision to
  one or more agencies for  which  the  department  determines  that  such
  information  furthers such agency or agencies' duties, including but not
  limited to the enforcement of section 28-210.1 of this code  or  related
  provisions, and to any other city agency upon request by such agency.
    b. Any mortgagee who fails to notify the department in accordance with
  subdivision  a  of  this  section  shall  be  liable for a civil penalty
  enforceable by the department. Such civil penalty shall not  exceed  one
  thousand  dollars  for  each week that there is a failure to notify. The
  failure to notify shall not be deemed to affect in any way  any  pending
  legal proceeding related to such residential real property.

    c.  The  provisions of this section shall not apply to any foreclosure
  actions brought by a governmental entity.
