Section 27-2098

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-2098  Registration  statement;  contents.  a.  The  registration
  statement shall include the following information:
    (1) An identification of the premises by block and lot number, and  by
  the  street numbers and names of all streets contiguous to the dwelling,
  or by such other description as will enable the department to locate the
  dwelling. If the dwelling is a garden-type maisonette  dwelling  project
  required  to  register  pursuant to paragraph four of subdivision (b) of
  section  27-2099  of  this  article,  the  owner  who  files  the  first
  registration  statement  with the department for such project shall list
  on the registration statement the street numbers for  each  dwelling  in
  the  project  and  shall  designate  an  address  by  which  the project
  dwellings are to be identified by the department.
    (2) An identification of the owner by  name,  residence  and  business
  address. If the owner is a corporation, the identification shall include
  the  name  and  address  of  such  corporation  together with the names,
  residences and business addresses of the officers. If  the  owner  of  a
  multiple  dwelling  is  a  corporation,  the  identification  shall also
  include the names and addresses of any person whose share  of  ownership
  of the corporation exceeds twenty-five percent. For the purposes of this
  subdivision,  any person owning a share of a parent corporation shall be
  deemed to be an owner of a share of a subsidiary  corporation  equal  to
  the  product  of  the  percentage  of his or her ownership of the parent
  corporation multiplied by the percentage  of  the  parent  corporation's
  ownership  of  the  subsidiary  corporation.  If the owner of a multiple
  dwelling is a partnership, the identification shall include the name and
  business address  of  such  partnership  together  with  the  names  and
  business  addresses of each general partner and for each limited partner
  whose share of ownership of the partnership exceeds twenty-five percent,
  the names and business addresses of all such limited  partners.  If  the
  owner is under the age of eighteen years or has been judicially declared
  incompetent, his or her legal representative shall file the registration
  statement.
    (3)  If the dwelling is a multiple dwelling, the name and address of a
  managing agent  designated  by  the  owner  to  be  in  control  of  and
  responsible  for  the  maintenance and operation of such dwelling and to
  authorize, on behalf of the  owner,  the  correction  of  any  emergency
  conditions or the making of any emergency repairs for which the owner is
  responsible  under  the  provisions of the multiple dwelling law or this
  code. To qualify for such designation,  an  agent  shall  be  a  natural
  person over the age of twenty-one years and shall reside within the city
  or  customarily and regularly attend a business office maintained within
  the city. An owner or corporate officer who  meets  such  qualifications
  may be designated to serve and registered as the managing agent.
    (4)  If  the  dwelling  is a multiple dwelling or a one- or two-family
  dwelling where neither the owner nor  any  family  member  occupies  the
  dwelling,  the  number  of  a  telephone within the greater metropolitan
  area, as identified by the department, where an owner or officer, if the
  owner is a corporation, or the managing agent may reasonably be expected
  to be reached at all  times.  The  telephone  number  contained  in  the
  registration statement shall not constitute a public record and shall be
  accessible  only  to  duly  authorized  employees  or  officers  of  the
  department and used exclusively by such personnel in connection with  an
  emergency  arising  on  the  premises for which the owner is responsible
  under the provisions of the multiple dwelling  law  or  this  code.  The
  department  may  promulgate  regulations  to implement the provisions of
  this paragraph.
    (5) If the dwelling is a one- or two-family dwelling and  neither  the
  owner  nor any family member occupies the dwelling, the name and address

  of a natural person who is over  the  age  of  twenty-one  years  and  a
  resident  of  the  city,  designated  by the owner to receive service of
  notices, orders or summonses issued by the department.
    (6)  For  the purposes of this section, a United States postal service
  mail delivery box, a mail delivery box maintained  through  a  privately
  operated  mail  handling  facility  or  the address at which any similar
  service is provided shall be deemed an invalid business address and  the
  department  shall  not  accept  for  filing  any  registration statement
  containing only such an address.
    b. The registration statement shall be signed by the owner or, if  the
  owner  is a corporation, by any officer. In the appropriate case, either
  the managing agent or  the  designee  described  in  paragraph  five  of
  subdivision  a  of  this  section  shall  sign the statement to indicate
  consent to the designation except that such consent is not  required  if
  an  owner  or  officer  of  a  corporation is registered as the managing
  agent.
    c. The registration statement shall be filed on forms to be prescribed
  by the department and shall be accompanied by a filing fee  of  thirteen
  dollars.  In  the  case  of  an  owner  previously  registered  with the
  department, no new filing fee shall be required  for  the  filing  of  a
  supplemental registration.
    d.  The  department  may require that a multiple dwelling registration
  statement contain such other information, in addition to the information
  specifically required by this article, which it deems to be  related  to
  the ownership or management of such dwelling.
