  designated by the  owner  for  the  collection  of  rental  payments  if
  different  from  the  managing  agent  to tenant. a. At the time of each
  rental payment, either a rent bill or receipt for such payment  of  rent
  shall  be  issued  to the tenant of an apartment or rooming unit stating
  the name and New York City address of the  managing  agent  (or  of  the
  designee described in paragraph five of subdivision a of section 27-2098
  of  this  article),  or,  owner  as recorded in the current registration
  statement on file in the department, and of the agent designated by  the

  managing agent. The rent bill or receipt for such payment of rent  shall
  be  printed on the letterhead of the managing agent or on the letterhead
  of the New York City address of the building owner. If there  is  a  new
  managing  agent,  owner,  or  agent  designated  by  the  owner  for the
  collection of rental payments, the rent  bill  or  receipt  shall  state
  this.  The  registered  name and address of the owner may be substituted
  for that of the managing agent if the  owner  resides  or  maintains  an
  office where he or she customarily transacts business within the city.
    b.  Written  notice  of  a  change  of  managing agent or of the agent
  designated by the  owner  for  the  collection  of  rental  payments  if
  different  from  the  managing  agent shall be delivered by the owner by
  regular mail to each tenant. Such notice shall be  postmarked  no  later
  than  fifteen  days  prior  to the date the next rental payment is to be
  collected and shall contain the telephone number  of  the  new  managing
  agent  or the new agent designated by the owner for collection of rental
  payments if different from the managing agent.
