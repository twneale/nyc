Section 27-2091

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 27-2091 Power to issue orders. a. The department shall have power to
  issue  notices  and orders to secure compliance with the requirements of
  this code, of the multiple dwelling law, and of other  state  and  local
  laws that impose requirements on dwellings.
    b.  The  failure  to  comply  with a notice or order of the department
  issued  pursuant  to  this  code  within  the  time  provided  for  such
  compliance  in  the  order  shall  be  dealt with in accordance with the
  provisions of this code. Nothing contained herein shall, however,  limit
  or  render  inapplicable  other  provisions  of  the administrative code
  relating to the enforcement of orders of the department or  commissioner
  of the department under other applicable provisions of law.
    c.  The  department  shall have the power to issue an order to correct
  any underlying condition existing in a building that has  caused  or  is
  causing  a  violation  of this code, of the multiple dwelling law, or of
  other state and local laws that impose requirements on dwellings.
    1. Such order may be issued to an owner of a building that  meets  the
  criteria promulgated by the department in rules.
    2.  The  department  may  file  such order in the office of the county
  clerk in the county in which the building is located. Where  such  order
  has  been  filed  by  the department and complied with by the owner, the
  department shall file a rescission of the order with such county clerk.
    3. An owner shall comply with such order and submit such documentation
  as the department may require indicating compliance with  the  order  no
  later  than  four  months  after  the  order  has been issued, provided,
  however, that the department may extend the deadline for compliance by a
  period not to exceed two months, in accordance with criteria promulgated
  by the department in rules. If such owner  fails  to  comply  with  such
  order,  the  department  may perform all or part of the work required by
  such order.
    4. All amounts for expenses incurred by  the  department  pursuant  to
  this subdivision that remain unpaid by an owner, shall constitute a debt
  recoverable  from  the  owner  and a lien upon the building and lot, and
  upon the rents and other income thereof. The provisions of article eight
  of subchapter five of this code shall govern the effect and  enforcement
  of  such  debt and lien. The department may serve a statement of account
  upon an owner for such amounts pursuant to section 27-2129 of this code.
    5. Notwithstanding any provision of this  code  to  the  contrary,  an
  owner  who  fails  to  comply  with  an  order  issued  pursuant to this
  subdivision shall be subject to a civil penalty of one thousand  dollars
  for  each  dwelling  unit  that  is the subject of such order, provided,
  however, that the total amount of such penalty shall not  be  less  than
  five thousand dollars.
