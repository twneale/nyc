  permitted herein. A building specified as a one-family residence in  the
  certificate of occupancy or, if there is no certificate of occupancy, as

  building in which two or more dwelling units have  been  constructed  in
  accordance  with  the  certificate  of  occupancy,  or  if  there  is no
  certificate of occupancy, as determined by the department, may have  one
  meter  for  each  dwelling  unit and one additional meter for the common
  areas of  the  building,  provided  that  smoke  detecting  devices  are
  installed   in   all   common  areas  in  accordance  with  departmental
  requirements. Such common areas may include boiler rooms, shared hallway
  lighting, shared stairway lighting, and outdoor perimeter  lighting  but
  shall  not  include  any  habitable space. In the event that a meter has
  been found to have been installed or  to  exist  in  violation  of  this
  section,  the department may take action leading to the disconnecting of

  section 27-3020 of this chapter.
    j.  Any application for a permit filed with the department in relation
  to a request for  the  authorization  to  power  or  energize/electrical
  wiring  or  appliances  or power generation equipment, or in relation to
  work that will result in the issuance of a new or amended certificate of
  occupancy  must  include  a  statement,  signed  and   sealed   by   the
  electrician,   that   the  building  owner  or  his  or  her  authorized
  representative has authorized in writing the work to be performed.  This
  signed  authorization  must be available upon request by the department.
  In addition,  any  electrical  application  filed  with  the  department
  involving  the energizing of a meter, must include as well, a statement,
  signed and sealed by the electrician, that the building owner or his  or
  her  authorized representative has indicated in writing the intended use
  or purpose of such meter and  has  affirmed  that  such  meter  will  be

  maintained  in  compliance  with  the provisions of this section.   This
  statement must be available upon request by the department.
    k.  Any  authorization  to  power  or  energize  electrical  wiring or
  appliances issued by the department shall expire ninety days  after  the
  date  of issuance unless a sign-off has been issued by the department or
  an extension of such authorization has been granted by  the  department.
  In the event no such sign-off has been issued or extension authorization
  granted,  the department may take action leading to the disconnecting of
  such meter(s) in accordance with the notice requirements  set  forth  in
  section 27-3020 of this chapter.
    l.  Any permit application filed with the department that requires the
  selective coordination of overcurrent protective  devices  must  include
  documentation  from  a professional engineer demonstrating how selective
  coordination was achieved, including but not limited  to  short  circuit
  overlay  curves  and calculations. Such documentation shall be submitted
  to the department prior to sign off.
    m. For permit applications requiring compliance  with  the  applicable
  energy conservation code, documentation demonstrating compliance must be
  available upon request by the department.
    n.  The  provisions  of  this  section  shall not apply to low voltage
  electrical work.
    o. An application for a work permit may be amended by filing with  the
  department a post-approval amendment in a form prescribed by rule of the
  department.
