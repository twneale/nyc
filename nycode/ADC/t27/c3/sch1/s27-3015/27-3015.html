Section 27-3015

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-3015  Renewal  of master electrician's and special electrician's
  licenses.  a. Any license and seal issued  hereunder  shall  expire  one
  year  from the year of issuance on the licensee's date of birth for that
  year irrespective of the date of issue.  Such  license  may  be  renewed
  every year thereafter without examination, provided application for such
  renewal,  accompanied  by  the  renewal  fees  prescribed above and such
  information as may be required by the commissioner to ensure  compliance
  with  section 27-3016 of this chapter and evidence of insurance coverage
  in compliance with section 27-3013 of  this  chapter,  shall  have  been
  filed prior to the expiration of the existing license.
    1.  Where  an  applicant can show good and sufficient cause for his or
  her  inability  to  renew  his  or  her  license  and  seal  before  its
  expiration,   the  commissioner  may,  upon  submission  of  a  complete
  application  for  late  renewal  within  ninety  (90)  days  after   the
  expiration of such license, permit the issuance, without examination, of
  a  new license and seal upon payment of the prescribed fees for such new
  license  and  seal  within  said  ninety  days.  The  commissioner   may
  promulgate  rules  authorizing the renewal of a license up to six months
  after the expiration of such license for extenuating circumstances.
    2. No license shall be renewed and no new license and  seal  shall  be
  issued  unless  all outstanding fees required by section 27-3018 of this
  code have been paid.
    3. Renewal  shall  also  be  subject  to  the  licensee's  good  moral
  character.    As  provided in department rule, the licensee's failure to
  clear open violations in a timely manner may result in  the  refusal  to
  renew a license until the violations are resolved.
    4.  The commissioner may promulgate rules requiring applicants for the
  renewal of master or special electrician's licenses to submit proof,  in
  such  form  as  he  or  she  shall  determine, that, in each year of the
  license  term,  such  applicant  completed  at  least  eight  hours   of
  continuing  education  courses  approved  by  the department. Such proof
  shall be submitted with the license renewal application.
    b. If a master  electrician's  or  special  electrician's  license  is
  suspended  for  cause,  and  the restoration thereof is conditional upon
  some action to be taken by the holder of  the  master  electrician's  or
  special electrician's license and the holder fails to take action before
  the  expiration  of  the  license,  such  failure shall be cause for the
  denial of the subsequent application to renew the license and seal.
