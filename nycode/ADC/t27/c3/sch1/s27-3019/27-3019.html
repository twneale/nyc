Section 27-3019

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 27-3019 Modification, suspension or revocation, electrical sign-off,
  permit or other authorization. a. The commissioner may at any time by an
  order  in  writing  for  good cause shown, modify, suspend or revoke any
  sign-off, permit or other authorization issued pursuant to this  chapter
  for  failure  to  comply  with  the  provisions  of  this  code or other
  applicable laws or rules; or whenever there has been any false statement
  or any misrepresentation as to a material fact  in  the  application  or
  submittal documents upon the basis of which such approval was issued; or
  whenever  a permit has been issued in error and conditions are such that
  the permit should not have been issued. Such  notice  shall  inform  the
  permit holder of the reasons for the proposed action and that the permit
  holder  has  the  right  to  present  to  the commissioner or his or her
  representative within ten business days of delivery  of  the  notice  by
  hand  or  fifteen  calendar  days  of  the  posting  of  notice by mail,
  information as to why the permit should not be  modified,  suspended  or
  revoked. A copy of any such order shall be served in the manner provided
  in  this subchapter. No person other than the commissioner or an officer
  or  employee  of  the  department,  duly  authorized  thereto   by   the
  commissioner,  shall  alter  or  amend  any  sign-off,  permit  or other
  authorization issued pursuant to  this  chapter  or  the  rules  of  the
  department.
    b.  Immediate  suspension in cases of imminent peril. The commissioner
  may immediately suspend any permit without prior notice  to  the  permit
  holder  when  the  commissioner has determined that an imminent peril to
  life or property exists. The commissioner shall immediately  notify  the
  permit  holder  that  the  permit  has  been  suspended  and the reasons
  therefore, that it is proposed to be revoked, and that the permit holder
  has  the  right  to  present  to  the  commissioner  or   his   or   her
  representative  within  ten  business  days of delivery of the notice by
  hand or  fifteen  calendar  days  of  the  posting  of  notice  by  mail
  information as to why the permit should not be revoked.
