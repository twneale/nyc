Section 27-3013

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 27-3013 Business establishments and master electricians. a. Place of
  Business, generally.
    1.  Every  master electrician business shall at all times have a place
  of business at a specified address in the city at which the licensee may
  be contacted by the public and the  department  by  mail,  telephone  or
  other  modes  of communication, located in a business zone in conformity
  with the zoning regulations and kept  open  during  the  usual  business
  hours unless other means acceptable to the commissioner is provided.
    2.  At such place of business, there shall at all times be prominently
  displayed a permanent sign of a minimum size of one hundred fifty square
  inches, stating the name of such license holder, the license  number  of
  such  licensee,  and  the  words  "licensed  electrician"  or  "licensed
  electrical contractor" on a plate glass  window  and  the  name  of  the
  master  electrician  business  if different than the name of the license
  holder; or an  outside  sign  of  permanent  construction  fastened  and
  readily  visible  to  pedestrians;  or  if  such place of business be an
  office, commercial or industrial building, the names shall be  indicated
  on  the  entrance door of the particular portion of the premises or on a
  bulletin board on the main floor.
    3. All business vehicles, advertising, websites and stationery used in
  connection with electrical work required to be performed under a license
  issued to a master  electrician  shall  display  prominently  the  words
  "N.Y.C.  Licensed  Electrician",  the  license number of the responsible
  representative of such business and of  all  other  master  electricians
  associated  with  such  business, the authorization number of the master
  electrician business and  the  business  address.  If  the  business  is
  conducted  under  a  trade name, or is a partnership or corporation, the
  trade name, partnership, or corporate name shall contain the  root  word
  "electric" and be displayed prominently.
    4. The applicant for approval of a master electrician business under a
  license  issued  to  a  master  electrician  shall  have  filed with the
  commissioner, in such form as the commissioner may  direct,  proof  that
  such  applicant carries all insurance required by law including, but not
  limited to, workers' compensation, disability and one million dollars of
  general  liability  insurance  listing  the  department  as  certificate
  holder, and that the applicant business is financially responsible. Each
  policy  of  insurance  shall contain a provision of continuing liability
  notwithstanding any recovery under such policy.
    5. The applicant shall indicate the name and  license  number  of  the
  master  electrician who shall serve as the responsible representative of
  such business, and, if the business is a partnership or corporation, the
  names of all other master electricians associated  with  such  business.
  Upon  approval  of  such  application  the  commissioner  shall issue an
  authorization number to the business. The authorization number shall  be
  included  on  all  applications  for  permits  and  any  other documents
  required to be filed with the department.
    6. The office or other place where the master electrician business  is
  to  be  conducted  may  be  shared  by  one  or  more master electrician
  businesses.   However, each business whether  in  the  form  of  a  sole
  proprietorship,   partnership  or  corporation,  shall  distinguish  its
  identity from any other business sharing the  same  office  space.  Such
  distinctions  shall  be  maintained  in  a  manner  satisfactory  to the
  department.
    b. Business Conduct
    1. A master electrician business shall be principally engaged  in  the
  business  of  performing electrical work in or on buildings, premises or
  lots in the city.

    2. In the case of a partnership or corporation, a master electrician's
  license may be separately held by more than one partner or officer as  a
  representative  of  such  partnership  or corporation; however, only one
  master electrician shall  be  the  responsible  representative  of  such
  corporation  or  partnership.  Under  no  circumstances  shall  any  one
  licensee represent more than one business at any one time.
    3. A master electrician representing  a  master  electrician  business
  shall,  during  the  hours the business is engaged in the performance of
  electrical work, devote his or her full time to the  operation  of  such
  business.
    4.  (i)  Applications  for  permits  and  any  other document that the
  commissioner may require to be filed with the department, shall bear the
  stamp of the master electrician's seal as well as the signature  of  the
  responsible representative of the master electrician business or, if the
  business  is  a  partnership  or corporation, such document may bear the
  stamp of the seal and the signature of a master electrician who files on
  behalf of such business acting pursuant to a written  delegation,  filed
  with  the  department,  from  the  responsible  representative  of  such
  business. For applications and other documents submitted electronically,
  the digital signature and imprint of the seal  may  be  submitted  in  a
  manner authorized by the commissioner.
    (ii)  The  responsible  representative  of a business may not delegate
  such authority to a master electrician who is not  an  officer  of  such
  corporation  or  a  partner  of  such  partnership.  Such  person  shall
  personally sign applications for permits. The responsible representative
  of a business shall have the authority to make final determinations  and
  shall have full responsibility for the manner in which the work is done,
  except  that  where  work  is  done under a permit issued pursuant to an
  application bearing the signature  and  seal  of  a  master  electrician
  acting   pursuant   to   a   written  delegation  from  the  responsible
  representative of such business, both the responsible representative  of
  such  business  and the master electrician who signed and affixed his or
  her seal to the  application  for  such  permit  shall  be  jointly  and
  severally responsible for the manner in which the work is done.
    c. Changes to Business.
    1.  The  holder  of  a  master  electrician's  license shall report in
  writing to the license board any change in the place of business  within
  thirty  (30) days of the change. If such change occurs prior to issuance
  of the license, an applicant shall report  the  change  to  the  license
  board within fourteen (14) days of the change.
    2. The approval of a master electrician business is valid only as long
  as  the  responsible  representative  identified  on the application for
  approval of the master electrician business actively participates in the
  actual  operation  of  the  business.  In  the   event   a   responsible
  representative   leaves   a   master   electrician  business,  both  the
  representative and the business must notify  the  license  board  within
  thirty (30) days of the change.
    (i)  A corporation or partnership must notify the license board of the
  death of a responsible representative within thirty (30) days after such
  death. Failure to do so shall be deemed sufficient cause for  suspending
  or  revoking  the  approval  to  do  business  of the master electrician
  business  or  the  license  of  the  master  electrician.  The  decedent
  licensee's  legal  representative  may, with the commissioner's consent,
  retain the licensee's license and seal for the purpose of completing all
  unfinished work of such licensee for which plans have been approved  and
  permits  issued,  provided  that  such work is performed by or under the
  direct supervision of a licensed electrician.

    (ii) Except as  otherwise  provided  by  rule,  a  master  electrician
  business  whether  in the form of a corporation, a partnership or a sole
  proprietorship, may continue to engage in  the  business  of  performing
  electrical  work  only so long as the responsible representative of such
  business  identified  on  the  application  for  approval  of the master
  electrician business remains an officer of such corporation,  a  partner
  of such partnership or the proprietor of such sole proprietorship unless
  the  department  approves  a change in the responsible representative as
  provided  in  this  section.  The  commissioner  may  promulgate   rules
  providing  for the continuation of a master electrician business pending
  the approval of a new responsible representative.
    (iii) Except as otherwise provided  in  such  rules,  the  revocation,
  suspension,   license   deactivation   or   non-renewal  of  the  master
  electrician's license of the  responsible  representative  of  a  master
  electrician  business  automatically revokes its approval to do business
  and cancels any  delegation  of  authority  given  by  such  responsible
  representative  to  another  master  electrician  associated  with  such
  business pending the approval by the department  of  a  new  responsible
  representative.
    3. Except as otherwise provided by rule, a master electrician business
  shall  not  change  its  name,  form  or  designate  a  new  responsible
  representative without the prior approval of the license board. Approval
  of an application for a change is conditional upon the following: filing
  the necessary forms, payment of the prescribed fee and full  payment  of
  all fees incurred with respect to such business prior to the date of the
  change.  Except  as otherwise provided by rule, a requested change shall
  not be approved if  there  are  any  outstanding  fees  related  to  the
  licensee's  or  master  electrician business's professional dealings due
  and  owing  to  the  department   or   outstanding   violation   notices
  attributable to the licensee or the master electrician business.
    4.  A master electrician's license and a special electrician's license
  and seal shall not be held by any person at the same time.
    5. The  holder  of  a  master  electrician's  license,  upon  entering
  employment  as a special electrician, shall deactivate his or her master
  electrician's  license  and  seal  and  change   over   to   a   special
  electrician's  license  and  seal  to  cover the building, buildings, or
  parts thereof, for which he or she will be employed.
    6. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent two  or  more
  master  electrician  businesses  from  entering  into a joint venture of
  limited duration for a particular project in accordance with  the  rules
  of the department. An application for a permit involving a joint venture
  shall  so  indicate  on  the  application  and shall identify all of the
  master electrician businesses that are parties to such joint venture  by
  name  and  authorization number and the names and license numbers of the
  responsible representatives of such businesses. The application shall be
  signed by the responsible representative of one of the  parties  to  the
  joint  venture  on  behalf  of  all such parties and all of such parties
  shall be jointly and severally liable for any fees due with  respect  to
  electrical  work  performed  by such joint venture and for violations of
  this chapter and the rules of the department arising out of such work.
