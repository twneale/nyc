Section 27-3020

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-3020  Supplying or discontinuing electrical energy. a. Except as
  otherwise provided in this code, no person, partnership  or  corporation
  shall  supply,  or  cause  to be supplied or used, electrical energy for
  light, heat or power, signaling,  alarm  or  data  transmission  to  any
  wiring  or  appliance  in  any  building  unless  a  sign-off  or  other
  authorization as set forth in the rules of  the  department  authorizing
  the  use  of  said  wiring  or  appliance  shall have been issued by the
  commissioner.
    b. If, in the judgment of the commissioner, after due inspection,  the
  continued use of any electric wiring or appliances in or on any building
  or  structure  shall  be unsafe or dangerous to persons or property, the
  commissioner may cause such wires or appliances to be disconnected  from
  the supply of electrical energy and to seal the wiring and appliances so
  disconnected.  Thereafter,  no  person  shall cause or permit electrical
  energy to be supplied to the wiring or appliances so  sealed  until  the
  same  shall have been made safe and the commissioner shall have issued a
  certificate to  that  effect;  provided,  however,  that  no  wiring  or
  appliances shall be disconnected pursuant to this section until a notice
  in   writing,  stating  specifically  the  reason  why  such  wiring  or
  appliances must be disconnected, shall have been served, as provided  in
  this  chapter,  and a duplicate thereof shall have been delivered to the
  person supplying the electrical energy to such wiring or appliances.
