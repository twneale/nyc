Section 27-3021.1

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  27-3021.1  Electric  meter  installation;  restriction.  No  public
  utility shall supply electricity to a one, two,  three  or  four  family
  residence  building,  nor  shall  such  utility energize more electrical
  meters in a building than the number of distinct and separate residences
  in  such  building  as  authorized  in  the  certificate  of   occupancy
  applicable  thereto,  or  if  there  is  no certificate of occupancy, as
  determined by the department, without first receiving  a  sign-off  from
  the department.  In the event that an owner of a one, two, three or four
  family  building  wants  to install an additional electrical meter other
  than provided for herein, approval shall be obtained in writing from the
  department.  A  public  utility  shall  not  install   such   additional
  electrical  meter without such approval. A building in which two or more
  dwelling units have been constructed in accordance with the  certificate
  of  occupancy, or if there is no certificate of occupancy, as determined
  by the department, may have one meter for each  dwelling  unit  and  one
  additional  meter  for  the  common areas of the building, provided that
  smoke detecting devices are installed in all common areas in  accordance
  with  departmental  requirements.  Such  common areas may include boiler
  rooms, shared hallway lighting, shared stairway  lighting,  and  outdoor
  perimeter  lighting  but  shall  not include any habitable space. In the
  event that a meter has been found to have been installed or to exist  in
  violation  of this section, the utility must report such findings to the
  department, which may take action leading to the disconnecting  of  such
  meter  in  accordance  with the notice requirements set forth in section
  27-3020 of this code.
