  fees. a.  Before  any  master  electrician's  or  special  electrician's
  license  will be issued or renewed, the applicant shall pay a license or
  renewal fee as prescribed by the department's  rules.  The  commissioner
  may  exempt  any agency, as defined in chapter fifty-two of the charter,
  from paying the aforementioned fees for  licensed  special  electricians
  who are employees of such agencies.
    b.  Seal. The holder of a master electrician's license shall be issued
  a seal, of a design or form authorized by the commissioner, bearing  the
  holder's  full  name,  license  number,  and the legend "licensed master
  electrician." The holder of a special  electrician's  license  shall  be
  issued  a  seal,  of  a  design and form authorized by the commissioner,
  bearing the holder's full name, license number, and the legend "licensed
  special electrician."
    c. No license shall be transferable. The seal is the property  of  the
  department and is not transferable by the licensee.
    d.  The  loss  or  theft  of a license or seal must be reported to the
  department within five calendar days. Before any license or seal will be
  reissued, the applicant shall pay a reissuance fee as prescribed by  the
  department's rules.
    e.  An  application for a change of license from master electrician to
  special electrician shall involve the issuance of a new license and seal
  with or without examinations as the commissioner may direct.
    f. An application for a change  of  license  from  special  to  master
  electrician  shall  be  granted  only  upon  compliance  by  the special
  electrician with all applicable provisions of this chapter and the rules
  of the department.
    g. Each license and seal shall be issued for one year and the full fee
  shall be payable irrespective of the date of issue.
    h. Not more than one  license  and/or  seal  shall  be  issued  to  an
  individual  and no individual shall make or cause to be made a duplicate
  of such license or seal.
