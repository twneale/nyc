Section 27-3013.1

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 27-3013.1 Business establishments and special electricians. a. Place
  of Business, generally.
    1.  A  special electrician shall at all times have a place of business
  at a specified address  in  the  city  at  which  the  licensee  may  be
  contacted  by  the  department  by  mail,  telephone  or  other modes of
  communication.  His or her license shall plainly indicate the address or
  addresses of the building, buildings or parts  thereof  for  which  such
  license is issued.
    2.  The  commissioner  may  issue  more than one special license for a
  building or buildings if, in the  commissioner's  judgment,  he  or  she
  deems  it  necessary  for  the  proper  operation and maintenance of the
  electric wiring and equipment of the building or buildings involved.
    b. Insurance. An applicant for approval as a special electrician shall
  have filed with the commissioner, in such form as the  commissioner  may
  direct,  proof  that  such  applicant's  employer  carries all insurance
  required by law including, but not limited  to,  workers'  compensation,
  disability  and  one  million  dollars  of  general  liability insurance
  listing the department as certificate holder. Each policy  of  insurance
  shall  contain  a  provision of continuing liability notwithstanding any
  recovery under such policy.
    c. Conduct. 1. A special electrician shall be principally  engaged  in
  the  business of performing electrical work in or on buildings, premises
  or lots so authorized under the license.
    2. The holder of a  special  electrician's  license  shall  report  in
  writing any change in employment to the license board within thirty days
  of  the  change. If such change occurs prior to issuance of the license,
  an applicant shall  report  the  change  to  the  license  board  within
  fourteen days of the change.
    3.   Applications   for  permits  and  any  other  document  that  the
  commissioner may require to be filed with the department, shall bear the
  stamp of the special electrician's seal as well as the  signature  of  a
  person   holding   such  license.  Such  person  shall  personally  sign
  applications for permits and shall have  the  authority  to  make  final
  determinations  and full responsibility for the manner in which the work
  is done. For applications and other documents submitted  electronically,
  the  digital  signature  and  imprint  of the seal may be submitted in a
  manner authorized by the commissioner.
