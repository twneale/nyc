  power, signaling, communication, alarm and data transmission in the city
  subject to the amendments adopted by local law and set forth in  section
  27-3025  of  this subchapter, which shall be known and cited as "the New

  edition  of  the  National  Fire Protection Association NFPA 70 National
  Electrical Code with such New York city  amendments  shall  together  be
  known  and  cited  as  the  "electrical  code  technical standards". The

    b. No later than August thirty-first, two thousand twelve  and  on  or
  before  such date in every third year thereafter, the commissioner shall

  provisions  thereof.  In  addition,  prior  to  the  submission  of such
