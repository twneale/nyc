    (1) Primary Power Supply for the  Fire  Alarm  System.  Primary  power
  supply for the fire alarm system shall be connected to the primary power
  source  ahead  of  all  building service disconnecting means so that the
  building service disconnecting means can be opened without de-energizing
  the  fire  alarm  supply. All utility metering of the fire alarm system,
  including  disabling  or  removal  of  meters,  shall   maintain   power
  continuity to the fire alarm system at all times.
    (2)  Limited  Interior  Fire  Alarm  Systems. Primary power supply for
  sub-systems  or  other  limited  interior  fire  alarm  systems  may  be
  connected to the power supply through the protected area of such systems
  by  means of a connection ahead of the disconnecting means for the power
  supply to the protected area.
    FPN: Sub-systems and limited interior fire alarm systems may also  use
  the connected means defined in paragraph (1) where available.
    (B)  Secondary  Power  Source.  Where  an  emergency  power  system is
  provided or required to be provided for emergency system loads, the fire
  alarm  circuits  shall  be  provided  with  a  secondary  power  source.
  Batteries  shall not be a substitute for connection to a secondary power
  source.  The secondary power source shall comply with  the  requirements
  for emergency power systems and/or emergency generator that are used for
  emergency systems loads as articulated below:
    (1)  Generally.  Emergency  power systems complying with Chapter 27 of
  the 2008 Building Code shall be permitted to serve as a secondary  power
  source or
    (2)  Existing  Buildings.  Emergency  power  systems  and/or emergency
  generators in existing buildings in compliance with Title 27, chapter 1,
  subchapter 6, section 27-396.4 of the Administrative Code (also referred
  to as the 1968 Building  Code)  shall  be  permitted  to  serve  as  the
  secondary power source.
    The  secondary  power  supply  shall  be connected such that all other
  disconnecting means serving other building emergency loads can be opened
  without de-energizing the facility fire alarm secondary power supply.
    FPN: The use of a main  disconnecting  means  on  the  output  of  the
  generator(s)  is  permitted  where  the disconnection of all other loads
  does not interrupt  the  facility  fire  alarm  system  secondary  power
  supply.
    (C)  Battery.  Regardless  of whether a secondary power source is also
  provided, each fire alarm system and subsystem shall be equipped with  a
  storage   battery  power  supply  sized  to  meet  the  operating  power
  requirements of the system in accordance with (1), (2) or (3) below  and

  hours followed by full load operation for 6 hours for systems with voice
  communications capability.

  alarm system.
    (D)  Arrangement  of  Power  Sources.  One  source  of  power shall be
  connected to the fire  alarm  system  at  all  times.  The  primary  and
  secondary  power  sources  shall be arranged and controlled by automatic
  transfer switches dedicated to the  fire  alarm  system  such  that  the
  secondary  source  will  be  automatically  connected  to the fire alarm
  system should the primary power source fail.  The  following  conditions
  shall be observed:
    (1)  Intermediary  devices  between the fire alarm system power supply
  and the power source, other than fused disconnect switches, transformers
  and  automatic  transfer  switches  are  prohibited.   Such   disconnect
  switches, transformers and automatic transfer switches shall supply only
  the  fire  alarm  system  and  other  systems  specifically permitted by
  applicable New York City rules and regulations.
    (2) The primary and secondary power source shall each be provided with
  a means of disconnect from the fire alarm system. Each disconnect  shall

  personnel.   Such  disconnect  shall  be  painted  red  and  permanently
  identified as a fire alarm circuit and  labeled  as  to  system/location
  served,  with  a  means  of  interrupting  the  unfused grounded and all
  ungrounded conductors.
