Section 18-138

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  18-138  Locations  of  concessions  in parks. a. Except as provided
  herein, any concession under the jurisdiction of the  commissioner,  and
  any restaurant located within any park that is the subject of a lease or
  other  agreement between the department and a not-for-profit corporation
  relating to the restoration and maintenance of the park  in  which  such
  restaurant   is  located,  other  than  seasonal  concessions  of  under
  forty-five days in duration in a  calendar  year,  shall  have  specific
  boundaries  which  shall be indicated on a map of the park in which such
  concession or restaurant is located. No such  concession  or  restaurant
  shall extend beyond the boundaries indicated on such map. The department
  shall  visibly mark the authorized boundaries of each such concession or
  restaurant and shall maintain such markings, unless  all  boundaries  of
  such   concession  or  restaurant  are  within  a  building  or  similar
  stationary structure or marking a boundary is  not  practicable  because
  the  terrain  does  not  allow  for  such  marking. The department shall
  determine how such markings shall be made and any such marking shall  be
  consistent  with  any  law,  rule,  regulation  or  determination of the
  landmarks preservation commission and the public design commission. This
  subdivision shall not apply to any concession  authorized  to  occupy  a
  ground  space  of  less  than two hundred square feet, to occupy an area
  greater than two acres, or to operate in  locations  in  three  or  more
  boroughs,  nor  shall  this  subdivision apply to any concession that is
  expressly authorized to move its location pursuant to the terms  of  the
  applicable  concession  agreement.  The  location  of  a  concession  or
  restaurant subject to the provisions of this subdivision shall  also  be
  marked  on  a  map  of  the  park  or  parks in which such concession or
  restaurant is located which map shall be made available on the  city  of
  New  York's  website  within  one  year  of  the  effective date of this
  section.  However,  any  concession  or  restaurant  covered   by   this
  subdivision  where the concession agreement, lease or other agreement is
  entered into or renewed following the effective date  of  this  section,
  shall  have  such  maps  posted  within  sixty  days of the execution or
  renewal of the relevant concession or lease agreement. It shall not be a
  violation of this section where the moving of any such boundary was done
  pursuant to the direction of an authorized employee  of  any  applicable
  city agency.
    b.  Any  person  who  violates the provisions of subdivision a of this
  section by exceeding  the  authorized  boundaries  of  a  concession  or
  boundaries for the location of a restaurant subject to the provisions of
  this  section  shall  be liable for a civil penalty of not less than two
  hundred dollars nor  more  than  one  thousand  dollars  for  each  such
  violation.  Such  civil  penalty  shall  be  in  addition to any penalty
  imposed pursuant to a concession agreement with the department.
