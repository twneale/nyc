Section 18-107

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  18-107  Replacement  of trees. a. Any person that intends to remove
  any tree that is within the  jurisdiction  of  the  commissioner,  shall
  obtain a permit from the department prior to such removal.
    b.  The  department shall charge a fee for each permit issued pursuant
  to this section,  which  shall  be  sufficient  to  cover  the  cost  of
  replacing  any  tree  proposed  to  be removed. In applying for a permit
  pursuant to this section, a person shall  specify  whether  such  person
  intends to plant replacement trees as directed by the department or have
  the  department  plant replacement trees. If replacement trees are to be
  planted by the person  applying  for  the  permit  and  are  planted  as
  directed by the department, then the department shall return such fee to
  such  person  upon  completion of such planting. In all other cases, the
  department shall retain such fee for purposes  of  planting  replacement
  trees.
    c.  Upon  determining that a person may be issued a permit pursuant to
  this section, the department shall inform such person in writing of  the
  fee  required,  the  number  and  size  of  the  replacement trees to be
  planted, the method used in making these calculations, and the period of
  time prescribed by subdivision d or  f  of  this  section  during  which
  replacement  trees  shall be planted. Such information shall be provided
  to such person not more than ninety  days  following  the  filing  of  a
  completed application for such permit.
    d.  The  location  of replacement tree planting and the timing of such
  planting shall be as determined by the department horticultural officer,
  provided, however, that such replacement shall be made within sixty days
  after the project is completed or in the next  ensuing  spring  or  fall
  season  after  the  project  is  completed  or earlier as agreed by such
  person and the department. To the extent practicable, replacement  trees
  shall be planted within the same community district from which the trees
  that were the subject of the permit were removed.
    e.  The  department shall promulgate such rules as may be necessary to
  implement the provisions of this section, including but not  limited  to
  rules governing the fee to be paid to the department and any method used
  to calculate the number and size of the replacement trees required to be
  planted, provided that such replacement trees shall, at a minimum, equal
  one  caliper  inch  of  replacement  tree  for each caliper inch of tree
  removed. In promulgating such rules, the department shall  substantially
  comply  with  guidelines  set  forth  by  the  international  society of
  arboriculture.
    f. The provisions of this section shall apply to  all  city  agencies,
  including  the department, provided, however, that (i) no city agency or
  city contractor or subcontractor shall be required to pay a fee  to  the
  department,  (ii)  a tree site plan shall be developed by the department
  in consultation with the responsible city agency or  agencies  regarding
  the  location  of replacement trees prior to issuance of the permit, and
  (iii) replacement of trees by any city  agency  or  city  contractor  or
  subcontractor  shall be made not more than eighteen months from the date
  the project is completed.
