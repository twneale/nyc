Section 18-126

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  18-126  Hunter  Island  Marine  Zoology  and Geology Sanctuary. The
  commissioner shall set aside as a zoological and  geological  haven  and
  preserve,  the  section  of  park  lands  and  lands  under water in the
  northeastern portion of Pelham Bay park designated on the official  maps
  of  the  department  as  proposed  sanitation  land  fill area V broadly
  described as follows:
    Area V, an irregular N-shaped area of  marsh  lands  and  lands  under
  water  running from a point where the sand of Orchard beach terminate in
  Long Island sound at the extreme  northern  tip  of  the  beach,  thence
  northwesterly  to  the  eastern shore of Hunter island, thence northeast
  along the high water mark line of the eastern shore of Hunter island  to
  that  point of the island which still faces east into Long Island sound,
  thence in a wide arc going easterly and southerly, through the waters of
  Long Island sound, including within the arc the  islands  known  as  Cat
  Briars island or One Tree island, and Twin islands, back to the point of
  beginning.
    The  commissioner  may  enter  into  an  agreement  with  a  nonprofit
  organization for the operation and maintenance by such  organization  of
  the areas hereinabove referred to for the adequate keeping, maintenance,
  management,  operation  and  preservation  by  such  organization of the
  animals, aquatic animals, migratory and  resident  fowl  and  songbirds,
  fish and other glacial or post glacial flora and fauna indigenous to the
  area,  to  establish  collections  of  specimens  and provide interested
  individual nature lovers and educational institutions with opportunities
  for study and research in the areas. Upon the making of such  agreement,
  the  city  may annually, in its discretion, appropriate to the operating
  organization such sum as  it  may  determine  for  the  maintenance  and
  support  of  the  Hunter Island Marine Zoology and Geology Sanctuary and
  the activities of the operating organization  in  connection  therewith.
  The failure of the commissioner to enter into such an agreement shall in
  no way alter the status of the above described areas as a marine zoology
  and geology sanctuary.
