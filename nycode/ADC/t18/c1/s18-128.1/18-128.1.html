  or  other  not-for-profit  corporation  or  corporations,  or  a   local
  development  corporation  or  corporations,  or any combination thereof,
  their  successors  or  assigns  (individually  or  collectively,  herein
  referred  to  as "NPC") by contract, lease, license or other instrument,
  upon such terms and conditions as shall be agreed upon between the  city
  and  NPC,  the  right,  for  any  purpose  or  purposes  referred  to in
  subdivisions b and c of this section, to use, occupy, license, lease  or
  carry  on or cause to be carried on activities in or on the whole or any
  part of the tracts of land described in subdivision d of  this  section,
  including  the  buildings and other facilities thereon, which tracts are
  situated in the borough of Staten Island and are commonly known as  Snug
  Harbor.
    b.  Any  contract,  lease, license, or other instrument referred to in
  subdivision a of this section may authorize or grant to NPC the right to
  use, occupy, license, lease and carry on  or  cause  to  be  carried  on
  activities  in  or  on  the  whole  or  any  part  of the tracts of land
  described in subdivision d of this section for any purpose  or  purposes
  which  furnish,  foster  or promote for the benefit of the people of the
  city, cultural development, education, recreation, historic preservation
  of buildings  and  improvement  of  business  and  commerce,  including:
  theatrical,  musical,  artistic presentations and exhibitions; meetings,
  assemblages, conventions  and  conferences;  telecommunication  systems;
  events  of  civic,  community  and  general public interest; and general
  business or commercial purposes which aid the other purposes set out  in
  this  subdivision, provided, however, that nothing herein shall grant to
  NPC the right to conduct any business or commerce, or contract with  any
  other party for the same, unless such business or commerce is compatible
  with  and  conducted in conjunction with the use of Snug Harbor cultural
  center, as a multi-purpose cultural center, and  further  provided  that
  nothing   herein   shall   permit   the   erection   or  maintenance  of
  telecommunication  towers  or   other   above   ground   apparatus   for
  telecommunication  transmission  systems  on the grounds of Snug Harbor.
  Subject to the limitations set forth in subdivision c of  this  section,
  such  land  may be used for the purpose of providing residences and work
  spaces for artists affiliated with the NPC  for  the  duration  of  such
  affiliation.  It is hereby declared that all of the purposes referred to
  in this subdivision are for the  benefit  of  the  health,  welfare  and
  prosperity of the people of the city and are public purposes.
    c.  Except  as  hereinafter  provided, the tracts of land described in
  subdivision d of this section shall not be used, occupied,  licensed  or
  leased  for  the  purpose  of  housing. Such land may be used to provide
  residences for artists who are affiliated with the NPC and  who  through
  their  work,  exhibits,  lectures or writings contribute to the goals of
  the NPC. Artists shall only be entitled to occupy  such  residences  for
  the  duration  of  their  affiliation  with  the  NPC  and  any lease or
  occupancy permit of a dwelling unit to an artist shall specify that  the
  tenancy  or  occupancy  shall  terminate  upon  the  termination  of the
  artist's affiliation with the NPC. Notwithstanding any  other  provision
  of  law,  such  dwelling  units  shall  not  be subject to regulation or
  control  pursuant  to  the  emergency  housing  rent  control  act,  the
  emergency  tenant  protection  act of nineteen seventy-four or any local
  laws enacted pursuant thereto, the emergency housing rent  control  law,
  the  rent  stabilization law of nineteen hundred sixty-nine or any other

  law  which  confers  rights  of  occupancy  upon   tenants   which   are
  inconsistent  with  the  intent of this subdivision to permit the NPC to
  provide  residences  for  artists  only  for  the  duration   of   their
  affiliation with the NPC.
    The  provisions of this subdivision shall not be construed to prohibit
  the NPC from providing residential accommodations to persons employed by
  the NPC where  such  residence  is  necessary  for  the  maintenance  or
  protection  of  the property such as a resident caretaker, supervisor of
  maintenance or supervisor of security.
