Section 18-137

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 18-137 Representation on park conservancies. a. For purposes of this
  section, the following terms shall have the following meanings:
    1.  "Conservancy"  shall  mean any not-for-profit entity that operates
  any  park  or  portion  of  any  park  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the
  commissioner,  pursuant  to  a written conservancy arrangement, provided
  that "conservancy" shall not  include  any  not-for-profit  entity  that
  operates in three or more boroughs.
    2.  "Conservancy  arrangement" shall mean any license or other written
  authorization allowing a conservancy to operate any park or  portion  of
  any park under the jurisdiction of the commissioner.
    3.  "Operates"  shall mean the ability to hire a majority of full time
  staff for such park.
    4. "Local representative" shall mean an individual who resides  within
  or whose place of business is located within a council district in which
  such park is located or which such park abuts.
    b.  Any  conservancy  arrangement  entered  into, renewed or otherwise
  granted or executed on or after the effective date of the local law that
  added this section shall require that at least one local  representative
  from each council district where such park is located or which such park
  abuts  be  a voting member of the board of directors, or other governing
  body  of  such  conservancy,  provided  that  no  more  than  one  local
  representative  from each council district in which such park is located
  and one local representative from two of  the  council  districts  which
  abut such park shall be required, and provided further that no more than
  twenty  percent  of  the  total  appointed or elected membership of such
  conservancy's board of  directors  or  other  governing  body  shall  be
  required  to  be local representatives. Such local representatives shall
  be designated in consultation with the council members representing  the
  districts  in  which  the  park  is located or which abut such park. The
  nature of such consultation  shall  be  determined  by  the  department,
  provided  that  the  department shall make the designation of each local
  representative  not  less  than  thirty  days  following   its   initial
  consultation  with the appropriate council member, during which time the
  council member may make a written  recommendation  regarding  the  local
  representative  to  be designated from their district. In the event that
  representation from council districts from which a local  representative
  may  be designated would in the aggregate be greater than twenty percent
  of the  total  appointed  membership  of  such  conservancy's  board  of
  directors  or  other  governing  body or there are more than two council
  districts abutting such park, the department may determine which council
  districts shall be  represented  initially,  in  consultation  with  the
  appropriate   council   members,   with   districts   from  which  local
  representatives shall be designated rotating thereafter in a  manner  to
  be determined by the department.
