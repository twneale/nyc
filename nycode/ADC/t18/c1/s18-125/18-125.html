Section 18-125

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  18-125  Thomas Pell Wildlife Refuge and Sanctuary. The commissioner
  shall set aside as a haven and preserve for wildlife, four  sections  of
  park  lands in the northwestern portion of Pelham Bay Park designated on
  the official maps of the  department  as  proposed  sanitation  landfill
  areas II, III, IV and VI, broadly described as follows:
    1.  Area  II,  an  irregularly-shaped  parcel bounded on the north and
  northeast by the Hutchinson river parkway and Rock uplands, on the  east
  by  the  Split Rock golf course, on the south by the New York, New Haven
  and Hartford railroad tracks and on the west by Bartow road, and running
  through the center thereof, a substantial portion of Goose creek.
    2. Area III, an irregularly-shaped parcel bounded on the north  by  an
  area  of  land  south of the Hutchinson parkway and the Bartow road exit
  from said parkway, on the east by a land area west of  Bartow  road,  on
  the south by the tracks of the New York, New Haven and Hartford railroad
  tracks  and  on the west by the center line of the Hutchinson river, but
  to include Goose island.
    3. Area IV, an irregularly-shaped parcel of land bounded on the  north
  by  the  New England thruway, on the east by the Hutchinson parkway, and
  on the south and on the west by the center line of the Hutchinson river.
    4. Area VI an irregularly-shaped parcel of land bounded on  the  north
  and  west  by the Hutchinson river, on the east and south by Shore road,
  said land being known as Tallapoosa west.
    Excluding, however, Tallapoosa east in said park lands which has  been
  designated as a landfill area for use by the department of sanitation.
    The  commissioner  may  enter  into  an  agreement  with  a  nonprofit
  organization for the operation and maintenance by such  organization  of
  the areas hereinabove referred to for the adequate keeping, maintenance,
  management,  operation  and  preservation  by  such  organization of the
  animals, aquatic animals, migratory and  resident  fowl  and  songbirds,
  fish  and  other  flora  and  fauna indigenous to the area, to establish
  collections of  specimens  and  provide  interested  nature  lovers  and
  educational  institutions  with  opportunities for study and research in
  the areas. Upon the making of such agreement, the city may annually,  in
  its  discretion,  appropriate  to the operating organization such sum or
  sums as it may determine for the maintenance and support of  the  Thomas
  Pell  Wildlife  Refuge and Sanctuary and the activities of the operating
  organization in connection therewith. The failure of the commissioner to
  enter into such an agreement shall in no way alter  the  status  of  the
  above-described areas as wildlife sanctuaries.
