Section 18-136.

    &sect;  18-136.  Advisory  committee  for  new  surfacing materials. a. For
  purposes of  this  section,  "surfacing  materials"  shall  mean  infill
  materials,  blades  of synthetic turf and surfaces used under and around
  play equipment.
    b.  The  department  shall  on  an  ongoing  basis  consult  with  the
  department  of  health  and  mental hygiene to identify and evaluate new
  surfacing  materials  that  have  not  been  previously  used  for   any
  playgrounds  or  athletic  fields by the department to determine whether
  such  materials  may  benefit  the  public  by  enhancing   recreational
  activities  and  to  evaluate  potential  health  or  safety impacts. In
  performing such an evaluation, the department  shall  assess  reasonably
  available  information  on  new surfacing materials to determine if such
  surfacing materials are appropriate for recreational activities in parks
  and meet existing  safety  and  health  standards,  including,  but  not
  limited  to  the  standards  of  the  American  society  for testing and
  materials, the American national standards  institute,  and  the  United
  States  consumer  products  safety  commission guidelines set out in its
  "Handbook for Public Playground Safety", applicable to  such  materials.
  Such evaluation shall also include an assessment of reasonably available
  information  regarding  whether  or  not  such materials may present any
  health or safety risk, including  whether  such  materials  retain  high
  levels  of  heat or contain hazardous levels of known carcinogens and/or
  toxic substances, and of any available studies of  such  materials  that
  address  environmental  issues.  Such  evaluation  shall also include an
  assessment  of  alternative  surfaces   and   technologies   considered,
  including  natural  surfacing.  The department shall use best efforts to
  locate all pertinent sources of information on any  surfacing  materials
  under  evaluation,  provided  that  nothing  in  this  section  shall be
  construed to require the performance of  an  exhaustive  search  of  all
  information  available  on  any  such  material. The department shall at
  least every six months provide to the advisory  committee  described  in
  this  section  a  report  regarding  any  evaluation  of  new  surfacing
  materials intended to be used by the department and prior to such use by
  the department, or provide to the advisory committee a written statement
  that no such report exists.
    c. (1) There shall be an advisory  committee  on  the  safety  of  new
  surfacing materials. The committee shall consist of nine voting members,
  five  of whom shall be appointed by the mayor, and four of whom shall be
  appointed by the speaker of the council. In addition,  the  commissioner
  of  the  department or a designee and the commissioner of the department
  of health and mental hygiene or a designee shall be non-voting  members.
  Each  member of the advisory committee shall serve without compensation.
  Members shall serve at the pleasure of the appointing official  and  any
  vacancy  shall be filled in the same manner as the original appointment.
  The committee shall have representatives with expertise drawn  from  the
  following  subject  areas:  American  society  for testing and materials
  testing methods, consumer products  safety  commission  guidelines,  the
  environmental  field,  the  science  field,  medicine  and human health,
  landscape  architecture  and  park  planning,  athletic  direction   and
  physical  exercise,  and  the  Americans with disabilities act. It shall
  also have at least one representative from user groups of playgrounds or
  athletic fields. The members shall choose a chairperson from  among  the
  voting  members. The advisory committee shall meet with the commissioner
  or a designee prior to July first and prior to January first  each  year
  at  which  time  the  commissioner or such designee shall respond to any
  recommendations made by such committee pursuant to paragraph 2  of  this
  subdivision.  The  location and time of such meeting shall be determined
  by  the  chairperson  in  coordination  with   the   commissioner.   The

  commissioner  may  also  schedule a meeting of the advisory committee on
  twenty calendar days notice to all members of the committee. Such notice
  to the members of the committee shall be  by  electronic  mail  and  via
  facsimile  as  available or via certified mail to the last known address
  of such member if neither electronic method nor facsimile is available.
    (2) The advisory committee shall evaluate any report provided to it by
  the department pursuant to subdivision b of this section.  The  advisory
  committee  may  at  any  time  make  independent  recommendations to the
  commissioner regarding proposed new surfacing materials, and may suggest
  means of educating the public about the  appropriate  and  safe  use  of
  materials.  The commissioner shall consider any recommendations received
  from the committee.
    d. Recommendations of the advisory committee pursuant to subdivision c
  of this section and reports required by subdivision b  of  this  section
  shall  be  sent to the mayor and the speaker of the council and shall be
  made available on the  department's  website  within  ten  days  of  the
  release of any such reports.
    e.  The  advisory  committee  shall  be  deemed  established  upon the
  appointment of its members and shall continue to exist until three years
  from the effective date of the local law that added this section,  after
  which  it  shall  cease to exist. Appointment of committee members shall
  occur within one hundred eighty days of the enactment of this section.
