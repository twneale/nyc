<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 18-135  Requiring  signage  warning  of  heat  dangers of playground
  equipment.  The  department  shall  place  at  all  entrances   to   all
  playgrounds  operated  by  or  under the jurisdiction of the department,
  including those for  which  the  department  has  an  agreement  with  a
  conservancy   or  other  not-for-profit  organization  with  respect  to
  operation of any aspect of a playground a sign reading,  "Warning:  Some
  surfaces may become hot. Please take precautions with exposed skin."
    Such  signs  shall be placed at all entrances of all playgrounds where
  presently there is not a sign at all entrances warning  that  shoes  are
  required  to be worn in such playground. Such signs shall also be placed
  at the entrances to all other playgrounds upon replacement of a sign  in
  any  such  playground  warning  that  shoes are required to be worn. All
  signs shall be securely affixed at such entrances. The  above  described
  warning shall also be placed on every sign in any playground stating the
  rules of such playground when any such sign is replaced. All signs shall
  be in English and, where appropriate, additional languages. For purposes
  of  this  section,  "securely  affixed" shall mean that at a minimum the
  signs shall be tethered to not less than two stationary fixtures.
