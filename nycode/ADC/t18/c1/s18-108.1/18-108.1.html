  charge and to the extent that any amount has been  previously  paid  for
  release  of  the  motorcycle,  all  terrain vehicle, snowmobile or motor

  snowmobile  or  motor  vehicle is registered pursuant to the vehicle and
  traffic law, such notice shall also be mailed to the  registered  owner.
