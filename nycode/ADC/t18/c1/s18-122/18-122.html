Section 18-122

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  18-122  Bicycle and tricycle areas in parks. a. Legislative intent.
  The city council hereby declares  that  a  drastically  high  number  of
  adults  and  children  are annually killed and injured by motor vehicles
  while operating bicycles and tricycles in the streets of  our  city  and
  countless pedestrians have been injured by the operation of bicycles and
  tricycles on sidewalks and pedestrian walks in parks.
    Although the riding of bicycles and tricycles is healthy and wholesome
  and  a  normal  activity  for  developing  youngsters,  the  streets and
  sidewalks of the city of New York are  highly  congested  and,  in  most
  areas, dangerous.
    The  safety  of  the children of New York city requires that a maximum
  number of off-street areas be developed for the  operation  of  bicycles
  and  tricycles  in local communities, and it is impossible to adequately
  meet this problem except by a large  centralized  riding  area  in  each
  borough.
    It  is  the  intent  of the council to assure the broad development of
  such a program by this legislation.
    b. Designation areas. 1. The commissioner shall cause  to  be  created
  and  maintained,  in  all  parks  whose  total  area exceeds five acres,
  adequate areas appropriately designed for the use  of  bicycles  and  of
  tricycles.
    2.  Such  areas  shall  be designed and constructed in accordance with
  plans and specifications approved by the commissioner.
    3. For purposes of this section,  the  word  "areas"  shall  mean  and
  include  "bicycle  paths"  at least one mile long in parks whose area is
  greater than twenty-five acres, "bicycle tracks" at least one-quarter of
  a mile long in  parks  whose  area  is  greater  than  five  acres,  and
  "tricycle circles" located close to adequate seating space for adults.
