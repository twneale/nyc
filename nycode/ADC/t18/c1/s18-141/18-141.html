Section 18-141

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  18-141  Native biodiversity planting practices. a. Increased native
  biodiversity. By November 1,  2013,  the  department  shall  revise  its
  design  manual to increase biodiversity in its landscape practices. Such
  practices shall maximize the use of native  plantings  and  drought  and
  salt  tolerant  plantings,  as appropriate, and minimize the presence of
  exotic monocultures on all city-owned property, including green streets,
  medians, sidewalks, parks and other areas where plantings  occur.  Where
  native  plant  species are not appropriate, such practices shall require
  the use of any plant species that has  not  been  determined  to  be  an
  invasive plant species by the New York state department of environmental
  conservation or by the department, or determined to be a noxious weed by
  the  New  York  state department of agriculture and markets. Such manual
  shall include:
    1. a native species planting guide, to be updated at least every  five
  years,  that lists the qualities of native species suitable for planting
  in the city of New York, including, but not limited to, the  appropriate
  hydrological  and  soil conditions, necessary sunlight, drought and salt
  water tolerance, coloring, shade cover, compatibility with other  plants
  and usefulness as a habitat; and
    2.  a  list of alternative native species for commonly used non-native
  species.
    b. The manual developed pursuant to this section shall  be  accessible
  for  use  by  property owners and professional land managers to increase
  biodiversity and the use of native species, and shall be made  available
  on-line  on the department's website. For purposes of this section only,
  "native species" shall mean, with respect to a particular  ecosystem,  a
  species  that,  other  than  as the result of introduction, historically
  occurred or currently occurs in that ecosystem.
    c. All plantings conducted by the department after May 1, 2014,  shall
  conform  to  the  design  manual promulgated or drafted pursuant to this
  section. Each calendar year from 2015 to 2019, inclusive, the department
  shall review the effectiveness of  the  use  of  its  design  manual  to
  increase  native  biodiversity  in  public  plantings  and shall issue a
  report to the mayor and the council documenting the number and  location
  of  all  native  species  plantings in the prior year, including efforts
  made by the department to utilize local genotypes, and a description  of
  the department's plans for increasing the diversity of native species in
  the city.
    d.  Exemption.  Botanic  gardens  and  public institutions who possess
  plants for educational, scientific, historic or collection purposes  and
  take  precautions  to  prevent  non-native species from going to seed or
  spreading  beyond  the  existing  planting  shall  be  exempt  from  the
  requirements of this section.
