Section 3-243.

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 3-243. Confidentiality of domestic partnership information. The city
  clerk  shall  establish  procedures  to  ensure  the  confidentiality of
  information in the registry of domestic partnerships.
    a. In the ordinary course of business, such records shall be  released
  only:
    1. To the parties to the domestic partnership;
    2.  To  individuals  presenting  written authorization from one of the
  parties to the domestic partnership;
    3. To attorneys in cases where such records are required  as  evidence
  in a legal proceeding.
    b.  The  following restrictions shall not apply to records that are at
  least fifty years old, or to records where both parties to the  domestic
  partnership are deceased:
    1.  Where  a  party to the domestic partnership sends a third party to
  obtain  their  domestic  partnership  record   without   a   letter   of
  authorization,  the  third  party  may  make  the  request  and  pay any
  applicable fee if the third party consents to having the  record  mailed
  directly  to the party to the domestic partnership. The record shall not
  be released directly to the unauthorized third party.
    2. If a person requires information concerning the  prior  history  of
  domestic  partnerships of a person who is that person's domestic partner
  or spouse or prospective domestic partner or spouse, the office  of  the
  City  Clerk  shall, upon receiving adequate assurance that such person's
  interest is as described in this paragraph, payment of  the  appropriate
  fee,  and  the  furnishing of an approximate date of the registration of
  the partnership and sufficient information to search under at least  one
  party's name, confirm only the fact of a prior domestic partnership by a
  "yes" or "no" answer.
    c.  Nothing  herein  shall be construed to prohibit the publication of
  statistics  pertaining  to  domestic  partnerships   which   have   been
  registered  by  the  city  clerk, provided that appropriate measures are
  taken to prevent identification of persons registered.
