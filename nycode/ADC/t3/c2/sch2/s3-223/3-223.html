  of any statement or report required  by  this  subchapter,  which  shall
  conform  with  the  schedule established by the New York Temporary State
  Commission on Lobbying, or any  successor  thereto,  for  such  charges.
  Following  a  failure to make and file any such statement or report, the
  city clerk shall notify the person  or  organization  of  such  fact  by
  certified  mail  that  such filing must be made within fourteen business
  days of the date of mailing of such notice.  The  failure  to  file  any

  For  the  purposes of this subdivision, the chief administrative officer
  of any organization required to file a statement or report shall be  the
  person responsible for making and filing such statement or report unless
  some other person prior to the due date thereof has been duly designated
  to make and file such statement or report.
    * NB Effective until May 16, 2014
    * (c) (1) Following a failure to make and file any statement or report
  required  by  this subchapter, the city clerk shall notify the person or
  organization of such fact by certified mail that  such  filing  must  be
  made  within  fourteen  business  days  of  the  date of mailing of such
  notice. The failure to file any statement or  report  within  such  time
  shall  constitute  a  class  A misdemeanor. In addition to such criminal
  penalties, such person or organization  shall  be  subject  to  a  civil
  penalty,  in  an  amount  not  to  exceed twenty thousand dollars, to be
  assessed by the city clerk. For the purposes of  this  subdivision,  the
  chief  administrative  officer  of  any  organization required to file a
  statement or report shall be  the  person  responsible  for  making  and
  filing  such  statement  or report unless some other person prior to the

  due date thereof  has  been  duly  designated  to  make  and  file  such
  statement or report.
    (2)  Any lobbyist or client who has never previously filed a statement
  of registration or any other report required by this subchapter shall be
  charged a late filing penalty of ten dollars for  each  day  a  required
  statement  or  report  is  late. If more than one statement or report is
  late, the total late filing penalty shall be equal to  the  sum  of  ten
  dollars  per  day  multiplied  by  the number of such late statements or
  reports. Any other lobbyist or client shall be  charged  a  late  filing
  penalty  of  twenty-five  dollars  for  each day a required statement or
  report is late. If more than one statement or report is late, the  total
  late filing penalty shall be equal to the sum of twenty-five dollars per
  day  multiplied  by  the number of such late statements or reports. Late
  filing penalties may be waived or reduced at the discretion of the  city
  clerk. A lobbyist or client seeking a waiver or reduction of late filing
  penalties  shall  submit  documentation as required by the city clerk. A
  decision to grant such a waiver or reduction shall be made in writing by
  the city clerk. The city clerk shall take  the  following  factors  into
  account in determining whether a waiver or reduction is appropriate:
    (i) whether and how often the lobbyist or client has filed late in the
  past;
    (ii) the annual operating budget of the lobbyist or client;
    (iii) whether the lobbyist lobbies solely on its own behalf;
    (iv)  for  periodic reports, the number of lobbying matters, number of
  hours spent working on those matters, and  amount  of  compensation  and
  expenditures that were not reported during the relevant period; and
    (v)  the significance of the impediments to timely filing faced by the
  lobbyist or client.

  section shall be subject to a civil penalty, in an amount not to  exceed
  twenty thousand dollars, to be assessed by the city clerk.
    (e)  Any  civil  penalty  to be assessed under subdivision (d) of this
  section, or any order issued under subdivision (a) of this section,  may
  only  be  imposed  or  issued  after written notice of violation and the
  expiration of fourteen business days from the date of  mailing  of  such
  notice. If such violation is cured within such fourteen-day period, then

    (f)  The  amount  of  any  assessment made or duration of order issued
  pursuant to this section shall be determined only  after  a  hearing  at

  corporation counsel.
    (g) The city clerk shall be charged with the  duty  of  reviewing  all
  statements  and  reports  required under this subchapter for violations,
  and it shall be his duty, if he deems such to be wilful, to report  such
  determination  to  the department of investigation. Where the city clerk
  receives a report or otherwise suspects that  a  criminal  violation  of
  law,  other  than  a  violation of this subchapter, has been or may have
  been committed, the city clerk shall  report  any  information  relating
  thereto to the department of investigation.
    (h)  The  department  of investigation shall provide assistance to the
  city clerk for the purpose of training personnel who are responsible for
  the administration and enforcement of the provisions of this subchapter.
  The city clerk shall  develop  compliance  programs  for  lobbyists  and
  clients.

    * (i)(1) The city clerk shall by rule establish an amnesty program for
  any  lobbyist  who  was  required  to have filed, but has never filed, a
  statement of registration pursuant to section 3-213 of this  subchapter,
  or  any  client  who was required to have filed, but has never filed, an
  annual  report pursuant to section 3-217 of this subchapter, at any time
  on or after December tenth, two thousand six.
    (2) Any lobbyist or client intending to  participate  in  the  amnesty
  program may file a written notice of intent to participate with the city
  clerk  on  forms  prescribed  by the city clerk, stating his, her or its
  intention to participate in such program,  at  any  time  prior  to  the
  effective  date  of the amnesty program. The city clerk shall not assess
  any late filing penalties or any  civil  penalties  authorized  by  this
  section  that  could be assessed against any such lobbyist or client for
  the period from December tenth, two thousand six  to  the  date  of  the
  filing  of  such notice. Any lobbyist or client filing a notice pursuant
  to this paragraph shall comply with all applicable  provisions  of  this
  subchapter beginning on the day of such filing.
    (3)  Any  lobbyist  or  client intending to participate in the amnesty
  program, including any  lobbyist  or  client  who  has  filed  a  notice
  pursuant  to  paragraph  two  of  this subdivision, shall file a written
  application on forms prescribed by  the  city  clerk  on  or  after  the
  effective  date  of  the amnesty program, but prior to the expiration of
  such program. Such application shall include a summary, which shall meet
  the  requirements  of  the  city  clerk,  of  the  lobbying  activities,
  fundraising  activities  or political consulting activities performed by
  such lobbyist or received by such client from  one  year  prior  to  the
  effective date of the amnesty program until the date of such application
  or  valid  filing  pursuant  to  paragraph two of this subdivision. Such
  amnesty program shall provide that upon the filing of  such  application
  and  upon  compliance with all applicable provisions of this subchapter,
  the city clerk shall waive any  late  filing  penalties  and  any  civil
  penalties  authorized by this section that could be assessed against any
  such lobbyist or client for the period from December tenth, two thousand
  six to the date of the filing of such application or, if the lobbyist or
  client  made  a  valid  filing  pursuant  to  paragraph  two   of   this
  subdivision,  to the date of such filing. In addition, any such lobbyist
  or client shall not be subject to any criminal penalties  authorized  by
  this section for the period from December tenth, two thousand six to the
  date  of  the  filing  of such application or, if the lobbyist or client
  made a valid filing pursuant to paragraph two of  this  subdivision,  to
  the date of such filing.
    (4)  The  term  of  the  amnesty  program established pursuant to this
  subdivision by rule of the city clerk shall not exceed six months, after
  which no application  for  amnesty  shall  be  accepted.  Prior  to  the
  commencement  of,  and during the term of, the amnesty program, the city
  clerk shall publicize the amnesty  program  so  as  to  maximize  public
  awareness  of  and  participation  in such program. The city clerk shall
  consult with city agencies and the city council to develop  notices  and
  advertisements  to  be  placed  in  print  and electronic media that are
  intended to reach persons and  organizations  doing  business  with  the
  city.
    (5) Notwithstanding any provision of this subdivision to the contrary,
  any  lobbyist or client who is the subject of any criminal investigation
  relating to any violation of this subchapter and any lobbyist or  client
  who  is a party to any criminal litigation in any court of this state or
  the United States relating to any violation of this subchapter shall  be
  ineligible  to  file  the  notice  pursuant  to  paragraph  two  of this
  subdivision or the application  pursuant  to  paragraph  three  of  this

  subdivision  or  to otherwise receive relief from late filing penalties,
  or civil or criminal penalties under  the  amnesty  program  established
  pursuant to this subdivision.
    (6)  The  city  clerk  shall  promulgate  such  rules, issue forms and
  instructions, and take any and all other actions necessary to  implement
  the provisions of this subdivision.
