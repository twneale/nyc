  may  issue  a  certificate  to  that effect, within sixty days after the
  grading shall have been completed and accepted by the  appropriate  city
  agency  in  charge of the work. Such certificate shall be transmitted to
  the comptroller, together with a plan and profile of the portion of  the
  street  affected by such special grade. Upon such plan and profile there
