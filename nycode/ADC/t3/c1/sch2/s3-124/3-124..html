Section 3-124.

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 3-124. Study and report on the effects of wind on certain buildings.
  a.  The  office of long-term planning and sustainability in consultation
  with the department of buildings shall undertake a study  and  submit  a
  report  to the mayor and the speaker of the city council, on the effects
  of wind on existing buildings, including  existing  buildings  that  are
  raised,  and  buildings  that  are under construction in the city of New
  York. Such report and accompanying recommendations shall be provided  no
  later than two years from the effective date of the local law that added
  this section and shall include the following:
    1.  An  analysis to determine the types of existing buildings that are
  at risk of causing  falling  debris,  based  on  the  age,  construction
  classification,   construction   methods   and  materials,  height,  and
  occupancy use of such buildings;
    2. An analysis of the effects of wind on existing buildings  that  are
  raised,  lifted, elevated or moved in order to comply with Appendix G of
  the New York city building code or to address flood hazard concerns;
    3. An analysis of the effects of wind  on  buildings  that  are  under
  construction, including the effects of wind on buildings with incomplete
  facade  assemblies,  temporary  installations  used in construction, and
  construction materials that are stored on construction sites;
    4. An analysis of  forecasts  related  to  potential  changes  in  the
  frequency,  intensity,  and  path  of  future  storm  events  along with
  consideration of whether climate change may impact wind speeds; and
    5. An examination  of  the  benefits  of  installing  and  maintaining
  weather  stations  across the city, including on high-rise buildings, to
  better understand localized wind patterns.
    b. The report shall include recommendations on paragraphs one  through
  five  of  subdivision  a  of  this section as well as recommendations on
  whether the applicable wind loads under the city's building code  should
  be  revised;  whether standard wind plans for sites in various stages of
  construction  are  needed,  including  plans  regarding  equipment   and
  temporary  structures  such  as  cranes,  derricks,  scaffolds, concrete
  formwork and sidewalk bridges; how equipment  and  temporary  structures
  such  as  cranes,  derricks,  scaffolds,  concrete formwork and sidewalk
  bridges should be designed and secured in light of wind effects; whether
  changes to the building code or department of buildings rules related to
  facade work  filing  and  inspection  exemptions  or  safety  inspection
  requirements  are  necessary  and  what wind load requirements should be
  applied to existing buildings.
