    &sect;  3-103 Apprehension and conviction of criminals. The mayor, whenever
  he or she shall deem it necessary, may issue a proclamation  offering  a
  reward   for  information  which  shall  lead  to  the  apprehension  or
  apprehension and conviction of any person who may have committed a crime
  within the city. In such proclamation, the mayor may offer a reward  not
  exceeding  five  hundred dollars for the apprehension of any such person
  and  not  exceeding  ten  thousand  dollars  for  the  apprehension  and
  conviction  of  any  such  person, provided, however, that the mayor may
  offer a reward not  exceeding  one  hundred  thousand  dollars  for  the
  apprehension  and  conviction  of  any person found guilty in connection
  with an act of terrorism involving loss of life or substantial injury to
  persons or property. Any such reward shall  be  paid  out  of  the  city
  treasury  upon  a certificate of the mayor that the service required has
  been  performed.  For  purposes  of  this  section,  "terrorism"   means
  premeditated,   politically   motivated   violence  perpetrated  against
  noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents.
