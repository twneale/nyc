Section 3-401

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  3-401 Awards to spouses of killed firefighters, police officers and
  transit police officers. The mayor is authorized and empowered  to  make
  an  award to the spouse or domestic partner of a member of the uniformed
  force of the police department, fire  department  or  uniformed  transit
  police  force, maintained by the New York city transit authority, killed
  while engaged in the discharge of  duty.  Such  award  shall  equal  the
  annual  salary  of such member at the time of death, but in no case less
  than  the  full  salary  payable  to  a  first  grade  police   officer,
  firefighter  or  transit  police  officer  at  the date of death of such
  employee.
    In case there shall be no spouse or domestic  partner  surviving  such
  member, the award shall be made to the minor child or children surviving
  such  member.  In  case there shall be no spouse or domestic partner nor
  child nor children so surviving the award may be made to  the  dependent
  mother,  father, or other dependents of such member. Such award shall be
  made in one payment as soon after the death of such  member  as  may  be
  possible  and  shall  be  in  addition  to  any  pension, award or other
  allowances authorized by law.
    Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, and solely
  for the purposes of this section, a member  otherwise  covered  by  this
  section  shall  be  deemed  to  have  been  killed  while engaged in the
  discharge of duty upon which his or her membership  is  based,  provided
  that  such member was in active service upon which his or her membership
  is based at the time  that  such  member  was  ordered  to  active  duty
  pursuant to Title 10 of the United States Code, with the armed forces of
  the  United  States  or to service in the uniformed services pursuant to
  Chapter 43 of Title 38 of the United States Code, and such  member  died
  while  on  such  active  duty or service in the uniformed services on or
  after June fourteenth, two thousand five while serving  on  such  active
  military duty or in the uniformed services.
