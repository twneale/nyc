    &sect;  3-404  Awards  to  spouses  and  domestic  partners  of officers or
  employees of the city. The mayor is hereby empowered to make an award to
  the spouse or domestic partner of any officer or employee  of  the  city
  who  was  heretofore  or  shall hereafter be killed while engaged in the
  discharge of duty and who, at the time of death, was not  or  shall  not
  have  been a member of a retirement system or pension fund maintained by
  the city or supported in whole or in part  by  city  funds.  Such  award
  shall equal the annual compensation earnable by such officer or employee
  as  provided  by law or in the budget for the fiscal year in which death
  occurs.
    In case there shall be no spouse or  domestic  partner  surviving  the
  decedent, the award shall be made to the minor child or children of such
  decedent.  In  case there shall be no spouse, domestic partner, or child
  or children so surviving, the award  shall  be  made  to  the  dependent
  mother,  father,  or other dependents of such decedent. Such award shall
  be paid in one payment as soon  after  the  death  of  such  officer  or
  employee as may be possible.
