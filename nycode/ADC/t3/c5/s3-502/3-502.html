    &sect;  3-502 Permits. In all cases where provision is made by law that the
  consent of a borough president shall be obtained to authorize any act to
  be done, he  or  she  may  grant  a  permit  therefor,  subject  to  the
  restrictions  of  all  laws  in relation thereto. Upon granting any such
  permit, the borough president may exact such cash deposit  or  bond,  or
  both,  as he or she may deem necessary to safeguard the interests of the
  city.
