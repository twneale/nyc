Section 3-506

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  3-506  Borough presidents to adjust numbering. In all cases where a
  street shall have been numbered or  renumbered,  the  borough  president
  having  jurisdiction shall thereafter adjust and renumber such street as
  the same may be required from time to time. In numbering and renumbering
  houses, the borough president shall leave  sufficient  numbers  on  each
  block,  so  that,  under any circumstances, there would be but one block
  where a change  would  be  required,  in  case  of  renumbering  at  any
  subsequent time.
