    &sect;  20-959 Revocation or suspension of license, certificate of approval
  or registration. a. In addition to the  penalties  provided  in  section
  20-960 of this chapter, the commission may, after notice and opportunity
  to  be  heard,  revoke  or suspend a license, certificate of approval or
  registration issued pursuant to the provisions of this chapter when  the
  licensee  or a principal, employee or agent of a licensee, a holder of a
  certificate of approval or a registrant: (i) has been  found  to  be  in
  violation  of  this chapter or any rules promulgated hereunder; (ii) has
  repeatedly failed to obey the lawful orders of any person authorized  to
  enforce  the provisions of this chapter; (iii) has failed to pay, within
  the time specified by a  court,  the  commission  or  an  administrative
  tribunal of competent jurisdiction, any fines or civil penalties imposed
  pursuant  to this chapter or the rules promulgated pursuant hereto; (iv)
  whenever, in relation to an investigation  conducted  pursuant  to  this
  chapter,  the  commission determines, after consideration of the factors
  set forth in subdivision a of section 20-956 of this chapter,  that  the
  licensee,  holder  of a certificate of approval or registrant lacks good
  character, honesty and integrity or  lacks  the  financial  capacity  to
  maintain  and  operate  the  business  responsibly in a manner that will
  ensure  the  immediate  payment  to  patrons;  (v)  whenever  there  has
  knowingly  been  any  false  statement  or any misrepresentation as to a
  material fact in the application or accompanying papers upon  which  the
  issuance  of  such  license, certificate of approval or registration was
  based; or (vi) whenever a licensee has failed to notify  the  commission
  as  required  by  subdivision c of section 20-954 of this chapter of any
  change in the ownership interest of the business or any  other  material
  change  in the information required on the application for such license,
  or of the arrest or criminal conviction of a principal of such  licensee
  or any of its employees or agents of which the licensee had knowledge or
  should have known.
    b.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this  chapter or rules
  promulgated thereto, the commission may, upon a determination  that  the
  operation of a shipboard gambling business or the conduct of an employee
  of  such  business  creates  an  imminent  danger  to  life or property,
  immediately suspend the license of such business or the  certificate  of
  approval  or  registration  of  such  employee  without a prior hearing,
  provided that provision shall be made for an immediate  appeal  of  such
  suspension  to  the  chair  of  the  commission who shall determine such
  appeal forthwith. In the event that the chair upholds the suspension, an
  opportunity for a hearing shall  be  provided  on  an  expedited  basis,
  within  a  period  not  to  exceed four business days and the commission
  shall issue a final determination no later than four days following  the
  conclusion of such hearing.
