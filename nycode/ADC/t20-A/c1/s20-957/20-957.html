  a shipboard gambling license that the licensee  enter  into  a  contract
  with  an  independent  auditor,  approved or selected by the commission.
  Such contract, the cost of which shall be paid by  the  licensee,  shall
  provide that the auditor investigate the activities of the licensee with
  respect  to  the  licensee's  compliance  with  the  provisions  of this
  chapter, other applicable federal, state and local laws and  such  other
  matters  as  the  commission shall determine by rule. The contract shall
  provide further that the auditor report the findings of such  monitoring
  and investigation to the commission on a periodic basis.
    b.  The  commission  shall be authorized to prescribe, in any contract
  required by the commission pursuant to  this  section,  such  reasonable
  terms and conditions as the commission deems necessary to effectuate the
