  of time not to exceed five  years  to  be  determined  by  rule  of  the
  commission,  provided,  however,  that  such  rule  may provide that the
  commission may, in its discretion, require that records be retained  for
  a  period  of  time  exceeding  five  years.  Such records shall be made
  available for inspection and audit by the commission at its request and,
  at the option of the commission,  at  either  the  licensee's  place  of

  persons under eighteen years of age do not engage in gambling  aboard  a
  vessel operated by or on behalf of such licensee.

  permanent access by any person assigned to  such  vessel  by  an  agency
  authorized to enforce the provisions of this chapter.
    j.  A shipboard gambling licensee shall not purchase goods or services
  from a key vendor or an auxiliary vendor unless such  vendor  has  first
  obtained  a license from or registered with the commission, whichever is
  applicable,  unless  the  shipboard  gambling  licensee   has   obtained
  permission  from  the  commission  as provided by rule of the commission

  vendor  or  auxiliary  vendor has been granted a waiver pursuant to such
  subdivision.

  pursuant to the provisions  of  this  chapter  unless  such  person  has
  obtained   such   license,  certificate  of  approval  or  registration;
  provided, however, that the commission shall, by  rule,  make  provision
  for  temporary  permission  for  employment  pending  completion  by the
  commission of review of an applicant for a certificate  of  approval  or
  registration  and may, in its discretion, permit the employment of a key
  employee who has not obtained the required license where the  employment
  of  such person is necessary for the operation of the shipboard gambling
  business.
    (ii) The commission may, upon the  request  of  a  shipboard  gambling
  business, make available the names of applicants for employment who have
  been approved for licenses, certificates of approval or registrations.
    l. A shipboard gambling licensee shall demonstrate and ensure for each
  vessel  operated  by  or on behalf of such licensee, irrespective of the
  size of  the  vessel,  that  (i)  every  crew  member  required  by  the

  those required to be licensed by the United States coast  guard  or  the
  international  maritime  organization, have merchant mariners' documents
  endorsed for a rating of at  least  able  seaman  or  the  international
  maritime equivalent, and (iii) every person employed on each such vessel
  has  received  familiarization  training  consistent  with the standards
  regarding emergency  occupational  safety,  medical  care  and  survival
  functions  set  forth  in  the  seafarer's  training,  certification and
  watchkeeping code.
    m. A shipboard gambling licensee  shall  comply  with  all  additional
  rules  governing conduct of a shipboard gambling business promulgated by
  the commission in order to effectuate the purposes of this chapter.
