    I. "Principal" shall mean, of a sole proprietorship,  the  proprietor;

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this subdivision, where there  is
  reasonable  cause  to  believe  that any owner, officer or director of a
  business entity with an interest in an applicant business not  otherwise
  within  the  scope of this subdivision lacks good character, honesty and
  integrity, the commission may designate such person as a  principal  for

  business  for purposes of this chapter where the gambling cruises or the
  gambling activities aboard such cruises operated by or on behalf of such
  business  are  conducted  or  proposed  to be conducted no more than two
  times a year or every cruise operated  by  such  business  during  which
  gambling  activities  occur is of at least seventy-two hours duration or
  where the commission determines, in its discretion,  that  the  gambling
  offered  aboard  a  vessel  owned  or operated by such business does not
  constitute a primary activity conducted aboard such vessel. In  reaching
  a  determination  that  gambling does not constitute a primary activity,
  the commission shall consider, without  limitation,  factors  including:
  the passenger capacity of the vessel in relation to the number of gaming
  positions  in  the areas in which gambling will occur; the percentage of
  space devoted to public accommodation in which gambling will occur;  the
  number of hours during which gambling will take place in relation to the
  total  time  of  the cruise; and the nature of the advertising and other
  customer solicitation engaged in by the business.
    p. "Subsidiary" shall mean any business that  is  managed  by  another
  business  entity  or  any business in which fifty percent or more of the
  business is owned or in which fifty percent or more of the  business  is

  "Key vendor" shall mean a vendor, in a category identified  by  rule  of
  the commission, that furnishes goods or services related to the security
  operations,   gambling   operations,  gambling  equipment,  the  hiring,
  supervision or training of gambling employees or agents,  the  provision
  of  alcoholic  beverages, and the provision of food or food services the
  cost of which exceeds  an  amount  to  be  set  forth  by  rule  of  the
  commission.  "Auxiliary  vendor"  shall  mean a vendor, other than a key
  vendor, that  furnishes  goods  or  services  to  a  shipboard  gambling
  business,  the  cost  of which goods or services exceeds an amount to be
  established for each category of such vendor by rule of the  commission,
  related  to  maintenance of a vessel or facilities or equipment aboard a
  vessel, food or non-alcoholic beverages,  entertainment  or  such  other
  activity  for  which the commission determines by rule that registration
  is necessary  or  appropriate  to  effectuate  the  provisions  of  this
  chapter,  provided  that  the  commission  may  by  rule  determine that
  registration of a specific category of auxiliary vendor  is  unnecessary
  to  achieve  the  purposes of this chapter. The commission shall by rule
  list the categories of goods and services and/or the amount of sales  of
  such  goods  and  services  that  do  not require obtaining a key vendor
  license or an  auxiliary  vendor  registration  and  may  also,  in  its
  discretion,  waive  a  requirement for a key vendor license or auxiliary
  vendor  registration  upon  a  determination  that   such   license   or
  registration  is unnecessary to achieve the purposes of this chapter. In
  addition, the commission shall establish, by rule, a procedure whereby a
  shipboard gambling business  may  obtain  temporary  permission,  on  an
  expedited  basis,  to  purchase  goods or services from an unlicensed or
  unregistered vendor in a situation where such purchase is  necessary  to
  the  operation of such business. The commission shall make provision for
  the issuance of licenses pursuant to sections 20-954 and 20-956 of  this
  chapter  to  key  vendors  who  furnish  goods  or services to shipboard

  gambling licensees and for the registration pursuant to  section  20-955
  of auxiliary vendors who furnish goods or services to shipboard gambling
  licensees.  The  commission  shall  maintain  a list of all licensed and
  registered  vendors  and those vendors to whom a waiver has been granted
  and shall make such list available upon request.
