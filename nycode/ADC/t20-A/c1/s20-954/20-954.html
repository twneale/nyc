  of this subdivision, an applicant for a certificate  of  approval  shall
  not be required to submit information described in subparagraphs (a) and
  (m) of this paragraph or any other information the commission determines
  is  not  necessary  or  appropriate. An applicant may also submit to the
  commission any material or  explanation  which  the  applicant  believes
  demonstrates  that  any information submitted pursuant to this paragraph
  does not reflect adversely upon the applicant's good character,  honesty
  and  integrity.  The  commission may require that applicants pay fees to
  cover the  expenses  of  fingerprinting  and  background  investigations
  provided for in this subdivision.
    iii.  In the case of a shipboard gambling business, the commission may
  also require that an applicant submit any  or  all  of  the  information
  required  by  this paragraph with respect to any affiliate or subsidiary
  of the applicant that owns or operates a business in any jurisdiction.
    iv. Notwithstanding any provision of this  chapter,  for  purposes  of
  this  section  in  the  case of an applicant shipboard gambling business
  that has a parent business entity:  (A)  fingerprinting  and  disclosure
  under  this  section  shall  be  required of any person acting for or on
  behalf of the parent business who has direct management  or  supervisory
  responsibility  for  the operations or performance of the applicant; (B)
  the chief executive officer, chief operating officer and chief financial
  officer, or any other person exercising comparable responsibilities  and
  functions, of any subsidiary or affiliate of such parent business entity
  over  which  any  person  subject to fingerprinting and disclosure under
  subparagraph (A) of this paragraph  exercises  similar  responsibilities
  shall  be  fingerprinted  and  shall  submit  the  information  required

  pursuant  to  subparagraphs  (f)  and  (g)  of  paragraph  ii  of   this
  subdivision,  as  well  as  such additional information pursuant to this
  paragraph as the commission may find  necessary;  and  (C)  the  listing
  specified  under  subparagraph  (i)  of paragraph ii of this subdivision
  shall also be provided for any subsidiary or  affiliate  of  the  parent
  business  entity  for  which fingerprinting and disclosure by principals
  thereof is made pursuant to (B) of this paragraph.
    v. The chief executive officer,  chief  operating  officer  and  chief
  financial   officer,   or   any   other   person  exercising  comparable
  responsibilities and functions, of any  subsidiary  or  affiliate  of  a
  shipboard  gambling business shall be fingerprinted and shall submit the
  information required pursuant to  subparagraphs  (f),  (g)  and  (i)  of
  paragraph  ii  of  this  subdivision,  as well as such other information
  pursuant to this paragraph that the commission may find necessary.
    c. A business required to be licensed pursuant to this  chapter  shall
  inform  the  commission, within a reasonable time, of any changes in the
  ownership composition of such business, the addition or deletion of  any
  principal  at  any  time  subsequent to the issuance of the license, the
  arrest or criminal conviction of any principal of the business,  or  any
  other  material  change  in the information submitted on the application
  for a license. A business required to  be  licensed  shall  provide  the
  commission  with  notice  of  at least ten business days of the proposed
  addition of a new principal to such business. The commission  may  waive
  or  shorten  such  period  upon  a showing that there exists a bona fide
  business requirement therefor. Except where  the  commission  determines
  within  such  period,  based  upon information available to it, that the
  addition of such new  principal  may  have  a  result  inimical  to  the
  purposes  of  this  chapter,  the  licensee  may  add such new principal
  pending the completion of review by the commission. The  licensee  shall
  be  afforded  an  opportunity  to demonstrate to the commission that the
  addition of such new principal pending completion of such  review  would
  not  have a result inimical to the purposes of this chapter. If upon the
  completion of such review, the commission determines that such principal
  has not demonstrated that he or she possesses  good  character,  honesty
  and integrity, the license shall cease to be valid unless such principal
  divests  his  or her interest, or discontinues his or her involvement in
  the business of such licensee, as the case may be, within  a  reasonable
  time period prescribed by the commission.
    d.  Each  applicant  business  shall  provide  the  commission  with a
  business address in New York city where notices  may  be  delivered  and
  legal  process  served  and shall designate a person of suitable age and
  discretion at such address who shall be an agent for service of process.
