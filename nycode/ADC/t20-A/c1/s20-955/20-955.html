    &sect;  20-955  Registration  application;  application  for renewal. a. An
  applicant for registration or renewal pursuant  to  this  chapter  shall
  submit  an  application  on  a  form  prescribed  by  the commission and
  containing such information as the commission determines will adequately
  identify and establish the background of such applicant. The  commission
  may  refuse to register or to renew the registration of an applicant who
  has knowingly failed to provide  the  information  and/or  documentation
  required  by  such form, or who has knowingly provided false information
  or documentation, required by  this  chapter  or  any  rule  promulgated
  pursuant hereto.
    b.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this  chapter: (i) the
  commission may, where there is  reasonable  cause  to  believe  that  an
  applicant  has  not  demonstrated  to  the  commission  that  he  or she
  possesses good character,  honesty  and  integrity,  require  that  such
  applicant be fingerprinted and provide to the commission the information
  set  forth in subdivisions a and b of section 20-954 of this chapter and
  may, after notice and the opportunity to be heard,  refuse  to  register
  such  applicant  for  the  reasons set forth in subdivision a of section
  20-956 of this chapter; and
    (ii) if at any time subsequent to  registration,  the  commission  has
  reasonable  cause  to  believe that the registrant lacks good character,
  honesty and integrity, the commission may require that  such  registrant
  be  fingerprinted  and  provide  the  background information required by
  subdivision b of section 20-954 of this chapter and  may,  after  notice
  and the opportunity to be heard, revoke the registration for the reasons
  set forth in subdivision a of section 20-956 of this chapter.
