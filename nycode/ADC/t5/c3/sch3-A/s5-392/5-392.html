<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  5-392  Payment  by  the city. The city shall, within three calendar
  months after the confirmation of the  report  of  the  commissioners  of
  appraisal, pay to the respective owners and bodies politic or corporate,
  mentioned or referred to in such report, in whose favor, any sum or sums
  of  money  shall  be  estimated  and reported by such commissioners, the
  respective sum  or  sums  so  estimated  and  reported  in  their  favor
  respectively,  with lawful interest thereon, from the date of filing the
  oath and certified  copies  thereof  as  by  this  subchapter  required,
  deducting  therefrom  all  sums  of  money  paid  on  account thereof as
  provided in section 5-386 of this subchapter.  In  case  of  neglect  or
  default  in  the  payment  of  the  same  within the time aforesaid, the
  respective person or persons or bodies politic  or  corporate  in  whose
  favor  the  same  shall  be  so  reported, his, her, or their executors,
  administrators or successors, at any time or  times,  after  application
  first made by him, her, or them, to the comptroller for payment thereof,
  may sue for and recover the same, with lawful interest as aforesaid, and
  the  costs  of suit in any proper form of action against the city in any
  court having cognizance thereof, and it shall be sufficient  to  declare
  generally  for  so much money due to the plaintiff or plaintiffs therein
  by virtue of this subchapter for real estate taken or affected  for  the
  purpose  herein  mentioned,  and  the report of such commissioners, with
  proof of the right and title of the plaintiff or plaintiffs to  the  sum
  or sums demanded shall be conclusive evidence in such suit or action.
