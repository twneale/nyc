    &sect;  5-391  Hearing on the report. The application for the confirmation,
  modification or rejection of the report shall be  made  to  the  supreme
  court  at  a special term thereof held in the judicial district in which
  the land or some part thereof is  situated.  Upon  the  hearing  of  the
  application  such  court may confirm or modify such report or may in its
  discretion order that the report or any portion thereof affecting one or
  more parcels be referred to the same commission, or a new commission for
  a new hearing, and make an order containing a recital of  the  substance
  of  the  proceedings  in  the  matter  of  the  appraisal with a general
  description of the real estate appraised and for which  compensation  is
  to  be made; and shall also direct to whom the money is to be paid or in
  what bank or trust company and in what manner it shall be  deposited  by
  the  comptroller.  Such  order  confirming or modifying the report shall
  (except in case of an appeal, as provided in this subchapter)  be  final
  and  conclusive  as  well  upon  the city as upon owners and all persons
  interested in or entitled to such real estate; and also upon  all  other
  persons whomsoever.
