Section 5-401

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 5-401 Powers of the supreme court. The supreme court of the judicial
  district  in  which  the  real estate, or any part thereof, is situated,
  shall have power at any time to amend any defect or informality  in  any
  of  the  special  proceedings  authorized  by  this subchapter as may be
  necessary, or to cause other property to  be  included  therein  and  to
  direct  such  further  notice to be given to any party in interest as it
  deems proper, and also to appoint other commissioners in  place  of  any
  who shall die, or refuse or neglect to serve, or be incapable of serving
  or  be  removed.  Such  court  may  at  any  time  remove  any  of  such
  commissioners of appraisal who, in its judgment, shall be  incapable  of
  serving  or  who shall for any reason in its judgment be an unfit person
  to serve as such commissioner.  The  cause  of  such  removal  shall  be
  specified in the order making the same. If, in any particular, it shall,
  at  any time, be found necessary to amend any pleading or proceeding, or
  to supply any defect therein, arising  in  the  course  of  any  special
  proceeding  authorized  by this subchapter, the same may be corrected or
  supplied in such manner as may be directed by the supreme  court,  which
  is hereby authorized to make such amendment or correction.
