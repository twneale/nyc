Section 5-376

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  5-376  Determination of additional sources of water supply; reports
  to board of estimate. a. It shall be the duty  of  the  commissioner  of
  environmental  protection to proceed immediately and with all reasonable
  speed, to ascertain what sources exist and are most available, desirable
  and best for an additional supply of pure and wholesome  water  for  the
  city. The commissioner shall make such studies, investigations, surveys,
  maps,  plans,  profiles,  estimates  and reports as the commissioner may
  deem proper in order to ascertain the facts as to such sources and shall
  report to the board of estimate with recommendations as to  what  action
  should in the commissioner's opinion be taken with reference thereto. It
  shall be lawful for the board of estimate and the commissioner to report
  upon,  consider and determine the project in parts or sections from time
  to time as they may deem fit, so that the city may be able to obtain  an
  additional  supply  of  water  from one or more sources before the whole
  additional supply contemplated may be obtained.
    b. If at any time the board of  estimate  shall  determine  it  to  be
  advisable that the needs of the city with respect to its water supply or
  with  regard  to  the  delivery  of such supply to points convenient for
  distribution among the several boroughs shall be  made  the  subject  of
  study  and  investigation,  the commissioner of environmental protection
  shall forthwith  proceed  with  such  studies  and  investigations  and,
  together  with  his  or  her  recommendations,  report  to  the board of
  estimate. Upon receipt of any such report  the  board  of  estimate  may
  consider  and act upon it in the same manner and with the same authority
  as provided in this section and in any following sections.
