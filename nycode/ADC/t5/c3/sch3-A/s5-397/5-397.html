Section 5-397

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  5-397  Separate  reports by the commissioners. The commissioners of
  appraisal may, in their discretion,  take  up  any  specified  claim  or
  claims  and  finally ascertain and determine the compensation to be made
  thereon, and make a separate report with reference thereto, annexing  to
  such  report  a  copy  of  so much of the maps as displays the parcel or
  parcels so reported on. Such report as to the claims  therein  specified
  shall  be  the  report  required  in this subchapter, and the subsequent
  action with reference thereto shall be had in the same manner as  though
  no  other  claim were embraced in such proceeding, which, however, shall
  continue as to all claims upon which no such determination and report is
  made.
