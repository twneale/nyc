Section 5-394

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  5-394  Calendar  call after eighteen months; cessation of interest.
  Not less than eighteen months after the date of the filing of the  oaths
  of  any original commission appointed pursuant to the provisions of this
  subchapter, the corporation counsel may call a session of the commission
  appointed and acting as successor to such original  commission  for  the
  purpose  of  having  such successor commission fix dates for the hearing
  and presentation of any and all claims not theretofore disposed  of  and
  heard; such session shall be known as the calendar call.
    At  least ten days prior to such calendar call the corporation counsel
  shall give personal notice in writing to any or all  persons  interested
  in the proceeding and their attorneys, if any, that such a calendar call
  will  be  held  and  that  dates  will  be  fixed  for  the  hearing and
  presentation of claims. All persons  so  notified  may  appear  at  such
  calendar  call for the purpose of having dates fixed for the hearing and
  presentation of their claims. In the event that persons so notified fail
  to appear at such calendar call, the commission at the  request  of  the
  corporation  counsel shall fix dates for the hearing and presentation of
  their claims, which dates shall be not less than twenty days after  such
  calendar call. The corporation counsel shall further notify such persons
  in  writing of the dates thus fixed, which notice shall be so served not
  less than five days before the date so fixed.  All  persons  failing  to
  appear  on  the  dates fixed by the commission at such calendar call, or
  failing to give legal excuse for so failing to appear to the  commission
  at  or  before the time of such calendar call, shall forfeit their right
  to interest from and after the date  fixed  by  the  commission  at  the
  calendar call on any award made to them.
