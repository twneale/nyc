    &sect;  5-434  Acquisition of street being closed or discontinued. Whenever
  the closing or discontinuance of a street requires  the  acquisition  of
  the  fee title to the whole or any portion of the land within the street
  to be closed, the order of the mayor directing such acquisition shall:
    1. Approve three maps, prepared by the agency  requesting  the  street
  closing  and acquisition, showing the land in such closed street the fee
  title to which is to be acquired.
    2. Authorize and direct the corporation counsel to make application to
  the supreme court to have  such  court  without  a  jury  ascertain  and
  determine  the compensation which ought justly be made to the respective
  owners of the fee title to the land within such closed street.
    3. Specify the date upon which the city shall acquire fee title  which
  date  shall be the same as that specified in the resolution of the board
  of  estimate  as  the  date  upon  which  the  street  proposed  to   be
  discontinued or closed, shall become and be closed.
