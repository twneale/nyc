<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  5-445  Note  of issue of the proceeding. After all parties who have
  filed verified claims have proved their title, or have failed to  do  so
  after  being  notified  by the corporation counsel of the time and place
  when and where such proof of title would be received by the  corporation
  counsel,  such corporation counsel shall serve upon all parties or their
  attorneys who have appeared in the proceeding, a note of  issue  thereof
  and  shall  file  the  same with the clerk of the court of the county in
  which the trial is to be had. The trial shall  be  had  in  such  county
  within  the judicial district in which the real property affected by the
  proceeding is situated as the corporation counsel in the note  of  issue
  shall  designate.  Such  note of issue shall be served at least ten days
  before, and shall be filed at least eight days before the date for which
  the proceeding is noticed for trial. The note  of  issue  shall  briefly
  state:
    1. The title of the proceeding.
    2.  The  date  and entry of the order granting the application to have
  the compensation for damages  caused  by  the  closing  ascertained  and
  determined.
    3.  The  names and addresses of the parties who have filed claims, and
  the names and addresses of their respective attorneys.
    4. A brief statement as to the extent of the  street  which  has  been
  closed and discontinued and the part thereof to be acquired by the city.
  The  clerk  of  the  court  must thereupon enter the proceeding upon the
  proper calendar, according to  the  date  of  the  entry  of  the  order
  granting  such  application.  When the note of issue has been served and
  filed, the proceeding must remain on the calendar until finally disposed
  of.
