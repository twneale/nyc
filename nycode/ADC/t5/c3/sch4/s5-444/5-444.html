<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 5-444 Proof of ownership. a. The proof of title to real property for
  which damages caused by the closing of the street are claimed, and proof
  of  title to real property taken or damaged by reason of the acquisition
  by the city of the fee title to the land within the  closed  street,  in
  all  cases where the title thereto is undisputed, together with proof of
  liens, encumbrances or  burdens  thereon,  shall  be  submitted  by  the
  claimant  to  the  corporation  counsel,  or  to  such  assistant as the
  corporation counsel shall designate. The corporation counsel shall serve
  upon all parties or their attorneys who have served on  the  corporation
  counsel  a copy of their verified claims, a notice of the time and place
  at which he or she will receive such proof of title. In all cases  where
  the  title  of a claimant is disputed, it shall be the duty of the court
  to determine the ownership of  such  real  property,  or  the  right  to
  damages  thereto, upon the proof submitted to the court during the trial
  of the proceeding.
    b. The court shall also have power to determine all questions of title
  and right to damages, incident to the trial of the proceeding.
