Section 5-368

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  5-368  Tentative  decree; notice of motion to confirm; confirmation
  thereof. a. The corporation counsel, or in case of his or her neglect to
  do so within ten days after  receiving  notice  of  the  filing  of  the
  tentative  decree,  any person interested in the proceedings, shall give
  notice that such decree  will  be  presented  for  confirmation  to  the
  supreme  court,  at a time and place to be specified in such notice. The
  notice shall contain a statement of the time and place of the filing  of
  the decree, and shall be published in each of the newspapers referred to
  in  section  5-358  of  this subchapter, once in each week, for at least
  four weeks immediately prior to the  presentation  of  such  decree  for
  confirmation.
    b.  Upon  the hearing of the application for the confirmation thereof,
  such court shall confirm such decree in whole or in part  after  hearing
  any  objections  thereto  and  amending  the  same  if  proof  presented
  justifies such amendments. As to the whole or any portion of the  decree
  confirmed,  the  court  shall make an order, containing a recital of the
  substance of the proceedings in the  matter  of  the  appraisal  with  a
  general  description  of  the  real  estate  appraised,  and  for  which
  compensation shall be made. The court shall  also  direct  to  whom  the
  money  shall be paid, or in which trust company it shall be deposited by
  the comptroller. Such decree when so confirmed, except in the case of an
  appeal, as provided in section 5-369 of this subchapter, shall be  final
  and  conclusive as well upon the city as upon the owners and all persons
  interested in or entitled to such real estate, and also upon  all  other
  persons whomsoever.
