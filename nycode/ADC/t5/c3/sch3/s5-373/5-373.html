Section 5-373

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 5-373 How defects may be remedied. The supreme court of the judicial
  district  in  which  the real estate is situated shall have power at any
  time to correct  any  defect  or  informality  in  any  of  the  special
  proceedings  authorized  by  this  subchapter as may be necessary, or to
  cause other property to be included therein, and to direct such  further
  notices to be given to any party in interest, as it deems proper. If, in
  any  particular,  it shall, at any time, be found necessary to amend any
  pleading or proceeding, or supply any defect  therein,  arising  in  the
  course of any special proceeding authorized by this subchapter, the same
  may  be  amended  or supplied in such manner as shall be directed by the
  supreme court, which is hereby authorized  to  make  such  amendment  or
  correction.
