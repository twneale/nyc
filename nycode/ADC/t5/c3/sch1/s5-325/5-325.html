Section 5-325

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  5-325 Appeal to court of appeals. An appeal to the court of appeals
  may be taken by the city or  any  person  or  party  interested  in  the
  proceeding  and  aggrieved  by the order of the appellate division. Such
  appeal shall be taken and heard in the  manner  provided  by  the  civil
  practice  law  and  rules  and  the  rules  and practice of the court of
  appeals in relation to appeals from orders in  special  proceedings.  An
  appeal  taken  but  not prosecuted within six months after the filing of
  the notice of appeal, unless the time within which to prosecute the same
  shall have been extended by an order of the court, shall be deemed to be
  abandoned, and no agreement between the parties to the appeal  extending
  the  time  to  prosecute  the same shall vary the provisions hereof. The
  court of appeals may affirm or reverse the order appealed from, and  may
  make such order or direction as shall be appropriate to the case. If the
  final  decree  or decrees of the court shall be reversed by the court of
  appeals, such reversal shall not divest the city of title  to  the  real
  property affected by the appeal.
