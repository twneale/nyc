Section 5-338

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  5-338  Title acquired for streets; subject to certain easements. If
  any individual or corporation, before the entry of  the  order  granting
  the application to condemn, has acquired any easement for the purpose of
  laying  or  maintaining  in  the real property to be acquired for street
  purposes in a proceeding pursuant to this subchapter, underground  pipes
  or conduits for the distribution of water, gas, steam or electricity, or
  for  pneumatic service, such easement shall not be extinguished, but the
  title to the real property so to be acquired for the purposes authorized
  shall be taken subject to such easement; provided, however, that nothing
  herein contained shall be so construed as to limit the power of the city
  to acquire by purchase or by condemnation proceedings the  entire  plant
  or  service  of  such  individual  or  corporation,  or  to acquire such
  easement in such street in any other appropriate proceedings.
