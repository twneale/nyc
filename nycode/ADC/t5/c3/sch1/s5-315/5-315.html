  departmental estimate for a capital project shall furnish to  the  court
  such  surveys,  diagrams,  maps and plans as the court shall require, to
  enable the court to hear and determine the claims of the owners  of  the
  real  property  affected by the proceeding. Such surveys, diagrams, maps
  and plans shall distinctly indicate by separate numbers,  the  names  of
  the  claimants  to,  or  of the owners of the respective parcels of real
  property to be taken in such proceedings, so far as the same are  known,
  and   shall  also  specify  in  figures  with  sufficient  accuracy  the
  dimensions and bounds of each of such tracts to be taken. The court  may
  require  any  agency  of  the  city,  if  the  corporation counsel shall
  approve, to furnish such other surveys, diagrams,  maps  and  plans  and
  such other information as shall aid and assist the court in the trial or
  determination of the proceeding.
    b.  It  shall  be  lawful for the duly authorized agents of the agency
  furnishing such surveys, diagrams,  maps  and  plans,  and  all  persons
  acting  under  their  or its authority and by their or its direction, to
  enter in the daytime into and upon such real property which it shall  be
  necessary  so to enter, for the purpose of making such surveys, diagrams
  and maps or plans as such agency shall deem necessary.
