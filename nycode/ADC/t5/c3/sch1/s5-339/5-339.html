Section 5-339

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  5-339  Title  acquired for streets; subject to rights of railroads.
  The city may acquire for street purposes title in fee or to an easement,
  as may be determined by  the  mayor  to  any  real  property  heretofore
  acquired through purchase or condemnation by any railroad corporation in
  the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens for its corporate purposes and which
  real  property  lies  within  the  lines  of, is adjacent to, adjoins or
  separates any street or any part or parts thereof, now or hereafter laid
  out upon the city map, where the state  commissioner  of  transportation
  certifies  that  the ownership or exclusive use of such real property or
  easement thereover is no longer necessary to the carrying  out  of  such
  corporate  purposes.  Such title or easement, however, shall be acquired
  by the city subject to the right of the corporation to continue  to  use
  such  real  property  during the term of its corporate existence and for
  its corporate purposes, or in lieu thereof to use for a  like  term  and
  like  purposes  such other portion of the streets within which such real
  property shall lie, as the public service commission shall designate.
