Section 5-313

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  5-313 View by court. It shall be the duty of the justice trying any
  such proceeding, to view the real property to  be  thereby  acquired  in
  accordance with section five hundred ten of the eminent domain procedure
  law.  Where  title to real property being acquired in a proceeding shall
  have been vested in the city, and  buildings  or  improvements  situated
  thereon  shall have been removed or destroyed by the city or pursuant to
  its authority prior to the trial of  the  proceeding,  and  whereby  the
  justice  trying the proceeding is deprived of a view of the buildings or
  improvements so removed or destroyed, the fact that the justice has  not
  had  a  view  thereof shall not preclude the court from receiving on the
  trial of the  proceeding  testimony  and  evidence,  as  to  the  damage
  sustained  by the claimant by reason of the taking thereof, when offered
  on behalf of either the claimant or the city.
