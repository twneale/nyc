Section 5-326

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  5-326  Taxation  of costs, charges and expenses. a. The bill of the
  reasonable and necessary costs, charges and expenses which  by  law  are
  required  to be taxed shall not be paid or allowed until they shall have
  been taxed by the court after notice given as in this section  provided.
  Upon  such  taxation, due proof of the nature and extent of the services
  rendered and the  disbursements  charged  shall  be  furnished,  and  no
  unnecessary  costs  or  charges  shall be allowed. All items in the bill
  shall be stated in detail and shall be accompanied by such proof of  the
  reasonableness thereof and the necessity therefor, as is now required by
  law   and  the  practice  of  the  court  upon  taxation  of  costs  and
  disbursements in other special proceedings or  actions  in  such  court.
  Proof  by  affidavit  shall  also  be  given  of  the dates of rendering
  services.  No  such  claim  for  compensation,  in  a  capital   project
  proceeding,  shall  be  allowed  or  paid  unless it be accompanied by a
  certificate of the comptroller setting forth  that  the  same  has  been
  audited  and  examined,  and further certifying the result of such audit
  and examination. Such certificate shall be presumptive evidence  of  the
  correctness, reasonableness and necessity of such bill.
    b.  In  a capital project proceeding, the corporation counsel shall be
  given five days' notice of the taxation of the bill  of  costs,  charges
  and expenses.
    c.  Property owners appearing in the proceedings shall not be entitled
  to recover counsel fees, costs, disbursements or allowances,  except  as
  provided  in  sections  seven  hundred  one and seven hundred two of the
  eminent domain procedure law.
