Section 5-337

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  5-337  Title  acquired  for  streets  and  courtyards. a. The title
  acquired in real property required for any  streets  shall  be  kept  in
  trust,  that the same be appropriated and kept open for, or as part of a
  public street, forever, in like manner as the other streets in the  city
  are and of right ought to be.
    b.  The  mayor,  at  the  time of authorizing the proceedings in which
  lands are to be acquired for courtyard purposes, may  determine  whether
  the fee or an easement shall be acquired in lands required therefor, and
  the  mayor may prescribe such conditions and limitations on the title so
  to be acquired and as to the temporary or permanent use of the  land  so
  to  be  acquired  as he or she may deem proper. The title which the city
  shall acquire to the lands required for courtyard purposes shall be such
  as the mayor shall determine. Such title  shall  be  held  by  the  city
  subject to such limitations and conditions as to title thereto, or as to
  the  use thereof, as the mayor shall prescribe. If not inconsistent with
  such limitations and conditions as to title  or  as  to  the  use,  land
  acquired  for  courtyard  purposes may be devoted to general street uses
  whenever the board of estimate shall determine that the public  interest
  requires such use.
    c.  The title in fee acquired by the city to real property, except for
  street and courtyard purposes, shall be a fee simple absolute.
