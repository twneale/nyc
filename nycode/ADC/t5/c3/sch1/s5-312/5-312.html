  filed verified claims as provided in section 5-309 of  this  subchapter,
  have  proved their title or have failed to do so after being notified by
  the corporation counsel of the time and place when and where such  proof
  of  title would be received by him or her, the corporation counsel shall
  serve upon all parties or their  attorneys  who  have  appeared  in  the
  proceeding  a  note  of issue as provided in section five hundred six of
  the eminent domain procedure law. The clerk of the court must  thereupon
  enter  the  proceeding upon the proper calendar according to the date of
  the entry of the order granting the application  to  condemn.  When  the
  note  of  issue has been served and filed, the proceeding must remain on
  the calendar until finally disposed of.
