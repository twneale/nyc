    &sect;  5-206  Duties when accumulations in sinking funds are insufficient.
  Whenever it shall appear to the mayor  that  the  accumulations  in  any
  sinking  fund  of  the  city  established  prior to July first, nineteen
  hundred eighty-one will be insufficient  to  meet  the  payment  of  any
  corporate stock falling due in the next following fiscal year redeemable
  therefrom,  it shall be the mayor's duty to include in the annual budget
  for such year, such an amount to be  applied  to  the  payment  of  such
  corporate  stock as shall be sufficient to meet any such deficiency, and
  the amount shall be paid into such sinking fund.
