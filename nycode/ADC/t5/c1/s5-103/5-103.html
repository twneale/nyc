    &sect; 5-103 Departmental estimates; details. The departmental estimates of
  capital  projects  submitted  pursuant  to the provisions of section two
  hundred fourteen of the charter shall clearly distinguish between  those
  that  are  for  new  projects  and those that are for the continuance of
  projects already under way. In the case of pending  projects,  estimates
  shall be submitted showing the amount required to continue such projects
  throughout  the  next  fiscal year, the amount required to complete such
  projects  and  the  amount  already  appropriated  for  such   projects.
  Departmental  estimates  shall  also  include  detailed estimates of new
  projects which the head of each agency  believes  should  be  undertaken
  within  the  ensuing  fiscal year and the three succeeding fiscal years.
  Each departmental  estimate  shall  include  the  estimated  maintenance
  charges of the project when completed.
