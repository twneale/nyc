Section 26-516

<pre>
    
 
    * &sect;  26-516  Enforcement  and procedures. a. Subject to the conditions
  and limitations of this subdivision, any owner of housing accommodations
  who, upon complaint of a tenant, or of the state division of housing and
  community renewal, is  found  by  the  state  division  of  housing  and
  community  renewal,  after a reasonable opportunity to be heard, to have
  collected  an  overcharge  above  the  rent  authorized  for  a  housing
  accommodation  subject to this chapter shall be liable to the tenant for
  a penalty equal to three times the amount  of  such  overcharge.  In  no
  event  shall  such  treble  damage  penalty be assessed against an owner
  based solely on said owner's failure to file a timely or proper  initial
  or  annual  rent  registration  statement. If the owner establishes by a
  preponderance of the evidence that the overcharge was not  willful,  the
  state  division  of  housing  and  community renewal shall establish the
  penalty as the amount of the overcharge plus interest. (i) Except as  to
  complaints  filed  pursuant  to clause (ii) of this paragraph, the legal
  regulated rent for purposes of determining an overcharge, shall  be  the
  rent  indicated  in  the  annual registration statement filed four years
  prior to the most recent registration statement, (or, if  more  recently
  filed,  the  initial  registration  statement)  plus  in  each  case any
  subsequent lawful increases and adjustments. Where the  amount  of  rent
  set  forth  in  the  annual rent registration statement filed four years
  prior to the most recent registration statement is not challenged within
  four years  of  its  filing,  neither  such  rent  nor  service  of  any
  registration shall be subject to challenge at any time thereafter.
    (ii)  As  to  complaints  filed  within  ninety  days  of  the initial
  registration of a housing accommodation, the legal regulated rent  shall
  be  deemed  to  be  the rent charged on the date four years prior to the
  date of the initial registration of the housing  accommodation  (or,  if
  the housing accommodation was subject to this chapter for less than four
  years,  the  initial legal regulated rent) plus in each case, any lawful
  increases and adjustments. Where the rent charged on the date four years
  prior to the date of  the  initial  registration  of  the  accommodation
  cannot be established, such rent shall be established by the division.
    Where  the  rent  charged  on the date four years prior to the date of
  initial registration of the housing accommodation cannot be established,
  such rent shall be established by the division  provided  that  where  a
  rent  is established based on rentals determined under the provisions of
  the local emergency housing rent control act such rent must be  adjusted
  to  account  for  no  less  than  the  minimum  increases which would be
  permitted if the housing accommodation were covered under the provisions
  of this chapter. Where the amount of rent set forth in the  annual  rent
  registration  statement  filed  four  years  prior  to  the  most recent
  registration statement is  not  challenged  within  four  years  of  its
  filing,  neither  such  rent  nor  service  of any registration shall be
  subject to challenge at any time thereafter.
    (1) The order of the state division of housing and  community  renewal
  shall  apportion  the  owner's  liability  between  or among two or more
  tenants found to have  been  overcharged  by  such  owner  during  their
  particular tenancy of a unit.
    (2) Except as provided under clauses (i) and (ii) of this paragraph, a
  complaint  under this subdivision shall be filed with the state division
  of housing  and  community  renewal  within  four  years  of  the  first
  overcharge alleged and no determination of an overcharge and no award or
  calculation of an award of the amount of an overcharge may be based upon
  an  overcharge having occurred more than four years before the complaint
  is filed. (i) No penalty of three times the overcharge may be based upon
  an overcharge having occurred more than two years before  the  complaint
  is  filed  or  upon  an  overcharge which occurred prior to April first,

  nineteen hundred eighty-four. (ii) Any complaint based upon  overcharges
  occurring  prior  to the date of filing of the initial rent registration
  as provided in section 26-517 of this  chapter  shall  be  filed  within
  ninety days of the mailing of notice to the tenant of such registration.
  This  paragraph  shall preclude examination of the rental history of the
  housing accommodation prior to the four-year period preceding the filing
  of a complaint pursuant to this subdivision.
    (3) Any affected tenant shall be notified of and given an  opportunity
  to  join  in  any complaint filed by an officer or employee of the state
  division of housing and community renewal.
    (4) An owner found to have overcharged may be assessed the  reasonable
  costs  and  attorney's fees of the proceeding and interest from the date
  of the overcharge at the rate of interest payable on a judgment pursuant
  to section five thousand four of the civil practice law and rules.
    (5) The order of the state division of housing and  community  renewal
  awarding  penalties  may, upon the expiration of the period in which the
  owner may institute a proceeding pursuant to  article  seventy-eight  of
  the  civil  practice law and rules, be filed and enforced by a tenant in
  the same manner as a judgment or not in excess of twenty percent thereof
  per month may be offset against any rent thereafter due the owner.
    b. In addition to issuing the specific orders provided  for  by  other
  provisions  of  this  law,  the  state division of housing and community
  renewal shall be empowered to enforce this law and the code by  issuing,
  upon  notice  and  a reasonable opportunity for the affected party to be
  heard, such other orders as it may deem appropriate.
    c. If the owner is found by the commissioner:
    (1) to have violated an order of the  division  the  commissioner  may
  impose  by  administrative  order  after hearing, a civil penalty in the
  amount of one thousand dollars  for  the  first  such  offense  and  two
  thousand dollars for each subsequent offense; or
    ** (2)  to  have  harassed  a  tenant  to obtain vacancy of his or her
  housing accommodation, the commissioner  may  impose  by  administrative
  order  after  hearing,  a  civil  penalty  for  any such violation. Such
  penalty shall be in the amount of two thousand dollars for a first  such
  offense  and  up  to ten thousand dollars for each subsequent offense or
  for a violation consisting of conduct directed at the  tenants  of  more
  than one housing accommodation.
    ** NB Effective until June 16, 2015
    ** (2)  to  have  harassed  a  tenant  to obtain vacancy of his or her
  housing accommodation, the commissioner  may  impose  by  administrative
  order  after  hearing,  a  civil  penalty  for  any such violation. Such
  penalty shall be in the amount of two thousand dollars for a first  such
  offense  and  up  to ten thousand dollars for each subsequent offense or
  for a violation consisting of conduct directed at the  tenants  of  more
  than one housing accommodation.
    ** NB Effective June 16, 2015
    Such  order  shall be deemed a final determination for the purposes of
  judicial review. Such penalty may, upon the expiration of the period for
  seeking review pursuant to article seventy-eight of the  civil  practice
  law  and  rules, be docketed and enforced in the manner of a judgment of
  the supreme court.
    d. Any proceeding pursuant  to  article  seventy-eight  of  the  civil
  practice  law  and  rules  seeking review of any action pursuant to this
  chapter shall be brought within sixty days  of  the  expiration  of  the
  ninety day period and any extension thereof provided in subdivision h of
  this  section  or  the rendering of a determination, whichever is later.
  Any action or proceeding brought by or against  the  commissioner  under

  this   law  shall  be  brought  in  the  county  in  which  the  housing
  accommodation is located.
    e.  Violations  of this law, or of the code and orders issued pursuant
  thereto may be enjoined by the supreme court upon proceedings  commenced
  by  the  state division of housing and community renewal which shall not
  be required to post bond.
    f. In furtherance of its responsibility to enforce this law, the state
  division  of  housing  and  community  renewal  shall  be  empowered  to
  administer   oaths,   issue   subpoenas,  conduct  investigations,  make
  inspections and designate officers to  hear  and  report.  The  division
  shall  safeguard  the  confidentiality of information furnished to it at
  the request of the person furnishing same, unless such information  must
  be  made  public in the interest of establishing a record for the future
  guidance of persons subject to this law.
    g. Any owner who has duly registered a housing accommodation  pursuant
  to  section  26-517 of this chapter shall not be required to maintain or
  produce any records relating to rentals of such accommodation  for  more
  than  four  years  prior  to  the  most  recent  registration  or annual
  statement for such accommodation.
    h. The state  division  of  housing  and  community  renewal  may,  by
  regulation,   provide  for  administrative  review  of  all  orders  and
  determinations  issued  by  it  pursuant  to  this  chapter.  Any   such
  regulation  shall  provide  that  if  a  petition for such review is not
  determined within ninety days after it is filed, it shall be  deemed  to
  be  denied.  However, the division may grant one extension not to exceed
  thirty days with the consent of the  party  filing  such  petition;  any
  further extension may only be granted with the consent of all parties to
  the   petition.  No  proceeding  may  be  brought  pursuant  to  article
  seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules to challenge any order
  or determination which is subject to such administrative  review  unless
  such  review  has been sought and either (1) a determination thereon has
  been made or (2) the ninety day period provided for determination of the
  petition for review (or any extension thereof) has expired.
