Section 26-504.3

<pre>
    
 
    * &sect;  26-504.3  High  income  rent deregulation. (a) 1. For purposes of
  this section, annual income shall mean the federal adjusted gross income
  as reported on the New York state income tax return. Total annual income
  means the sum of the annual incomes  of  all  persons  whose  names  are
  recited  as  the  tenant  or co-tenant on a lease who occupy the housing
  accommodation  and  all  other   persons   that   occupy   the   housing
  accommodation  as  their  primary  residence  on  other than a temporary
  basis, excluding bona fide employees of such occupants residing  therein
  in connection with such employment and excluding bona fide subtenants in
  occupancy pursuant to the provisions of section two hundred twenty-six-b
  of  the  real property law. In the case where a housing accommodation is
  sublet, the annual income of the tenant  or  co-tenant  recited  on  the
  lease who will reoccupy the housing accommodation upon the expiration of
  the sublease shall be considered.
    2.  Deregulation  income  threshold means total annual income equal to
  one hundred seventy-five thousand dollars in each of the  two  preceding
  calendar years for proceedings commenced before July first, two thousand
  eleven.  For  proceedings commenced on or after July first, two thousand
  eleven, the deregulation income threshold means the total annual  income
  equal  to  two  hundred  thousand  dollars  in each of the two preceding
  calendar years.
    3.  Deregulation  rent  threshold  means  two  thousand  dollars   for
  proceedings  commenced  before  July  first,  two  thousand  eleven. For
  proceedings commenced on or after July first, two thousand  eleven,  the
  deregulation rent threshold means two thousand five hundred dollars.
    (b) On or before the first day of May in each calendar year, the owner
  of  each housing accommodation for which the legal regulated rent equals
  or exceeds the deregulation rent threshold may  provide  the  tenant  or
  tenants  residing  therein with an income certification form prepared by
  the division of housing and community renewal on which  such  tenant  or
  tenants  shall  identify  all  persons referred to in subdivision (a) of
  this section and shall certify whether the total  annual  income  is  in
  excess of the deregulation income threshold in each of the two preceding
  calendar  years.  Such  income  certification  form shall state that the
  income level certified to by the tenant may be subject  to  verification
  by  the  department  of  taxation  and  finance  pursuant to section one
  hundred seventy-one-b of the tax law and shall not require disclosure of
  any income information other than whether the  aforementioned  threshold
  has  been  exceeded.  Such income certification form shall clearly state
  that: (i) only tenants residing in housing accommodations which  have  a
  legal  regulated  monthly  rent, that equals or exceeds the deregulation
  rent threshold are required to complete  the  certification  form;  (ii)
  that  tenants  have  protections available to them which are designed to
  prevent harassment; (iii) that tenants are not required to  provide  any
  information regarding their income except that which is requested on the
  form   and  may  contain  such  other  information  the  division  deems
  appropriate.  The  tenant  or  tenants  shall   return   the   completed
  certification  to  the  owner  within thirty days after service upon the
  tenant or tenants.  In  the  event  that  the  total  annual  income  as
  certified  is  in excess of the deregulation income threshold in each of
  the two preceding calendar years, the owner may file  the  certification
  with  the  state  division of housing and community renewal on or before
  June thirtieth of such year. Upon filing  such  certification  with  the
  division, the division shall, within thirty days after the filing, issue
  an  order providing that such housing accommodation shall not be subject
  to the provisions of this act upon the expiration of the existing lease.
  A copy of such order shall be mailed  by  regular  and  certified  mail,

  return  receipt  requested,  to the tenant or tenants and a copy thereof
  shall be mailed to the owner.
    (c)  1.  In the event that the tenant or tenants either fail to return
  the completed certification to the owner on or before the date  required
  by   subdivision   (b)  of  this  section  or  the  owner  disputes  the
  certification returned by the tenant or tenants, the owner  may,  on  or
  before  June  thirtieth  of  such  year,  petition the state division of
  housing and community renewal to verify, pursuant to section one hundred
  seventy-one-b of the tax law, whether the total  annual  income  exceeds
  the  deregulation income threshold in each of the two preceding calendar
  years. Within twenty days after the filing  of  such  request  with  the
  division,  the  division shall notify the tenant or tenants named on the
  lease that such tenant or tenants must provide the  division  with  such
  information  as  the division and the department of taxation and finance
  shall require to verify whether the  total  annual  income  exceeds  the
  deregulation  income  threshold  in  each  of the two preceding calendar
  years. The division's notification shall require the tenant  or  tenants
  to  provide the information to the division within sixty days of service
  upon such tenant or tenants and shall include a warning  in  bold  faced
  type that failure to respond will result in an order being issued by the
  division  providing that such housing accommodation shall not be subject
  to the provisions of this law.
    2. If the department of taxation and finance determines that the total
  annual income is in excess of the deregulation income threshold in  each
  of  the  two  preceding calendar years, the division shall, on or before
  November fifteenth of such year, notify the owner  and  tenants  of  the
  results  of such verification. Both the owner and the tenants shall have
  thirty days within which to comment on such verification results. Within
  forty-five days after the expiration of the comment period, the division
  shall, where appropriate, issue an order  providing  that  such  housing
  accommodation  shall  not  be subject to the provisions of this law upon
  the expiration of the existing lease. A copy  of  such  order  shall  be
  mailed  by  regular and certified mail, return receipt requested, to the
  tenant or tenants and a copy thereof shall be sent to the owner.
    3. In the event the tenant or tenants fail to provide the  information
  required  pursuant  to  paragraph  one of this subdivision, the division
  shall issue, on  or  before  December  first  of  such  year,  an  order
  providing  that  such  housing accommodation shall not be subject to the
  provisions of this law upon the expiration of the current lease. A  copy
  of  such  order  shall  be  mailed by regular and certified mail, return
  receipt requested, to the tenant or tenants and a copy thereof shall  be
  sent to the owner.
    4.  The  provisions  of the state freedom of information act shall not
  apply to any income information obtained by  the  division  pursuant  to
  this section.
    (d) This section shall apply only to section 26-504.1 of this chapter.
    (e)  Upon  receipt  of  such  order  of  deregulation pursuant to this
  section, an owner shall offer the housing accommodation subject to  such
  order  to  the  tenant at a rent not in excess of the market rent, which
  for the purposes of this section means a rent  obtainable  in  an  arm's
  length  transaction.  Such  rental  offer  shall be made by the owner in
  writing to the tenant by certified and regular mail and shall inform the
  tenant that such offer must be accepted in writing within  ten  days  of
  receipt.  The tenant shall respond within ten days after receipt of such
  offer.  If the tenant declines the offer or fails to respond within such
  period, the owner may commence an action or proceeding for the  eviction
  of such tenant.
