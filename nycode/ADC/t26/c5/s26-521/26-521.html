  to the hotel stabilization provisions  of  the  rent  stabilization  law
  except  to the extent permitted by law pursuant to a warrant of eviction
  or other order of a court of competent jurisdiction  or  a  governmental
  vacate order by:
    (1)  using  or  threatening the use of force to induce the occupant to
  vacate the dwelling unit; or
    (2) engaging in a course  of  conduct  which  interferes  with  or  is
  intended  to  interfere  with  or  disturb the comfort, repose, peace or
  quiet of such occupant in the use or occupancy of the dwelling unit,  to
  induce  the  occupant  to  vacate  the  dwelling unit including, but not
  limited to, the interruption or discontinuance of essential services; or
    (3) engaging or threatening to  engage  in  any  other  conduct  which
  prevents  or  is  intended  to  prevent  such  occupant  from the lawful
  occupancy of such dwelling unit or to induce the occupant to vacate  the
