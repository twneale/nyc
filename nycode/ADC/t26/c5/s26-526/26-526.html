    &sect; 26-526 Notice of pendency. a. In any action or proceeding instituted
  under  this  chapter,  the  corporation  counsel  may file in the county
  clerk's office of the county where the dwelling affected by such  action
  or  proceeding  is  situated, a notice of the pendency of such action or
  proceeding. Such notice may be filed at the time of the commencement  of
  the  action  or  proceeding,  or  at  any  time afterwards, before final
  judgment or order. The corporation counsel shall  designate  in  writing
  the  name of each person against whom the notice is filed and the number
  of each block on the land map of the county which  is  affected  by  the
  notice. The county clerk in whose office the notice of pendency is filed
  shall  record  and  index  such  notice  against  the  names  and blocks
  designated.
    b. Any such notice may be vacated upon the order of  a  judge  of  the
  court  in  which such action or proceeding was instituted or is pending,
  or upon the consent in writing of the corporation counsel. The clerk  of
  the  county  where  such  notice  is filed shall cancel such notice upon
  receipt of such consent or of a certified copy of such order.
