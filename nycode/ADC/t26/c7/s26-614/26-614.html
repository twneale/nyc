Section 26-614

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  26-614  Certain exemption orders. Notwithstanding the provisions of
  this chapter, a tenant who resides in  a  dwelling  unit  which  becomes
  subject  to  this  chapter  upon the sale by the city of New York of the
  building in which such dwelling unit is situated may be  issued  a  rent
  increase  exemption  order  for  increases in rent which occurred during
  ownership of such building by the city of New York  provided  that  such
  tenant  would  have  been  otherwise eligible to receive a rent increase
  exemption order at the time of such increase but for the fact that  such
  tenant  occupied  a  dwelling unit owned by the city of New York and was
  therefore not  subject  to  this  chapter.  Application  for  such  rent
  increase  exemption  orders  shall be made within one year from the date
  such building is sold by the city of New York or within one year of  the
  effective date of this provision, whichever is later.
