Section 26-608

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  26-608 Credit allowances; penalties for overcharge. Upon receipt of
  a copy of a rent increase exemption order/tax abatement certificate, the
  housing company managing the dwelling unit of the eligible head  of  the
  household  shall  promptly  accord to the eligible head of the household
  covered by such order/certificate the  appropriate  credit  against  the
  monthly maximum rent then and thereafter payable. To the extent the full
  amount  of  such  credit has not been accorded for any past period since
  the effective date  specified  in  the  order/certificate,  the  housing
  company  shall  credit the total aggregate amount not so credited to the
  monthly maximum rent next payable or to such subsequent monthly  maximum
  rents,  as  the supervising agency may authorize. It shall be illegal to
  collect any  amount  for  which  a  rent  increase  exemption  order/tax
  abatement certificate provides credit or to withhold credit for any such
  amounts  already  collected,  and  collection  or  retention of any such
  amount for a dwelling  unit  occupied  by  such  eligible  head  of  the
  household  shall  be  deemed  a  rent  overcharge,  and  upon conviction
  therefor  the  housing  company  and  its  directors  and  any  employee
  responsible  therefor  shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a
  fine not to exceed one thousand dollars or imprisonment  not  to  exceed
  six months, or both.
