  chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor  and  upon  conviction  thereof
  shall  be  punished by a fine of not less than one hundred nor more than
  one thousand dollars. Except as otherwise provided in subdivision  b  of
  this section, any person who violates or assists in the violation of any
  section  of  this  chapter  shall  be  subject to a civil penalty of one
  hundred dollars per day per unit for each day that a building is not  in
  compliance with the provisions of such sections; provided, however, that
  such civil penalty shall not exceed one thousand dollars per unit.
    b.  Any  person  who knowingly violates or assists in the violation of
  section 26-703 of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon
  conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine not more than  two  times
  the  amount  required  to  be reserved by section 26-703 of this chapter
  which was not so reserved. Any person who violates  or  assists  in  the
  violation  of  section 26-703 of this chapter shall also be subject to a
  civil penalty of one thousand dollars per day  for  each  day  that  the
  reserve  fund  required  by  section  26-703  of  this  chapter  is  not

  the amount required to be reserved pursuant to section  26-703  of  this
  chapter.
    c.  In  addition,  any  other  action  or  proceeding  in any court of
  competent jurisdiction that may be  appropriate  or  necessary  for  the
  enforcement of the provisions of this chapter may be brought in the name
  of the city, including actions to secure permanent injunctions enjoining
  any  acts  or practices which constitute a violation of any provision of
  this chapter, mandating compliance with the provisions of  this  chapter
  or  for  such  other relief as may be appropriate. In any such action or
  proceeding the city may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction, or

  violating any provision of this chapter, mandating compliance  with  the
  provisions  of  this  chapter,  or  for  such  other  relief  as  may be
  appropriate, until the hearing  and  determination  of  such  action  or
  proceeding  and the entry of final judgment or order therein. The court,
  or judge or justice thereof, to whom such application is made, is hereby
  authorized forthwith to make any or all of the orders  above  specified,
  as  may  be required in such application, with or without notice, and to
  make such other or further orders or directions as may be  necessary  to
  render  the  same  effectual.    No  undertaking  shall be required as a
  condition of the granting  or  issuing  of  such  order,  or  by  reason
  thereof.
    d. Nothing contained in this section shall impair any rights, remedies
  or  causes  of  action  accrued or accruing to purchasers of cooperative
  shares or condominium units.
    e. The department of housing preservation and development is empowered
  to enforce the provisions of this chapter.
