Section 26-403.1

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  26-403.1 High income rent deregulation. (a) 1. For purposes of this
  section, annual income shall mean the federal adjusted gross  income  as
  reported  on  the  New York state income tax return. Total annual income
  means the sum of the annual  incomes  of  all  persons  who  occupy  the
  housing  accommodation  as  their  primary  residence  other  than  on a
  temporary  basis,  excluding  bona  fide  employees  of  such  occupants
  residing  therein  in connection with such employment and excluding bona
  fide subtenants in occupancy pursuant to the provisions of  section  two
  hundred  twenty-six-b  of  the  real  property  law. In the case where a
  housing accommodation is sublet, the  annual  income  of  the  sublessor
  shall be considered.
    2.  Deregulation  income  threshold means total annual income equal to
  one hundred seventy-five thousand dollars in each of the  two  preceding
  calendar  years  for  proceedings  commenced  prior  to  July first, two
  thousand eleven. For proceedings commenced on or after July  first,  two
  thousand  eleven,  the  deregulation  income  threshold  means the total
  annual income equal to two hundred thousand dollars in each of  the  two
  preceding calendar years.
    3.   Deregulation  rent  threshold  means  two  thousand  dollars  for
  proceedings commenced  before  July  first,  two  thousand  eleven.  For
  proceedings  commenced  on or after July first, two thousand eleven, the
  deregulation rent threshold means two thousand five hundred dollars.
    (b) On or before the first day of May in each calendar year, the owner
  of each housing accommodation for  which  the  maximum  rent  equals  or
  exceeds  the  deregulation  rent  threshold  may  provide  the tenant or
  tenants residing therein with an income certification form  prepared  by
  the  division  of  housing and community renewal on which such tenant or
  tenants shall identify all persons referred to  in  subdivision  (a)  of
  this  section  and  shall  certify whether the total annual income is in
  excess of the deregulation income threshold in each of the two preceding
  calendar years. Such income certification  form  shall  state  that  the
  income  level  certified to by the tenant may be subject to verification
  by the department of  taxation  and  finance  pursuant  to  section  one
  hundred seventy-one-b of the tax law and shall not require disclosure of
  any  income  information other than whether the aforementioned threshold
  has been exceeded. Such income certification form  shall  clearly  state
  that:  (i)  only tenants residing in housing accommodations which have a
  maximum monthly rent  that  equals  or  exceeds  the  deregulation  rent
  threshold  are  required  to  complete the certification form; (ii) that
  tenants have protections available to them which are designed to prevent
  harassment;  (iii)  that  tenants  are  not  required  to  provide   any
  information regarding their income except that which is requested on the
  form   and  may  contain  such  other  information  the  division  deems
  appropriate.  The  tenant  or  tenants  shall   return   the   completed
  certification  to  the  owner  within thirty days after service upon the
  tenant or tenants.  In  the  event  that  the  total  annual  income  as
  certified  is  in excess of the deregulation income threshold in each of
  the two preceding calendar years, the owner may file  the  certification
  with  the  state  division of housing and community renewal on or before
  June thirtieth of such year. Upon filing  such  certification  with  the
  division, the division shall, within thirty days after the filing, issue
  an  order  of  deregulation  providing  that such housing accommodations
  shall not be subject to the provisions of this law as of the  first  day
  of  June  in the year next succeeding the filing of the certification by
  the owner. A copy of such order shall be mailed by regular and certified
  mail, return receipt requested, to the tenant  or  tenants  and  a  copy
  thereof shall be mailed to the owner.

    (c)  1.  In the event that the tenant or tenants either fail to return
  the completed certification to the owner on or before the date  required
  by   subdivision   (b)  of  this  section  or  the  owner  disputes  the
  certification returned by the tenant or tenants, the owner  may,  on  or
  before  June  thirtieth  of  such  year,  petition the state division of
  housing and community renewal to verify, pursuant to section one hundred
  seventy-one-b of the tax law, whether the total  annual  income  exceeds
  the  deregulation income threshold in each of the two preceding calendar
  years. Within twenty days after the filing  of  such  request  with  the
  division,  the  division  shall  notify  the tenant or tenants that such
  tenant or tenants must provide the division with such information as the
  division and the department of taxation and  finance  shall  require  to
  verify  whether  the total annual income exceeds the deregulation income
  threshold in each of the two preceding calendar  years.  The  division's
  notification  shall  require  the  tenant  or  tenants  to  provide  the
  information to the division within  sixty  days  of  service  upon  such
  tenant  or  tenants  and shall include a warning in bold faced type that
  failure to respond will result in an order of deregulation being  issued
  by the division for such housing accommodation.
    2. If the department of taxation and finance determines that the total
  annual  income is in excess of the deregulation income threshold in each
  of the two preceding calendar years, the division shall,  on  or  before
  November  fifteenth  of  such  year, notify the owner and tenants of the
  results of such verification. Both the owner and the tenants shall  have
  thirty days within which to comment on such verification results. Within
  forty-five days after the expiration of the comment period, the division
  shall,  where appropriate, issue an order of deregulation providing that
  such housing accommodation shall not be subject  to  the  provisions  of
  this  law  as  of the first day of March in the year next succeeding the
  filing of the owner's petition with the division. A copy of  such  order
  shall be mailed by regular and certified mail, return receipt requested,
  to the tenant or tenants and a copy thereof shall be sent to the owner.
    3.  In the event the tenant or tenants fail to provide the information
  required pursuant to paragraph one of  this  subdivision,  the  division
  shall  issue,  on  or  before  December  first of such year, an order of
  deregulation providing that such  housing  accommodation  shall  not  be
  subject  to  the  provisions of this law as of the first day of March in
  the year next succeeding the last day on which  the  tenant  or  tenants
  were  required  to provide the information required by such paragraph. A
  copy of such order shall be mailed by regular and certified mail, return
  receipt requested, to the tenant or tenants and a copy thereof shall  be
  sent to the owner.
    4.  The  provisions  of the state freedom of information act shall not
  apply to any income information obtained by  the  division  pursuant  to
  this section.
    (d) This section shall apply only to subparagraph (j) of paragraph two
  of subdivision e of section 26-403 of this chapter.
    (e)  Upon  receipt  of  such  order  of  deregulation pursuant to this
  section, an owner shall offer the housing accommodation subject to  such
  order  to  the  tenant at a rent not in excess of the market rent, which
  for the purposes of this section means a rent  obtainable  in  an  arm's
  length  transaction.  Such  rental  offer  shall be made by the owner in
  writing to the tenant by certified and regular mail and shall inform the
  tenant that such offer must be accepted in writing within  ten  days  of
  receipt.  The tenant shall respond within ten days after receipt of such
  offer.  If the tenant declines the offer or fails to respond within such
  period, the owner may commence an action or proceeding for the  eviction
  of such tenant.
