Section 26-413

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  26-413  Enforcement  and  penalties.  a.  Any  person  who wilfully
  violates any provision of section 26-412 of this chapter shall be guilty
  of and punishable for a crime as specified in subdivision ten of section
  one of the state enabling act, namely such persons shall be subject to a
  fine of not more than five thousand dollars, or to imprisonment for  not
  more  than  two  years  in  the  case of a violation of subdivision c of
  section 26-412 of this chapter and for not more than  one  year  in  all
  other cases, or to both such fine and imprisonment. The city rent agency
  may  certify such facts, which in its opinion constitute such violation,
  to the district attorney having jurisdiction thereof.
    b. (1) The city rent agency may, whenever in its judgment  any  person
  has  engaged  in  or  is  about  to  engage  in  acts or practices which
  constitute a violation of  any  provision  of  section  26-412  of  this
  chapter, apply to the supreme court for an order (a) enjoining such acts
  or  practices,  (b)  enforcing  compliance  with  such provision of said
  section or with an  order  issued  by  the  city  rent  agency,  or  (c)
  directing  the landlord to correct such violation of such provision; and
  upon sufficient showing, the supreme court  may  issue  a  temporary  or
  permanent  injunction,  restraining  order  or other order, all of which
  shall be granted without bond. Jurisdiction shall not be deemed  lacking
  in  the  supreme  court  because  a defense is based upon an order of an
  inferior court.
    (2) The city rent agency may, whenever in its judgment any person  has
  engaged  in  acts  or  practices  which  constitute  a  violation of any
  provision of section 26-412 of this chapter:
    * (a) Impose by administrative order after hearing,  a  civil  penalty
  for any violation of said section and bring an action to recover same in
  any  court  of  competent  jurisdiction.  Such  penalty in the case of a
  violation of subdivision d of such section shall be in the amount of two
  thousand dollars for the first offense and ten thousand dollars for each
  subsequent offense or for a violation consisting of conduct directed  at
  the  tenants  of more than one housing accommodation; and in the case of
  any other violation of such  section  in  the  amount  of  one  thousand
  dollars  for  the  first  such offense and two thousand dollars for each
  subsequent offense. Such order by the city rent agency shall be deemed a
  final determination for the purposes of judicial review as  provided  in
  section  26-411  of this chapter. Such action shall be brought on behalf
  of the city and any  amount  recovered  shall  be  paid  into  the  city
  treasury.  Such right of action may be released, compromised or adjusted
  by the city rent agency at any time subsequent to the issuance  of  such
  administrative order.
    * NB Effective until June 16, 2015
    * (a)  Impose  by  administrative order after hearing, a civil penalty
  for any violation of said section and bring an action to recover same in
  any court of competent jurisdiction. Such  penalty  in  the  case  of  a
  violation of subdivision d of such section shall be in the amount of two
  thousand  dollars  for a first such offense and ten thousand dollars for
  each subsequent  offense  or  for  a  violation  consisting  of  conduct
  directed  at  the tenants of more than one housing accommodation; and in
  the case of any other violation of such section in  the  amount  of  one
  thousand dollars for the first such offense and two thousand dollars for
  each  subsequent  offense.  Such  order by the city rent agency shall be
  deemed a final determination for the  purposes  of  judicial  review  as
  provided in section 26-411 of this chapter. Such action shall be brought
  on  behalf  of  the city and any amount recovered shall be paid into the
  city treasury. Such right of action  may  be  released,  compromised  or
  adjusted  by the city rent agency at any time subsequent to the issuance
  of such administrative order.

    * NB Effective June 16, 2015
    (b)  Commence  an  action  to  recover  damages,  as  provided  for in
  paragraph two of subdivision d of this section in the event that (i) the
  tenant has not previously commenced such an action as  therein  provided
  and  (ii)  more than six months have elapsed since the occurrence of the
  violation or issuance of the order. An action  instituted  by  the  city
  rent agency shall constitute a bar to an action by the person aggrieved.
  The  city  rent  agency  shall pay over one-half of the sum recovered in
  such action to the person aggrieved and one-half to the  city  treasury,
  exclusive of costs and disbursements.
    (3)  (a)  Subject  to  the  provisions  of  subparagraph  (b)  of this
  paragraph, make a finding  of  harassment  whenever  it  determines  the
  existence  of  a  violation  of  subdivision d of section 26-412 of this
  chapter in which event the city rent agency may (i) dismiss any  pending
  application  for  a  certificate  of  eviction  and grant any subsequent
  application for such certificate only upon such terms and conditions  as
  it deems necessary to prevent the circumvention or evasion of provisions
  of  this chapter; (ii) determine that such housing accommodations or any
  replacement or  subdivision  thereof  (whether  or  not  by  demolition,
  alteration  or  substantial  rehabilitation)  shall  constitute  housing
  accommodations subject to control under the provisions of this  chapter,
  notwithstanding  any  definition of that term to the contrary; and (iii)
  to refuse to credit any adjustments increasing rent mandated by  section
  26-405  of  this  chapter and dismiss any applications for an adjustment
  pursuant to said  section  for  such  time  and  under  such  terms  and
  conditions   as   the  city  rent  agency  deems  necessary  to  prevent
  circumvention or evasion of the provisions of this chapter.
    (b) No proceeding to determine  whether  housing  accommodations  have
  become  vacant  as  a  result  of harassment may be commenced later than
  thirty days after the entire structure shall have been  vacated,  unless
  the  landlord  failed  to certify his or her intent to alter or demolish
  the premises as provided by subdivision c  of  section  26-408  of  this
  chapter.  No  proceeding  shall be maintained for acts performed in good
  faith and  in  a  reasonable  manner  for  the  purposes  of  operating,
  maintaining  or  repairing  any  building  or part thereof. A finding of
  harassment shall be attached to and noted upon the registration  of  the
  housing  accommodations  affected  by  such findings, and a copy thereof
  shall be filed and docketed in the manner of a notice of mechanic's lien
  affecting the property. The provisions of this paragraph shall bind  all
  persons  or  parties  who  succeed  to  the  landlord's interest in said
  housing accommodations.
    (4) Revoke any order or determination  based  upon  any  statement  or
  entry  false in any material respect in any document or report submitted
  in any proceeding before the city rent agency or required to be kept  or
  filed under this chapter or any requirements thereunder.
    c. (1) Any court shall advance on the docket or otherwise expedite the
  disposition  of  any  action or proceeding brought before it pursuant to
  the provisions of subdivision b of this section.
    (2) The provisions of subdivision b of this  section  are  cumulative.
  The  enforcement  of one provision thereof shall not constitute a bar to
  the enforcement  by  action,  proceeding  or  by  making  a  finding  or
  determination pursuant to other provisions of said subdivision.
    (3)  The  city  rent  agency  may  direct that a refund payment to the
  tenant for rent collected in  violation  of  subdivision  a  of  section
  26-412 include interest from the date of each excessive payment of rent.
  Where  the  city  rent  agency  has  revoked  an  order or determination
  premised on a false statement or entry, it may withhold issuance  of  an
  order  granting increase in maximum rent for such housing accommodations

  until the landlord has complied  with  the  refund  directive,  if  any,
  provided for in such order of revocation.
    d.  (1)  Where after the city rent agency has granted a certificate of
  eviction authorizing the landlord to pursue his or her remedies pursuant
  to law to acquire possession and a tenant  voluntarily  removes  from  a
  housing  accommodation  or  has  been  removed  therefrom  by  action or
  proceeding  to  evict  from  or  recover   possession   of   a   housing
  accommodation  upon  the ground that the landlord seeks in good faith to
  recover possession of such accommodation:
    (a) For his or her immediate and personal use, or  for  the  immediate
  and  personal use by a member or members of his or her immediate family,
  and such landlord or members of his or her immediate family  shall  fail
  to  occupy  such  accommodation  within  thirty  days  after  the tenant
  vacates; or
    (b)  For  the  immediate   purpose   of   withdrawing   such   housing
  accommodation  from  the rental market, and such landlord shall lease or
  sell the housing accommodation or the space previously occupied thereby,
  or permit use thereof in  a  manner  other  than  contemplated  in  such
  eviction  certificate  within a period of one year after such removal of
  the tenant; or
    (c) For the immediate purpose of altering or remodeling  such  housing
  accommodation, and the landlord (who required possession for the purpose
  of effecting such alteration or remodeling) shall fail to start the work
  of  alteration or remodeling of such housing accommodation within ninety
  days after the removal of the last tenant whose removal is necessary  to
  enable  the  landlord  to  effect  such alteration or remodeling of such
  accommodation, or if after having commenced  such  work  shall  fail  or
  neglect to prosecute the work with reasonable diligence; or
    (d)   For   the   immediate   purpose   of  demolishing  such  housing
  accommodations and  constructing  a  new  building  in  accordance  with
  approved  plans,  or  reasonable amendment thereof, and the landlord has
  failed to complete the demolition within six months after the removal of
  the last tenant or,  having  demolished  the  premises,  has  failed  or
  neglected  to proceed with the new construction within ninety days after
  the completion of such demolition, or having commenced such construction
  work, has failed or neglected to prosecute  such  work  with  reasonable
  diligence; or
    (e)  For  some  purpose other than those specified above for which the
  removal of the tenant was sought and the landlord has failed to use  the
  vacated premises for such purposes; such landlord shall, unless for good
  cause  shown  be  liable  to  the  tenant  for  three  times the damages
  sustained on account of such removal plus reasonable attorney's fees and
  costs as determined by the court provided that the tenant commences such
  action within three years from the expiration  of  the  applicable  time
  period  as  set  forth in this subdivision. The damages sustained by the
  tenant under this subdivision shall be the difference between  the  rent
  paid  for  the housing accommodation from which such tenant was evicted,
  and the rental value of a comparable housing accommodation on  the  open
  market.  In  addition  to  any  other damage, the cost of removal of the
  tenant's property shall be a  lawful  measure  of  damages.  The  remedy
  herein   provided  shall  be  in  addition  to  those  provided  for  in
  subdivisions a and b of this section. Such acts  and  omissions  on  the
  part  of  a  landlord  after  issuance  of a certificate of eviction are
  hereby declared to be  consistent  with  the  purposes  for  which  such
  certificate of eviction was issued.
    (2)  A  tenant  may bring an action against his or her landlord in any
  court of competent jurisdiction for a  violation  of  subdivision  a  of
  section  26-412  of  this chapter within: (a) two years from the date of

  occurrence of an overcharge, defined to mean the  amount  by  which  the
  consideration  paid  by  a  tenant  to a landlord exceeds the applicable
  maximum rent, or (b) within one year after the landlord fails to  pay  a
  refund  as  ordered  by the city rent agency, such time to be calculated
  from thirty-three days after the date of the issuance of  the  order  or
  when  the order becomes final, whichever is later, or (c) in the case of
  an act proscribed by subdivision e of section 26-412  of  this  chapter,
  within  two  years  after  knowledge  of  such statement or omission and
  consequent violation has  been  made  known  to  the  city  agency.  The
  landlord  shall  be  liable  for reasonable attorney's fees and costs as
  determined by the court, plus whichever of the  following  sums  is  the
  greater:  (i)  such  amount  not more than three times the amount of the
  overcharge, or the overcharges, upon which the action is  based  as  the
  court  in  its  discretion may determine or (ii) an amount not less than
  twenty-five dollars, provided, however, that such amount  shall  be  the
  amount   of  the  overcharge  or  overcharges  or  twenty-five  dollars,
  whichever is greater, if the defendant proves that the violation of  the
  regulation  or  order  in  question was neither wilful nor the result of
  failure to take practicable precautions against the  occurrence  of  the
  violation.
    (3)  A tenant or occupant who is unlawfully removed by a landlord from
  any housing accommodation  may,  within  two  years  from  the  date  of
  occurrence,  bring a civil action against the landlord by reason of such
  unlawful removal. In such action, the landlord shall be  liable  to  the
  tenant  for three times the damages sustained on account of such removal
  plus reasonable attorney's fees and costs as determined  by  the  court.
  The  damages  sustained  by the tenant under this paragraph shall be the
  difference between the rent paid  for  the  housing  accommodation  from
  which  such  tenant  was  evicted  and  the rental value of a comparable
  housing accommodation on the open  market.  In  addition  to  any  other
  damage  the  cost  of removal of the tenant's property shall be a lawful
  measure of damage.
    e. No person (including, but not limited to any officer or employee of
  the city rent agency) shall be held liable for damages or  penalties  in
  any  court, on any grounds for or in respect of anything done or omitted
  to be done in good faith pursuant to any provision of the state rent act
  or of this chapter, or any regulation, order, or requirement thereunder,
  notwithstanding that subsequently such provision, regulation,  order  or
  requirement  may be modified, rescinded, or determined to be invalid. In
  any action or proceeding wherein a party relies for ground of relief  or
  defense  or  raises  issue  or  brings into question the construction or
  validity of any provision of this chapter or any regulation,  order,  or
  requirement  thereunder, the court having jurisdiction of such action or
  proceeding may at any stage certify such fact to the city  rent  agency.
  The city rent agency may intervene in any such action or proceeding.
