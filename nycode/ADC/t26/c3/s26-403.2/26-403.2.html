  section have vacated the housing accommodation and a  family  member  of
  such  vacating  tenant or tenants is entitled to and continues to occupy
  the housing accommodation subject to the protections  of  this  law,  if
  such accommodation continues to be subject to this law after such family
  member   vacates,   on  the  occurrence  of  such  vacancy  the  maximum

  this  law  and  shall  be  applicable  in  like  manner  to  each second
