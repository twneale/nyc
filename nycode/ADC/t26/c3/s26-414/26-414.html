<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  26-414  Decontrol  on basis of vacancy rate. Whenever the city rent
  agency shall find, after making such studies and  investigations  as  it
  deems  necessary  for  such  purpose,  or  for processing an application
  supported by adequate proof filed by an  interested  party  pursuant  to
  regulation  that  the  percentage  of vacancies in all or any particular
  class of housing accommodations in the city, as such class is determined
  by the city rent agency, is  five  per  centum  or  more,  the  controls
  imposed  on  rents  and  evictions by and pursuant to this chapter, with
  respect to the housing accommodations as to which such finding has  been
  made,  shall  be  forthwith  scheduled  for  orderly decontrol, with due
  regard to preventing uncertainty, hardship and dislocation, by order  of
  such  agency;  provided,  however, that notwithstanding any provision of
  this section to the contrary, such agency shall not order the  decontrol
  of  any  particular class of housing accommodations as to which it shall
  find that the percentage of vacancies is  less  than  five  per  centum;
  provided,  further,  that no such order shall be made unless such agency
  shall hold a public hearing on such proposal at which interested persons
  are given a reasonable opportunity to be heard. Notice of  such  hearing
  shall  be  provided by publication thereof, on at least five days during
  the period of fifteen days next preceding the date of  the  commencement
  of such hearing, in the City Record and in at least two daily newspapers
  having general circulation in the city.
