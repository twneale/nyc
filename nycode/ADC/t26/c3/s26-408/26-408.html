    &sect;  26-408  Evictions.  a. No tenant, so long as he or she continues to
  pay the rent to which the landlord is entitled, shall  be  removed  from
  any  housing  accommodation  which is subject to rent control under this
  chapter by action to evict or to recover possession, by  exclusion  from
  possession,  or  otherwise, nor shall any person attempt such removal or
  exclusion from possession notwithstanding the fact that the  tenant  has
  no  lease  or  that  his  or  her  lease, or other rental agreement, has
  expired or otherwise terminated,  notwithstanding  any  contract,  lease
  agreement,  or  obligation  heretofore  or  hereafter entered into which
  provides for  surrender  of  possession,  or  which  otherwise  provides
  contrary  hereto,  except  on  one  or more of the following grounds, or
  unless the landlord has obtained a certificate of eviction  pursuant  to
  subdivision b of this section:
    (1)  The  tenant  is  violating a substantial obligation of his or her
  tenancy other than  the  obligation  to  surrender  possession  of  such
  housing  accommodation  and  has  failed  to  cure  such violation after
  written notice by the landlord that the violation cease within ten days,
  or within the three month period immediately prior to  the  commencement
  of  the  proceeding  the tenant has wilfully violated such an obligation
  inflicting serious and substantial injury to the landlord; or
    (2) The tenant is committing or permitting a nuisance in such  housing
  accommodation;  or  is  maliciously  or  by  reason  of gross negligence
  substantially damaging the housing accommodation; or his or her  conduct
  is such as to interfere substantially with the comfort and safety of the
  landlord  or of other tenants or occupants of the same or other adjacent
  building or structure; or
    (3) Occupancy of the housing accommodation by the  tenant  is  illegal
  because of the requirements of law, and the landlord is subject to civil
  or  criminal  penalties  therefor, or both, provided, however, that such
  occupancy shall not be considered illegal by reason of violations placed
  against the housing accommodations or the building  in  which  same  are
  located  by  any  department  or  agency of the city having jurisdiction
  unless such department or agency  has  issued  an  order  requiring  the
  tenants  to  vacate  said  accommodation  or  building  or  unless  such
  occupancy for such building or such violations relied on by the landlord
  result from an act, omission or  situation  caused  or  created  by  the
  tenant; or
    (4) The tenant is using or permitting such housing accommodation to be
  used for an immoral or illegal purpose; or
    (5)  The  tenant  who  had  a  written  lease  or other written rental
  agreement which terminated or shall terminate on  or  after  May  first,
  nineteen  hundred  fifty,  has  refused  upon  demand of the landlord to
  execute a written extension or renewal thereof for  a  further  term  of
  like  duration not in excess of one year but otherwise on the same terms
  and conditions as the previous lease except in so far as such terms  and
  conditions are inconsistent with this chapter; or
    (6)  The  tenant  has  unreasonably refused the landlord access to the
  housing accommodation for the purpose of  making  necessary  repairs  or
  improvements  required  by  law  or  for the purpose of inspection or of
  showing the accommodation  to  a  prospective  purchaser,  mortgagee  or
  prospective  mortgagee,  or  other  person  having a legitimate interest
  therein; provided, however, that in the latter event such refusal  shall
  not  be  ground for removal or eviction if such inspection or showing of
  the accommodation is contrary to the provisions of the tenant's lease or
  other rental agreement.
    (7) The eviction is sought by the owner of  a  dwelling  unit  or  the
  shares  allocated  thereto  where  such  dwelling  unit  is located in a
  structure owned as a cooperative or as a  condominium  and  an  offering

  prospectus  for the conversion of such structure pursuant to an eviction
  plan shall have been submitted  to  the  attorney  general  pursuant  to
  section  three  hundred  fifty-two-eeee  of the general business law and
  accepted for filing by the attorney general, and been declared effective
  in  accordance  with  such  law,  and  any  right of continued occupancy
  granted by such law to a non-purchasing  tenant  in  occupancy  of  such
  dwelling  unit  shall  have  expired;  provided  that  the  owner of the
  dwelling unit or the shares allocated thereto seeks  in  good  faith  to
  recover  possession  of  a dwelling unit for his or her own personal use
  and occupancy or for the use and  occupancy  of  his  or  her  immediate
  family.
    b.  No  tenant shall be removed or evicted on grounds other than those
  stated in subdivision a of this section unless  on  application  of  the
  landlord   the  city  rent  agency  shall  issue  an  order  granting  a
  certificate of eviction in accordance with  its  rules  and  regulations
  designed  to  effectuate  the  purposes  of  this  title, permitting the
  landlord to pursue his or her remedies at  law.  The  city  rent  agency
  shall issue such an order whenever it finds that:
    (1)  The  landlord  seeks  in  good  faith  to recover possession of a
  housing accommodation because of immediate and compelling necessity  for
  his  or  her own personal use and occupancy or for the use and occupancy
  of his or her immediate family provided, however, that this  subdivision
  shall  not  apply where a member of the household lawfully occupying the
  housing accommodation is sixty-two years of age or  older,  has  been  a
  tenant  in  a housing accommodation in that building for twenty years or
  more, or has an impairment which results from anatomical,  physiological
  or  psychological conditions, other than addiction to alcohol, gambling,
  or  any  controlled  substance,  which  are  demonstrable  by  medically
  acceptable  clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques, and which are
  expected to be permanent and which prevent the tenant from  engaging  in
  any substantial gainful employment; or
    (2)  The  landlord  seeks  in  good  faith  to recover possession of a
  housing accommodation for which  the  tenant's  lease  or  other  rental
  agreement  has  expired  or  otherwise  terminated,  and  at the time of
  termination the occupants of the housing accommodation are subtenants or
  other persons who occupied under a rental agreement with the tenant, and
  no part of the accommodation is  used  by  the  tenant  as  his  or  her
  dwelling; or
    (3)  The  landlord  seeks  in  good  faith  to recover possession of a
  housing  accommodation  for  the  immediate  purpose  of   substantially
  altering or remodeling it, provided that the landlord shall have secured
  such  approval  therefor  as is required by law and the city rent agency
  determines that the issuance of the order granting  the  certificate  of
  eviction is not inconsistent with the purpose of this chapter; or
    (4)  The landlord seeks in good faith to recover possession of housing
  accommodations for the immediate purpose of demolishing  them,  and  the
  city  rent  agency determines that such demolition is to be effected for
  the purpose of constructing a new building, provided that:
    (a) If the purpose of such demolition is to construct a  new  building
  containing  housing  accommodations, no certificate of eviction shall be
  granted under this paragraph unless such agency determines that such new
  building  will  contain  at  least  twenty  per  centum   more   housing
  accommodations  consisting of self-contained family units (as defined by
  regulations issued by such agency, with due regard for the  shortage  of
  housing  accommodations  suitable  for  family  occupancy  and  for  the
  purposes of this chapter in relation thereto) than are contained in  the
  structure  to  be demolished; except, however, that where as a result of
  conditions detrimental to life or health of the tenants, violations have

  been placed upon the structure containing the housing accommodations  by
  any  agency  of  the  city having jurisdiction over such matters and the
  cost of removing such violations would  be  substantially  equal  to  or
  would  exceed  the assessed valuation of the structure, the new building
  shall only be required to make provision for a greater number of housing
  accommodations consisting of self-contained family units (as so  defined
  by regulation) than are contained in the structure to be demolished; and
    (b)  The  city rent agency shall, by regulation, as a condition to the
  granting of certificates of eviction under this paragraph,  require  the
  relocation  of  the  tenants  in other suitable accommodations, provided
  that the city rent agency may, by regulation, authorize the granting  of
  such  certificates  as to any tenants or classes of tenants without such
  requirement of relocation, where  such  exemption  will  not  result  in
  hardship  to  such  tenants  or  classes  of  tenants  and  will  not be
  inconsistent with the purposes of this chapter; and
    (c) The city rent agency may, by regulation, in order to carry out the
  purposes of this chapter, impose additional conditions to  the  granting
  of  certificates  of  eviction  under this paragraph, including, but not
  limited to, the payment of stipends to the tenants by  the  landlord  in
  such  amounts and subject to such variations and classifications as such
  agency may determine to be reasonably necessary; and
    (d) No certificate of  eviction  shall  be  issued  pursuant  to  this
  paragraph  unless  the  landlord  shall have secured such approval as is
  required by law for the construction sought to be effected, and the city
  rent agency determines that the issuance  of  such  certificate  is  not
  inconsistent with the purpose of this chapter.
    (5)  Notwithstanding  any provisions to the contrary contained in this
  subdivision or in subdivision d of section 26-410 of this chapter or  in
  the local emergency housing rent control act:
    (a) no application for a certificate of eviction under paragraph three
  or  four  of  this  subdivision  and no application for a certificate of
  eviction under paragraph one of subdivision j or under subdivision c  of
  this section for the purpose of withdrawing a housing accommodation from
  the  housing  market on the grounds that the continued operation of such
  housing accommodation would impose undue  hardship  upon  the  landlord,
  pending  or  made on or after the effective date hereof shall be granted
  by the city rent agency unless the city rent agency finds that there  is
  no reasonable possibility that the landlord can make a net annual return
  of  eight  and  one-half per centum of the assessed value of the subject
  property without recourse to the remedy provided in said paragraph three
  or four or said subdivision c or j and finds that neither  the  landlord
  nor  his  or  her immediate predecessor in interest has intentionally or
  willfully managed the property to impair the landlord's ability to  earn
  such return; and
    (b)  the  effectiveness of any certificate of eviction or of any order
  granting a certificate of eviction pursuant to paragraphs three and four
  of this subdivision shall be suspended, and no  tenant  may  be  evicted
  pursuant to any such certificate or order, unless the city rent agency:
    (i)  finds  that  there is no reasonable possibility that the landlord
  can make a net annual return of eight and one-half  per  centum  of  the
  assessed  value  of  the subject property without recourse to the remedy
  provided in said paragraphs three and four and finds  that  neither  the
  landlord   nor   his  or  her  immediate  predecessor  in  interest  has
  intentionally or willfully managed the property to impair the landlord's
  ability to earn such return; and
    (ii) issues an order reinstating the effectiveness of any  certificate
  of  eviction  suspended  pursuant to this paragraph. The pendency of any

  judicial proceeding or appeal shall in no way prevent the taking  effect
  of the relief granted in this subparagraph.
    (c) the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to an application
  for  a  certificate  of  eviction  from a housing accommodation when the
  landlord seeks in good faith  to  recover  possession  thereof  for  the
  immediate purpose of substantially altering or remodelling it or for the
  immediate  purpose  of  demolishing it for the purpose of constructing a
  new building when such altering or remodelling or  the  construction  of
  such  new  building  is to be aided by interest reduction payments under
  section two hundred thirty-six of the national housing act.
    (6) Neither the provisions of subparagraph (a) of  paragraph  four  of
  this  subdivision, which require that the new building contain more than
  or equal to the number of housing accommodations that are  contained  in
  the structure to be demolished or substantially altered or remodeled nor
  the  provisions  of  paragraph five of this subdivision shall apply with
  respect to any building in  which  there  remains  (A)  three  or  fewer
  occupied  apartments  which  constitute ten percent or less of the total
  dwelling units in the building or (B)  one  occupied  apartment  if  the
  building contains ten or fewer apartments but only on the condition that
  the  tenant is provided with the relocation, moving expense, stipend and
  any other benefits provided under the corresponding  provisions  of  the
  rent stabilization law of nineteen hundred sixty-nine. In the event of a
  substantial  alteration  or  remodeling of a building falling within the
  limitations  of  this  paragraph,  all  of  the  relocation   provisions
  available to an owner for demolition shall apply.
    c.  The  city  rent  agency  may  from time to time, to effectuate the
  purposes of this chapter,  adopt,  promulgate,  amend  or  rescind  such
  rules,  regulations or orders as it may deem necessary or proper for the
  control of evictions. Any such rules, regulations or orders may include,
  in addition to any other  provisions  authorized  by  this  subdivision,
  provisions  restricting  the filing of applications for, or the issuance
  of orders granting, certificates of eviction  where  such  agency  finds
  that  a  course  of  conduct  has been engaged in which is proscribed by
  subdivision d of section 26-412 of this chapter. The agency  shall  also
  require,  prior  to the filing of plans with the department of buildings
  for a new building or alteration  on  the  site  of  controlled  housing
  accommodations  and  prior  to the filing of an application for a permit
  for the demolition or removal of an  existing  multiple  dwelling  which
  contains  controlled  housing accommodations, that the applicant certify
  to and file with the agency such information and  give  such  notice  to
  tenants  as  it  deems  necessary  to  prevent  evasion  of  the law and
  regulations governing evictions. It  may  also  require  that  an  order
  granting  a  certificate  of  eviction  be obtained from it prior to the
  institution of any action or proceeding for the recovery  of  possession
  of  any housing accommodation subject to rent control under this chapter
  upon the grounds specified in subdivision b of this section or where  it
  finds  that  the  requested removal or eviction is not inconsistent with
  the purposes of this chapter and  would  not  be  likely  to  result  in
  circumvention  or evasion thereof; provided, however, that no such order
  shall be required in any action or proceeding brought  pursuant  to  the
  provisions of subdivision a of this section.
    d.  (1)  The city rent agency, on its own initiative or on application
  of a tenant, may revoke or cancel an order  granting  a  certificate  of
  eviction  at  any  time prior to the execution of a warrant in a summary
  proceeding to recover possession of real property by a court whenever it
  finds that:
    (a) The certificate of eviction was obtained by fraud  or  illegality;
  or

    (b)  The  landlord's  intentions or circumstances have so changed that
  the premises, possession of which is sought, will not be  used  for  the
  purpose specified in the certificate.
    (2) The commencement of a proceeding by the city rent agency to revoke
  or  cancel  an  order granting a certificate of eviction shall stay such
  order until the final determination  of  the  proceeding  regardless  of
  whether  the  waiting  period  in  the order has already expired. In the
  event the city rent agency cancels or revokes such an order,  the  court
  having  jurisdiction  of  any summary proceeding instituted in such case
  shall take appropriate action to dismiss the application for removal  of
  the  tenant  from  the  real  property and to vacate and annul any final
  order or warrant granted or issued by the court in the matter.
    e. Notwithstanding the  preceding  provisions  of  this  section,  the
  state,  the  city,  or  the  New York city housing authority may recover
  possession of any housing  accommodations  operated  by  it  where  such
  action or proceeding is authorized by statute or regulations under which
  such accommodations are administered.
    f.  Any  order  of  the city rent agency under this section granting a
  certificate of eviction shall be subject to judicial review only in  the
  manner  prescribed  by  subdivision  eight  of  section one of the state
  enabling act and sections 26-410 and 26-411 of this chapter.
    g. (1) Where after the city rent agency has granted a  certificate  of
  eviction authorizing the landlord to pursue his or her remedies pursuant
  to  law  to  acquire  possession and a tenant voluntarily removes from a
  housing accommodation  or  has  been  removed  therefrom  by  action  or
  proceeding   to   evict   from   or  recover  possession  of  a  housing
  accommodation upon the ground that the landlord seeks in good  faith  to
  recover possession of such accommodation:
    (a)  For  his  or her immediate and personal use, or for the immediate
  and personal use by a member or members of his or her immediate  family,
  and  such  landlord or members of his or her immediate family shall fail
  to occupy  such  accommodation  within  thirty  days  after  the  tenant
  vacates,  or  such  landlord  shall  lease  or rent such space or permit
  occupancy thereof by a third person within a period of  one  year  after
  such removal of the tenant; or
    (b)   For   the   immediate   purpose   of  withdrawing  such  housing
  accommodation from the rental market and such landlord  shall  lease  or
  sell the housing accommodation or the space previously occupied thereby,
  or  permit  use  thereof  in  a  manner  other than contemplated in such
  eviction certificate within a period of one year after such  removal  of
  the tenant; or
    (c)  For  the immediate purpose of altering or remodeling such housing
  accommodation, and  the  landlord  shall  fail  to  start  the  work  of
  alteration  or  remodeling  of  such housing accommodation within ninety
  days after the removal, on the ground that he or she required possession
  for the purpose of effecting such alteration or remodeling, of the  last
  tenant  whose removal is necessary to enable the landlord to effect such
  alteration or remodeling of  such  accommodation,  or  if  after  having
  commenced  such  work  shall  fail or neglect to prosecute the work with
  reasonable diligence; or
    (d)  For  the  immediate   purpose   of   demolishing   such   housing
  accommodations  and  constructing  a  new  building  in  accordance with
  approved plans, or reasonable amendment thereof, and  the  landlord  has
  failed to complete the demolition within six months after the removal of
  the  last  tenant  or,  having  demolished  the  premises, has failed or
  neglected to proceed with the new construction within ninety days  after
  the completion of such demolition, or having commenced such construction

  work  has  failed  or  neglected  to prosecute such work with reasonable
  diligence; or
    (e)  For  some  purpose other than those specified above for which the
  removal of the tenant was sought and the landlord has failed to use  the
  vacated  premises for such purpose; such landlord shall, unless for good
  cause shown, be liable  to  the  tenant  for  three  times  the  damages
  sustained on account of such removal plus reasonable attorney's fees and
  costs  as  determined by the court. In addition to any other damage, the
  cost of removal of property shall be a lawful  measure  of  damage.  The
  remedy herein provided for shall be in addition to those provided for in
  subdivision  h  of  this  section,  paragraph  (a) of subdivision ten of
  section one of the state enabling  act  and  subdivision  a  of  section
  26-413 of this chapter.
    (2)  The  acts and omissions mentioned in subparagraphs (a), (b), (c),
  (d) and (e) of paragraph one of this  subdivision,  on  the  part  of  a
  landlord  after  issuance  of  a  certificate  of  eviction,  are hereby
  declared to be inconsistent with the purposes for which such certificate
  of eviction was issued.
    h. Where after the city rent  agency  has  granted  a  certificate  of
  eviction authorizing the landlord to pursue his or her remedies pursuant
  to  law to acquire possession for any purpose stated in subdivision b or
  j of this section or  for  some  other  stated  purpose,  and  a  tenant
  voluntarily  removes  from  a  housing accommodation or has been removed
  therefrom by action or proceeding to evict from or recover possession of
  a housing accommodation and the landlord or any  successor  landlord  of
  the  premises  does  not  use  the housing accommodation for the purpose
  specified in such certificate of eviction, the vacated accommodation  or
  any  replacement  or  subdivision  thereof  shall,  unless the city rent
  agency  approves  such  different   purpose,   be   deemed   a   housing
  accommodation subject to control, notwithstanding any definition of that
  term  in  this  chapter  to the contrary. Such approval shall be granted
  whenever the city rent agency finds that the failure or omission to  use
  the  housing accommodation for the purpose specified in such certificate
  was not inconsistent with the purpose of this chapter and would  not  be
  likely  to  result  in  the circumvention or evasion thereof. The remedy
  herein provided for shall be  in  addition  to  those  provided  for  in
  subdivision  g  of  this  section,  paragraph  (a) of subdivision ten of
  section one of the state enabling  act  and  subdivision  a  of  section
  26-413 of this chapter.
    i.  Any  statutory  tenant who vacates a housing accommodation without
  giving the landlord at least thirty days' written notice  by  registered
  or  certified mail of his or her intention to vacate, shall be liable to
  the landlord for the loss of rent suffered  by  the  landlord,  but  not
  exceeding  one month's rent, except where the tenant has been removed or
  vacates pursuant to the provisions of this section. Such notice shall be
  postmarked on or before the last day of the  rental  period  immediately
  prior to such thirty-day period.
    j.  (1)  Nothing  in  this  chapter  shall be construed to require any
  person to  offer  any  housing  accommodations  for  rent,  but  housing
  accommodations  already on the rental market may be withdrawn only after
  prior written approval of the  city  rent  agency,  if  such  withdrawal
  requires that a tenant be evicted from such accommodations.
    (2)  The  city rent agency, in order to carry out the purposes of this
  chapter, may issue regulations providing for issuance of certificates of
  eviction in any case where the landlord seeks such approval in order  to
  use the premises (including the building or land) (a) for the purpose of
  conducting a business, or (b) where the landlord is a hospital, convent,
  asylum,  public institution, college, school or any institution operated

  exclusively for charitable, religious or educational purposes on  a  non
  profit  basis  and  the landlord seeks such approval in order to use the
  premises (including the  building  or  land)  or  any  part  thereof  in
  connection  with  the  landlord's  charitable,  religious or educational
  purposes; such agency, if it grants approval, shall condition same  upon
  compliance  by  the  landlord  with  designated  requirements  which may
  consist of any conditions that  such  agency  would  have  authority  to
  prescribe  by  regulation  under  subparagraphs (b) and (c) of paragraph
  four of subdivision b of this section with respect to  applications  for
  certificates  of  eviction  under such paragraph four provided, however,
  that such agency shall not condition any  such  approval  granted  to  a
  hospital,  convent,  asylum, public institution, college, school, or any
  institution  operated   exclusively   for   charitable,   religious   or
  educational purposes upon compliance with requirements exceeding or less
  than  those  applicable  to  any private owner in similar circumstances.
  Nothing contained in this paragraph shall be construed as authorizing or
  requiring  such  agency  to  approve  the  withdrawal  of  any   housing
  accommodations from the rental market by any landlord for the purpose of
  using  the  premises  for  any  business other than one in existence and
  conducted by such landlord at the time such  withdrawal  is  sought.  No
  certificate  of eviction shall be issued to a nonprofit school, college,
  hospital, or other charitable institution, including without limitation,
  any organization exempt from taxation under the Federal Internal Revenue
  Code, which seeks to recover possession of the housing accommodations or
  to withdraw such accommodations from the rental  or  non-rental  housing
  market,  for  immediate  and  personal  use  and  occupancy  as  housing
  accommodations by its employees, students or members of its staff.
    k. The city rent agency by order issued pursuant  to  its  regulations
  may  waive  the  requirements of subdivision b of this section where (1)
  the housing accommodations were vacant at the time  when  landlord  made
  application  for such waiver, and (2) were vacated by reason of the last
  tenant's voluntary surrender thereof, and  (3)  the  landlord,  in  good
  faith, intends to demolish or substantially rehabilitate the building in
  which the housing accommodations are located within a period approved by
  the  city  rent  agency.  The failure of the landlord to comply with the
  conditions established by the city rent agency for the granting  of  the
  application   shall  subject  the  housing  accommodations  to  all  the
  provisions of this chapter.
