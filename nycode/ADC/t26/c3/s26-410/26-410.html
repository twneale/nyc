Section 26-410

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  26-410  Procedure. a. After the issuance of any regulation or order
  by the city rent agency, any person subject to  any  provision  of  such
  regulation or order may, in accordance with regulations to be prescribed
  by  such  agency,  file  a  protest  against  such  regulation  or order
  specifically setting forth his or her objections to any such  provisions
  and  affidavits or other written evidence in support of such objections.
  Statements in support of any such regulation or order  may  be  received
  and  incorporated  in the record of the proceedings at such times and in
  accordance with such regulations as may be prescribed  by  such  agency.
  Within  a  reasonable  time  after  the filing of any protest under this
  section, such agency shall either grant or deny such protest in whole or
  in part, notice such protest for hearing, or provide an  opportunity  to
  present further evidence in connection therewith. In the event that such
  agency  denies any such protest in whole or in part, it shall inform the
  protestant of the grounds upon which such decision is based, and of  any
  economic data and other facts of which it has taken official notice.
    b.  In  the  administration  of this chapter, the city rent agency may
  take official notice of economic data and other facts,  including  facts
  found  by  it  as  a result of action taken under section 26-405 of this
  chapter.
    c. Any proceedings under this section may be limited by the city  rent
  agency  to  the filing of affidavits, or other written evidence, and the
  filing of briefs, except that no  multiple-tenant  initiated  proceeding
  for  the  reduction  of  rents in a building may be determined without a
  hearing.
    d. Any protest filed under this section shall be granted or denied  by
  the city rent agency, or granted in part and the remainder of it denied,
  within  a reasonable time after it is filed. If such agency does not act
  finally within a period of ninety days after the protest is  filed,  the
  protest shall be deemed to be denied. However, such agency may grant one
  extension not to exceed thirty days with the consent of the party filing
  such protest; any further extension may only be granted with the consent
  of  all parties to the protest. No proceeding may be brought pursuant to
  article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules  to  challenge
  any  order or determination which is subject to such protest unless such
  review has been sought and either (1) a determination thereon  has  been
  made  or  (2)  the  ninety-day  period provided for determination of the
  protest (or any extension thereof) has expired. If such agency does  not
  act  finally  within a period of ninety days after the entry of an order
  of remand to such  agency  by  the  court  in  a  proceeding  instituted
  pursuant  to  subdivision eight of section one of the state enabling act
  or section 26-411 of this chapter, the order  previously  made  by  such
  agency  shall  be  deemed reaffirmed. However, such agency may grant one
  extension not to exceed thirty days with the consent of the  petitioner;
  any  further  extension  may  only  be  granted  with the consent of all
  parties to the petition.
    e. The city rent agency shall compile and make  available  for  public
  inspection  at  reasonable  hours  at  its  principal office and at each
  appropriate local office a copy of each decision  rendered  by  it  upon
  granting, or denying, in whole or in part, any protests filed under this
  section  and  shall  have  available  at each appropriate local office a
  register of properties concerning which a vacate order was issued  by  a
  city  department having jurisdiction or proceedings have been brought to
  determine whether any housing accommodations therein became vacant as  a
  result  of conduct proscribed by subdivision d of section 26-412 of this
  chapter.
