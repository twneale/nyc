Section 26-811

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  26-811  Penalty.  An  owner found to have violated any provision of
  this chapter shall, in addition to any other monetary  and/or  equitable
  damages for which the owner may be liable, be liable for a civil penalty
  of  five  thousand  dollars  per month per dwelling unit in the assisted
  rental housing, and shall also pay to a tenant  association,  or  if  no
  tenant  association  exists,  each tenant, or if applicable, a qualified
  entity, fees and costs incurred in bringing an  enforcement  proceeding.
  The  total  civil  penalties may not exceed one hundred thousand dollars
  per dwelling unit. Nothing in  this  section  shall  be  interpreted  as
  prohibiting  the tenant association, or if no tenant association exists,
  the  tenants,  or  if  applicable,  a  qualified  entity,  from  seeking
  injunctive  relief  against a non-compliant owner. Such proceeding shall
  be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction.
