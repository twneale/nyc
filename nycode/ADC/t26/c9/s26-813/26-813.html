Section 26-813

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 26-813  Judicial  Review.  Any  person  aggrieved  by  an  appraisal
  determination made pursuant to section 26-804 of this chapter, or by the
  failure of the department to approve a bona fide offer to purchase, may,
  within thirty days of the  appraisal  determination  or  action  by  the
  department,  seek  judicial  review pursuant to article seventy-eight of
  the civil practice law and rules in the supreme court for the county  in
  which  the assisted rental housing is located. In the event that a court
  may find that the appraisal or action by the department constitutes  the
  equivalent  of  a  taking  without  just  compensation,  the court shall
  require that a new appraisal or determination be made. The time  periods
  set  forth in this chapter shall be tolled during the pendency of such a
  proceeding and until a new appraisal or  determination,  if  needed,  is
  made.
