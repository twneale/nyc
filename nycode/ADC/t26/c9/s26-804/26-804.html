Section 26-804

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  26-804 Appraisal determination. (a) The department shall convene an
  advisory panel, which advisory panel shall determine the appraised value
  of  the  assisted  rental  housing  within  thirty  days  of  a   tenant
  association's,  or  if  applicable,  a  qualified entity's notice to the
  owner and the department pursuant to subdivision a of section 26-805  or
  subdivision a of section 26-806 of this chapter.
    (b)  The advisory panel shall consist of one appraiser selected by the
  owner,  one  appraiser  selected  by  the  tenant  association,  or   if
  applicable,  a qualified entity, and one appraiser to be selected either
  by mutual agreement between the owner and the tenant association  or  if
  applicable,  a  qualified  entity,  or  by  mutual agreement between the
  appraiser that was selected by the owner and the appraiser  selected  by
  the  tenant  association,  or if applicable, a qualified entity, if such
  condition is deemed acceptable to the owner and the tenants association,
  or if applicable, a qualified entity, and is  agreed  upon  in  writing,
  except that in the case of where there is no agreement between the owner
  and  the  tenant  association,  or if applicable, a qualified entity, or
  between the appraiser that was selected by the owner and  the  appraiser
  selected  by  the  tenant  association,  or  if  applicable, a qualified
  entity, then the appraiser will be selected by the department. The  cost
  for  the appraiser shall be borne by the party responsible for providing
  such appraiser. However, where the  department  must  select  the  third
  appraiser,  the  cost  for  such appraiser shall be equally borne by the
  owner and the tenant association, or if applicable, a qualified entity.
    (c) Notice shall be provided by the department to the  owner  and  the
  tenant  association,  or if applicable, a qualified entity, fifteen days
  before the intended date that such advisory panel  is  to  initiate  the
  performance  of  the  appraisal.  In  the instance when either the owner
  fails to provide an appraiser within fifteen days of such notice or when
  the tenant association, or if applicable, a qualified entity,  fails  to
  provide  an  appraiser  within  fifteen  days  of  such  notice then the
  department shall select the appraiser on behalf of the party or  parties
  that  failed  to select an appraiser. In such circumstance, the cost for
  the appraiser selected by the department shall be  borne  by  the  party
  responsible for providing that appraiser.
    (d) The department shall promulgate rules for the timely determination
  of the appraised value and that such rules are to be consistent with the
  notice  requirements  mandated  under this chapter. The department shall
  make such appraised value publicly available within  fifteen  days  from
  the date of such advisory panel's determination.
    (e)  In the instance where the owner and the tenant association, or if
  applicable, a qualified entity, have mutually agreed upon  an  appraised
  value  for  the  assisted  rental  housing prior to the convening of the
  advisory panel, the owner and the tenant association, or if  applicable,
  a  qualified entity, may in writing apply to the department for a waiver
  from subdivisions a through d of this section. The department shall make
  a determination upon such application for a waiver within  fifteen  days
  from receipt of such application.
