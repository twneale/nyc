Section 26-805

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  26-805  Right  of  first  refusal.  (a) A tenant association, or if
  applicable,  a  qualified  entity,  shall  notify  the  owner  and   the
  department  in  writing  of  its  intent  to exercise its right of first
  refusal within sixty days from receipt of notice from the owner pursuant
  to subdivision a of section 26-802 of this chapter.
    (b) The tenant association, or  if  applicable,  a  qualified  entity,
  following  notice  by  the  owner  in  compliance  with subdivision a of
  section 26-802 of this chapter, shall have one hundred twenty days  from
  the  date  of  the notice of the determination of the appraised value to
  submit its offer to purchase.
    (c) The tenant association, or  if  applicable,  a  qualified  entity,
  following  notice  by  the  owner  in  compliance  with subdivision a of
  section 26-803 of this chapter, shall have one hundred twenty days  from
  the  date  of  a  bona  fide  offer  to  purchase to submit its offer to
  purchase.
    (d) If through no fault of a tenant association, or if  applicable,  a
  qualified  entity,  or  the  owner,  the  time  periods  provided for in
  subdivisions b or c of this section need to be extended, then such  time
  periods  may  be  extended by the department. Should such time period be
  extended past the notice period provided for in subdivision a of section
  26-802 of this chapter, then the provisions of the  applicable  assisted
  rental  housing  program  shall  remain  in full force and effect to the
  extent permitted by law.
    (e) Unless the owner and a tenant association,  or  if  applicable,  a
  qualified  entity,  otherwise  agree  to  purchase  the  assisted rental
  housing below its appraised value, the owner shall  sell  such  assisted
  rental  housing  at  the  appraised value or at the price contained in a
  bona fide offer to purchase price as approved by the department.
    (f) The department shall promulgate rules for the timely completion of
  all lending program applications, credit reviews and loan closings.
    (g) If a tenant association, or if  applicable,  a  qualified  entity,
  does  not  submit  its  offer in writing to the owner and the department
  within the time periods stated in subdivisions b or c  of  this  section
  following  notice  by  the  owner  in  compliance  with subdivision a of
  section 26-802 of this chapter, then such right will  be  deemed  waived
  and  the  owner  shall  have  no further obligations under this section.
  However, where a tenant  association,  or  if  applicable,  a  qualified
  entity, has previously submitted a notice in accordance with subdivision
  a  of  this  section decides not to exercise such right, it may withdraw
  such notice by giving written notice to that effect to the owner and  to
  the department.
