Section 7-615

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  7-615  Corrections  to be without erasures. No entry in any book or
  index in the register's office or the office of the clerk of the  county
  of  Richmond  shall  be erased so as to be illegible, but in case of any
  correction the same shall be made without destroying the original  entry
  by drawing a line through such original entry, and in all such cases the
  date  of  such  correction attested by the signature of such register or
  county clerk or his or her assistant shall be entered upon the same page
  on  which  such  correction  is  made,  on  the  margin  opposite   such
  correction.  Such  correction  shall only be made upon the production to
  the register or county clerk of the original instrument, or, when it  is
  impossible  to  produce  the  original  instrument,  the register or the
  county clerk, however, may make any correction of the records in his  or
  her  office  where it is obvious or apparent that an error has been made
  in recording or indexing any instrument.
