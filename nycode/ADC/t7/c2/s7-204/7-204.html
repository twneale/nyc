<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  7-204 Settlement of claims. The commissioner of finance may require
  any person presenting for settlement a claim in relation to  excise  and
  non-property  taxes against the city to be sworn before the commissioner
  of finance, any of the deputy commissioners of finance, or  any  officer
  or  employee  of  the  department  of  finance  or of the law department
  designated in a written instrument by the commissioner  of  finance  and
  filed  in  the office of the commissioner, touching such claim, and when
  so sworn, to answer orally as to any facts relative to the  justness  of
  such  claim.  Wilful  false swearing before the commissioner of finance,
  any deputy commissioner or officer or  employee  designated  to  conduct
  such  oral  examination  is perjury and punishable as such. In adjusting
  and settling such  claims,  the  commissioner  of  finance,  as  far  as
  practicable,  shall  be  governed  by the rules of law and principles of
  equity which prevail in courts of justice.
