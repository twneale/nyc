  eligible  business relocates on or after July first, two thousand three,
  the highest number of aggregate employment  shares  maintained  by  such
  eligible business in such premises in the taxable year during which such

  amounts for each particular eligible premises;
    (ii)  If  in  a taxable year, the sum for all eligible premises of the
  lesser of the amounts determined pursuant to paragraphs one and  two  of

    (2) "Excess shares" shall mean eligible  aggregate  employment  shares
  that  are apportioned pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision to a
  relocation in excess of the limitation amount defined  in  subparagraphs
  (i) and (ii) of this paragraph for such relocation.

  the eligible area in the taxable year immediately preceding such year of
  relocation; or
    (B) for one or more relocations in a specified year of relocation that
  is  not  the latest such year of relocation by an eligible business, the
  amount, if any, by which  the  number  of  aggregate  employment  shares
  maintained  by the eligible business in the eligible area in the taxable
  year in which it is claiming  the  credit  authorized  by  this  chapter
  exceeds the sum of (I) the number of total attributed eligible aggregate
  employment  shares  that are attributed in the taxable year in which the
  credit is claimed to relocations that took place in years of  relocation
  later  than  the  specified  year  of  relocation and (II) the number of
  aggregate employment shares maintained by it in the eligible area in the
  taxable year immediately preceding such specified year of relocation.
    (ii) In the case of an eligible business that has relocated more  than
  once  in  the  same  taxable  year,  the limitation amount determined in
  accordance with subparagraph (i) of this paragraph shall be  applied  to
  such  relocations  in  the  same  proportion  as  the eligible aggregate
  employment shares apportioned to such relocations pursuant to  paragraph
  one of this subdivision.
    (3)(i)  In  any  taxable  year  in which there are excess shares, such
  excess shares, or a portion thereof, from a  relocation  or  relocations

  earlier years of relocation.

  number  of  eligible aggregate employment shares apportioned pursuant to

  paragraph one of this subdivision to such  relocation  for  the  taxable
  year  in  which the credit is claimed is less than the highest number of
  total attributed eligible aggregate employment shares pertaining to such
  relocation  in  any  taxable year prior to the taxable year in which the
  credit is claimed;
    (B) the sum of the number of  shares  attributed  to  such  relocation
  pursuant  to  subparagraph  (i)  of  this  paragraph  and  the  eligible
  aggregate employment shares apportioned to any such relocation  pursuant
  to  paragraph one of this subdivision may not exceed such highest number
  of total attributed eligible aggregate employment shares; and
    (C) such sum may not exceed the limitation amount for such  relocation
  defined in paragraph two of this subdivision.
    (4)  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  other  paragraphs  of  this
  subdivision,  any  excess  shares  that  are  apportioned  pursuant   to
  paragraph one of this subdivision to a relocation to particular eligible
  premises  that  are  not  located in a revitalization area as defined in
  subdivision  (n)  of  this  section,  but  are  attributed  pursuant  to
  paragraph three of this subdivision to particular eligible premises that
  are  located  in such a revitalization area, shall be treated as if such
  premises to which they are attributed were not in such a  revitalization
  area.

  provided for in this  chapter,  and  (ii)  with  regard  to  which  such
  eligible  business obtains the certification provided for in subdivision
