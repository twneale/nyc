<pre>
    
 
    &sect;   22-622.   Authorization   to  provide  relocation  and  employment
  assistance credits.
    (a) An eligible business that relocates as defined in subdivision  (j)
  of  section  22-621  of  the  code  shall be allowed to receive a credit
  against a tax imposed by chapter five, or subchapter  two  or  three  of
  chapter  six,  or  chapter  eleven,  of  title  eleven  of  the code, as
  described in subdivision (i) of section 11-503, subdivision seventeen of
  section 11-604, section 11-643.7 and section 11-1105.2 of the code,  and
  a reduction in base rent subject to tax as described in subdivision f of
  section 11-704 of the code, provided, however, notwithstanding any other
  provision  of  law  to  the  contrary,  no  such credit shall be allowed
  against the tax imposed under  such  chapter  eleven  for  a  relocation
  taking place prior to January first, nineteen hundred ninety-nine.
    (b)  No  eligible  business  shall  be  authorized to receive a credit
  against tax or a reduction  in  base  rent  subject  to  tax  under  the
  provisions of this chapter, and of title eleven of the code as described
  in  subdivision  (a) of this section, until the premises with respect to
  which it is claiming the credit meet the requirements in the  definition
  of  eligible  premises  and  until  it  has  obtained a certification of
  eligibility from the mayor or an agency designated by the mayor, and  an
  annual certification from the mayor or an agency designated by the mayor
  as  to  the number of eligible aggregate employment shares maintained by
  such eligible business that may qualify for obtaining a tax  credit  for
  the eligible business' taxable year. Any written documentation submitted
  to  the  mayor  or  such  agency or agencies in order to obtain any such
  certification shall be deemed  a  written  instrument  for  purposes  of
  section   175.00   of   the   penal   law.  Application  fees  for  such
  certifications shall be determined  by  the  mayor  or  such  agency  or
  agencies. No certification of eligibility shall be issued to an eligible
  business on or after July first, two thousand thirteen unless:
    (1)  prior to such date such business has purchased, leased or entered
  into a contract to purchase or lease particular premises or a parcel  on
  which  will  be constructed such premises or already owned such premises
  or parcel;
    (2) prior to such  date  improvements  have  been  commenced  on  such
  premises  or  parcel  which  improvements  will meet the requirements of
  subdivision  (e)  of  section  22-621  of  this  chapter   relating   to
  expenditures for improvements;
    (3) prior to such date such business submits a preliminary application
  for  a  certification  of  eligibility  to  such mayor or such agency or
  agencies with respect  to  a  proposed  relocation  to  such  particular
  premises; and
    (4) such business relocates to such particular premises not later than
  thirty-six  months  or,  in  a  case  in which the expenditures made for
  improvements specified in paragraph  two  of  this  subdivision  are  in
  excess  of fifty million dollars within seventy-two months from the date
  of submission of such preliminary application.
    (c) The mayor or an agency or agencies designated by the  mayor  shall
  be  authorized  to  promulgate  rules  and regulations to administer and
  assure compliance with the provisions of this chapter, including but not
  limited to rules and regulations to provide for alternative  methods  to
  measure employment shares in instances where an eligible business is not
  required  by  law to maintain weekly records of full-time work weeks and
  part-time work weeks of  employees,  partners  or  sole  proprietors  as
  defined in subdivision (g) of section 22-621 of this chapter.
    (d)  An  eligible business other than a utility company subject to the
  supervision of the department of public service shall not be  authorized
  to receive a credit against the gross receipts tax imposed under chapter

  eleven of title eleven of the code, unless such eligible business elects
  to take the credit authorized by this section against the tax imposed by
  such  chapter  on  an  application  filed  with  respect  to  the  first
  relocation  of  such  business that qualifies or will qualify under this
  section, with the mayor or the agency designated by such mayor  pursuant
  to  subdivision  (b)  of  this  section. The election authorized by this
  subdivision  may  not  be  withdrawn  after   the   issuance   of   such
  certification of eligibility. No taxpayer that has previously received a
  certification  of  eligibility  to  receive  such credit against any tax
  imposed by chapter five or subchapter two or three  of  chapter  six  of
  title  eleven  of  the  code  may  make  the election authorized by this
  subdivision. No taxpayer  that  makes  the  election  provided  in  this
  subdivision  shall  be  authorized  to  take such credit against any tax
  imposed by chapter five or subchapter two or three  of  chapter  six  of
  title eleven of the code.
    (e)  Notwithstanding  other  provisions  of  this chapter, an eligible
  business that has obtained pursuant to subdivision (b) of this section a
  certification of eligibility for a  relocation  to  particular  eligible
  premises  may apply to the mayor of such city or an agency designated by
  such mayor to have premises in a building, other than  the  building  in
  which  such  particular  eligible  premises  are  located,  certified as
  designated additional or replacement premises as defined in  subdivision
  (q)  of section 22-621 of this chapter. After the certification provided
  for in this subdivision has  been  obtained,  any  aggregate  employment
  shares  maintained  by  the  eligible business in such premises shall be
  treated as if such employment shares were maintained in  the  particular
  premises to which the eligible business relocated. No such certification
  shall  be issued after the end of the period during which the credit may
  be taken with regard to  the  relocation  to  such  particular  eligible
  premises,  and  the issuance of such certification shall not extend such
  period. Provided,  however,  (i)  no  premises  shall  be  certified  as
  designated  additional  or replacement premises if the eligible business
  maintained employment shares in such premises prior to  the  application
  for  certification  provided  for  in this subdivision, (ii) no premises
  shall be certified as  designated  additional  or  replacement  premises
  unless  such  premises  meet  the  requirements for eligible premises in
  subdivision (e) of section 22-621 of this  chapter,  and  (iii)  if  the
  particular  premises  to  which the eligible business relocated are in a
  revitalization zone,  no  premises  shall  be  certified  as  designated
  additional or replacement premises with regard to such relocation unless
  such  designated  additional  or  replacement  premises are located in a
  revitalization zone.
    (f)(1)(i) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (i) of section
  22-621 of this chapter, in the case of an eligible business meeting  the
  criteria in subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) of this paragraph, the mayor or
  his  or her designee, in his or her discretion, may for any taxable year
  in which such business is eligible to receive the credit provided for in
  this section, determine the  number  of  eligible  aggregate  employment
  shares as provided in paragraph two of this subdivision, and such number
  shall be deemed to be the number of eligible aggregate employment shares
  determined  pursuant  to  such subdivision (i) of section 22-621 for the
  purpose of attributing shares pursuant to  subdivision  (o)  of  section
  22-621  of  this chapter to relocations as defined in subdivision (j) of
  such section 22-621 occurring after July first, two thousand three:
    (ii) in the case of a relocation before July first, two thousand five,
  in the taxable year prior to its first relocation after July first,  two
  thousand three (such prior year being hereafter referred to as the "base
  year"),   such  eligible  business  maintained  more  than  one  hundred

  aggregate employment shares in the  eligible  Lower  Manhattan  area  as
  defined  in  subdivision  (f)  of section 22-623 of this title, provided
  that in the case of a relocation  after  June  thirtieth,  two  thousand
  five,  in the taxable year prior to its first relocation after such date
  (such prior year being hereafter referred to as the "base  year"),  such
  eligible  business maintained one or more aggregate employment shares in
  such eligible Lower Manhattan area, and
    (iii) in the case of a relocation  before  July  first,  two  thousand
  five,  in  the  taxable  year  subsequent to the base year for which the
  determination of eligible aggregate employment shares is being made, the
  number of aggregate employment shares in the  eligible  Lower  Manhattan
  area  maintained  by  the  eligible  business is less than the number of
  aggregate employment shares it maintained in such area in the base  year
  reduced  by one hundred, provided that in the case of a relocation after
  June thirtieth, two thousand five, in the taxable year subsequent to the
  base year for which the determination of eligible  aggregate  employment
  shares  is  being made, the number of aggregate employment shares in the
  eligible Lower Manhattan area maintained by  the  eligible  business  is
  less  than  the  number  of aggregate employment shares it maintained in
  such area in the base year.
    (2) The number of  eligible  aggregate  employment  shares  determined
  under   this  paragraph  shall  be  the  number  of  eligible  aggregate
  employment shares determined pursuant  to  subdivision  (i)  of  section
  22-621  of  this  chapter  without regard to paragraphs one and three of
  such  subdivision  (i),  less  the  reduction  amount  provided  for  in
  paragraph three of this subdivision.
    (3)  For any taxable year, the reduction amount shall be the excess of
  (i) the number of aggregate employment shares maintained by the eligible
  business in the eligible Lower Manhattan area in  the  base  year,  over
  (ii)  the  number  of  aggregate  employment  shares  maintained  by the
  eligible business in the eligible Lower Manhattan area  in  the  taxable
  year.
    (4)  Notwithstanding  anything  herein  to the contrary, the number of
  eligible aggregate employment  shares  may  be  determined  pursuant  to
  paragraph  two  of  this  subdivision  only if the number of such shares
  determined pursuant to such paragraph two is less  than  the  number  of
  such  shares determined pursuant to subdivision (i) of section 22-621 of
  this chapter.
    (5) The mayor, or his or her designee,  may  exercise  the  discretion
  provided  for  in  paragraph  one  of  this  subdivision  if  he  or she
  determines it to be in the best  interests  of  the  city,  taking  into
  account  whether  the  credit  provided  for  in this section caused the
  reduction in the number of jobs maintained by the eligible  business  in
  the eligible Lower Manhattan area.
