Section 22-504

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  22-504 Experience; honorably discharged members of the armed forces
  of  the  United  States.  Whenever,  by  the  provisions  of  the  code,
  experience  in  a  particular  trade is a prerequisite for obtaining any
  license, certificate or permit issued thereunder, the period of  service
  in  the  armed  forces of the United States in an area designated by the
  president of the United States by executive order as a "combat zone"  at
  any  time during the period designated by the president as the period of
  combatant activities in such zone, by  an  honorably  discharged  member
  thereof  who  shall apply for such license, certificate or permit, shall
  be deemed the equivalent of such experience on a year for year basis and
  shall be accepted accordingly, provided, however,  that  such  applicant
  prior  to his or her entry into the said armed forces possessed not less
  than one year of the experience required under  the  code,  and  further
  provided  that  such  experience  was interrupted by such entry into the
  said armed forces. An applicant may apply the provisions of this section
  and  section  22-504.1  of  this  chapter  to  satisfy  the   experience
  prerequisite   in   a  particular  trade  for  the  applicable  license,
  certificate or permit.  The provisions of this section shall  not  apply
  to  license  of  hoist  machine operator, master rigger, master plumber,
  site  safety  coordinator,  site   safety   manager   and   license   of
  high-pressure boiler operating engineer, except that of an applicant for
  a  license  of  high-pressure  boiler  operating  engineer, who has had,
  during  the  ten  years  immediately  preceding  the  filing   of   this
  application, at least five years' experience required under the code, or
  at  least  one year's experience prior to his or her entry into the said
  armed  forces,  and  while  in  the  said  armed  forces  served  as   a
  firefighter, oiler, boilermaker, machinist, water tender or engineer, or
  while in the said armed forces performed duties equivalent to the duties
  performed by firefighter, oiler, boilermaker, machinist, water tender or
  engineer  for  an  additional  period  of  time, to make a total of five
  years' experience, shall be deemed to possess the required experience as
  applicant for a license  of  high-pressure  boiler  operating  engineer.
  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision of this section, the head of each
  city agency  issuing  any  license,  certificate  or  permit  for  which
  experience  in  a  particular  trade  is  a  prerequisite shall have the
  authority to determine whether additional experience is necessary before
  issuing any such license, certificate or permit. The provisions of  this
  section  shall  apply only to applicants who are at least eighteen years
  of age; and are able to read and write the English language.
