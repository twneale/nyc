Section 22-504.1

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  22-504.1 Equivalent experience; honorably discharged members of the
  armed forces of the United States. Whenever, by the  provisions  of  the
  code,  experience  in a particular trade is a prerequisite for obtaining
  any license, certificate or permit  issued  thereunder,  the  period  of
  service  in  the  armed  forces  of  the  United  States by an honorably
  discharged member thereof who shall apply for such license,  certificate
  or  permit,  shall be deemed the equivalent of such experience on a year
  for year basis and shall be  accepted  accordingly,  provided,  however,
  that  such  applicant  while  in  said  armed  forces  performed  duties
  equivalent to experience required for any such license,  certificate  or
  permit,  and  provided  further  that  only the period of service during
  which such equivalent duties were performed shall be  deemed  equivalent
  experience.  An  applicant  may apply the provisions of this section and
  section 22-504 of this chapter to satisfy the experience prerequisite in
  a particular trade for the applicable license,  certificate  or  permit.
  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision of this section, the head of each
  city agency  issuing  any  license,  certificate  or  permit  for  which
  experience  in  a  particular  trade  is  a  prerequisite shall have the
  authority to determine whether additional experience is necessary before
  issuing any such license, certificate or permit. The provisions of  this
  section  shall  apply only to applicants who are at least eighteen years
  of age; and are able to read and write the English language.
