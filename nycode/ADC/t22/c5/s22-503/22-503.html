Section 22-503

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  22-503  Extension  or  renewal  of  licenses  and permits issued to
  persons performing active duty in the army, navy  or  marine  corps.  a.
  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  any law, rule or regulation or the
  terms or conditions of  any  license  relating  to  the  examination  of
  applicants  for  such licenses or the payment of fees therefor, the head
  of each agency of the city authorized to issue licenses or permits shall
  extend or renew any license issued by such  agency  to  any  person  who
  shall:
    1.  Engage  in  the  performance  of  active duty in the army, navy or
  marine corps of the United States,
    2. Be honorably discharged therefrom or be relieved from  active  duty
  therein without fault or delinquency, and
    3.  Hold such license at the time of entrance upon such performance of
  active duty.
    b. Upon application of any such  person  to  the  appropriate  agency,
  within  one year from his or her discharge from active duty, and without
  further examination as to the qualification of the applicant,  the  head
  of such agency shall renew such license.
    c. Where the license is one for which there is an annual fee and where
  the  business or occupation has been discontinued while the licensee was
  in active service, the head of such agency shall credit against the  fee
  for  the  renewed  license  a sum equal to one-twelfth of the annual fee
  paid by the applicant for the license held by him or her for each  month
  of  such  active  duty until the expiration of such license. Application
  for such renewal of license shall be made within sixty  days  after  the
  applicant's  discharge  from  active duty. If at the time of renewal the
  credit, computed as above provided, is greater than the fee charged  for
  the  renewed  license,  the remainder of such credit shall be applied to
  the fee charged for the next subsequent renewal of such license.
    d. Nothing in this section shall affect any law, rule or regulation of
  any agency relating to the premises where the business or occupation  is
  to be conducted or to the location or sanitary condition thereof.
    e. The term "license" as used in this section shall include permits.
    f.  Notwithstanding  the provisions of this section and section 19-505
  of the code, the following persons shall be entitled to receive  taxicab
  licenses upon the following terms and conditions:
    1.  Any  person  who  held  a  taxicab  license  and  transferred same
  immediately preceding entry into the performance of active duty  in  the
  army,  navy  or  marine  corps  of the United States, in anticipation of
  engaging in the performance of such active duty,  and  was  subsequently
  honorably discharged therefrom.
    2. Any person who held a taxicab license at the time of entry into the
  performance  of  active  duty  in  the army, navy or marine corps of the
  United States and transferred such taxicab license while engaged in such
  duty and was or is subsequently honorably discharged.
    3. Applications for taxicab licenses under this  subdivision  must  be
  made  to  the  taxicab  and  limosine  commission within one hundred and
  twenty days after his or her discharge from military service.
    4.  Taxicab  licenses  issued  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  this
  subdivision  shall  not  be  transferable except that licenses issued to
  World War  II  veterans  (if  current  and  operative  April  fifteenth,
  nineteen  hundred  sixty-three),  shall  be  transferable  provided said
  licenses have not been  previously  revoked  for  cause  or  surrendered
  voluntarily.
    In the event that the holder of such a license has died prior to March
  twenty-seventh,  nineteen  hundred  sixty-seven,  a transferable license
  shall be issued to the legal representative of  the  deceased  licensee,

  provided  said  representative files a suitable application therefor and
  is qualified to hold such license.
