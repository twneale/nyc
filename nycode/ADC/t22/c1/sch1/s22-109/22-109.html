  free  use  or  navigation by merchandise or material not affixed to such
  wharf property or marginal street, or by an automobile, wagon, truck  or
  cart,  or  by  any floating, stranded or sunken vessel or craft, and the
  owner, consignee or person in charge thereof shall fail  to  remove  the
  same  when  directed by an order issued by the commissioner, pursuant to
  section seven hundred four of the charter, the commissioner  may  employ
  such  labor  and  equipment as may be necessary to carry out such order.
  The commissioner  may  store  such  merchandise,  material,  automobile,

  consignee  or  person  in  charge and each of them for the amount of the
  expenses so incurred and the commissioner may maintain an action against
  them, or any of them, to recover the same.
