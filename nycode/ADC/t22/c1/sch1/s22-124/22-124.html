Section 22-124

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 22-124 Covenants to maintain marginal streets; water front covenants
  generally; release of. a. The owner of any lands in the city of New York
  formerly  under  water  but  now filled in and having streets physically
  laid out thereover or adjacent thereto, heretofore granted by the mayor,
  aldermen and commonalty of the city of New York, or by the city  of  New
  York,  by  a  grant  containing  covenants  or  conditions requiring the
  maintenance of such streets, and otherwise, may file with the  secretary
  of  the  board  of estimate an application in writing for a release from
  such covenants and conditions setting forth a description of such lands,
  the ownership thereof, the number of feet fronting on the street and the
  width of such street together with a statement enumerating all  of  such
  convenants and conditions relating to such lands. Such application shall
  contain  a statement that all covenants and conditions contained in such
  grant have been complied with  except  the  covenant  or  condition  for
  future  maintenance  of such street. Such secretary, upon payment by the
  applicant of a fee of fifty dollars to cover the  expenses  incident  to
  investigating the truth of the statements contained in such application,
  shall  make  due inquiry and, if such statements are in fact true, shall
  present to such board a report and certificate as to the authenticity of
  the facts set forth in such application. Such board may thereafter adopt
  a resolution approving of the report of such secretary. If  such  report
  is  approved by such board, such owner may obtain from the comptroller a
  release of all covenants and conditions contained in such grant  insofar
  as  such  convenants  and  conditions affect the lands of the applicant,
  upon payment to the commissioner of finance of a  sum  equal  to  twenty
  dollars  per front foot of such property based on a street sixty feet in
  width, or of a proportional sum based on streets  having  a  greater  or
  less  width,  and  upon receipt of such sum, such comptroller for and on
  behalf of the city, shall issue to such owner a  certificate  evidencing
  such  release,  the  same  to be in form for recording. Such certificate
  shall be approved as to form by  the  corporation  counsel  and  may  be
  recorded  in  the same manner and in the same recording office as a deed
  of real property. After such release, with respect to any  parcel,  such
  city  shall  keep  in  repair  or cause to be kept in repair the roadway
  portion of such street on which the parcel abuts.
    b. In the event that any such convenants  or  conditions,  other  than
  those  requiring  the maintenance of streets, have not been performed in
  whole or in  part,  a  special  application  for  a  release  from  such
  covenants  or  conditions,  on  a  form to be prescribed by the board of
  estimate, may be made by such owner  to  such  board.  Such  application
  shall  set  forth  a description of such land by metes and bounds, or by
  street and number, the dimensions of such land, a statement  enumerating
  all  the  covenants  and  conditions  relating to such land, or, in lieu
  thereof, a copy  of  the  grant  of  such  land,  or  other  instrument,
  containing  all  such  covenants  and  conditions and a statement of the
  particular covenants or conditions, specifying  them,  for  the  release
  from  which  the application is made, and such other information as such
  board may deem necessary or appropriate. Such board, upon payment  of  a
  fee of fifty dollars, shall cause an investigation to be made concerning
  the  statement  contained  in  such  application. If satisfied from such
  investigation that the interests of the  city  will  not  be  prejudiced
  thereby,  such  board,  by  resolution  may authorize the comptroller to
  issue to such owner a release from such covenants and conditions  for  a
  sum of money to be agreed upon by and between such board and such owner.
  Upon  receipt  of such sum, such comptroller shall, for and on behalf of
  the city, issue to such owner a  certificate  evidencing  such  release.
  Such certificate shall be approved as to form by the corporation counsel
  and  may be recorded in the office of the commissioner of transportation

  and in the same manner and in the same recording office  as  a  deed  of
  real property.
