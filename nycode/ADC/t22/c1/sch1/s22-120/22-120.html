Section 22-120

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  22-120  Commissioner  may  remove  abandoned  wharf  structures. a.
  Whenever any pier, bulkhead, platform or other wharf structure shall  be
  abandoned  and constitute an obstruction to navigation, the commissioner
  shall notify the owner of such property, if known  to  him  or  her,  to
  remove the same forthwith. If the owner is unknown, or is not within the
  city,  or  shall fail to comply with such notice, the commissioner shall
  cause such obstruction to be removed. The expense of such removal  shall
  be  recoverable  by  action  from  the  owner and shall be a lien on the
  property so removed until paid.
    b. If such property is unclaimed within thirty days after removal, the
  commissioner shall advertise the same for sale, at public auction to the
  highest bidder, in the City Record for six days. The  proceeds  of  each
  such sale shall be paid into the general fund.
