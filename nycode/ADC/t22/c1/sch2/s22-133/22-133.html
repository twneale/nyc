Section 22-133

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  22-133  Acquisition  of  the  necessary real property. a. After the
  adoption and certification of such plans, and the filing thereof in  the
  office  of  the  commissioner,  the mayor may direct the commissioner to
  acquire any and all real property included in such plans or any interest
  therein, which may  be  necessary  for  the  creation  of  the  terminal
  facilities  shown  upon  the map or maps forming part of such plans. The
  proceedings for the acquisition of the title to such property  shall  be
  taken  and  conducted  in  the  manner  prescribed  in subchapter one of
  chapter three of title five of the code.
    b. Whenever, at any height, or depth, an area of land is required  for
  the  purposes  of  such  terminal  facilities,  the  entire  fee of land
  furnishing such area, or such lesser estate therein,  as  the  board  of
  estimate  shall  deem  needed for public use may be so acquired; and the
  city may use for other public purposes, or may lease or permit  the  use
  for storage, warehousing, manufacturing or otherwise, of such levels and
  parts  of  levels  thereof  as from time to time may not be required for
  such terminal facilities.
    c. The area  of  land  to  be  so  acquired  may  include  such  area,
  additional  and  adjacent  to  that  required  for the structure of such
  terminal ways or stations, as such board may authorize  and  certify  as
  required  to  be replotted, regraded or otherwise adapted for convenient
  access to and use of such ways or stations or other improvement  of  the
  water front of the city in connection therewith.
    d.  Such parts of the lands acquired by the city under and pursuant to
  the provisions of this subchapter which in the judgment of the board  of
  estimate  are  no longer required for the improvement of the water front
  facilities of the city or for any other public purpose, except the  part
  of  such lands so acquired as have been heretofore assigned by the board
  of estimate to the use of the department of ports and trade, may be sold
  by the city in the manner prescribed by subdivision b of  section  three
  hundred  eighty-four  of the charter. The proceeds of such sale shall be
  paid into the real property fund.
