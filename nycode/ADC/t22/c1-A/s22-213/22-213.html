Section 22-213

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  22-213  Fees  and  terms  of  licenses  and  registrations.  a. The
  commissioner shall by rule establish fees for the issuance  and  renewal
  of  registrations  and  of  licenses pursuant to this chapter in amounts
  sufficient to compensate the city  for  the  administrative  expense  of
  issuing  or  renewing  a  registration  or  license  and  the expense of
  inspections and other  activities  related  thereto.  A  license  issued
  pursuant to this chapter shall be valid for two years. A business entity
  that is licensed pursuant to this chapter shall provide the commissioner
  in  a  form prescribed by the commissioner pursuant to rules promulgated
  under this chapter with notice of at least  ten  business  days  of  the
  proposed  addition  of  a  new  principal  to  such business entity. The
  commissioner may waive or shorten such period upon a showing that  there
  exists  a  bona  fide  business  requirement  therefor. Except where the
  commissioner  determines  within  such  period,  based  on   information
  available  to  him  or  her, that the addition of such new principal may
  have a result inimical to the purposes of this chapter, the licensee may
  add such new principal pending the completion of  review  under  section
  22-216 of this chapter. The licensee shall be afforded an opportunity to
  demonstrate  to the commissioner that the addition of such new principal
  pending completion of review under section 22-216 of this chapter  would
  not  have a result inimical to the purposes of this chapter. If upon the
  completion  of  such  review,  the  commissioner  determines  that  such
  principal lacks good character, honesty and integrity, the license shall
  cease  to be valid unless such principal divests his or her interest, or
  discontinues his or her involvement in the business of such licensee, as
  the case may be, within the time period prescribed by the commissioner.
    b. The commissioner shall be authorized to  extend  the  term  of  the
  license  for  an additional one year period at his or her discretion and
  shall establish an additional fee therefor.
    c. A registration issued pursuant to this chapter shall be  valid  for
  two years.
