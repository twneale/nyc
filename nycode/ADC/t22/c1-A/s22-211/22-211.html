Section 22-211

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  22-211  Registration  required for seafood delivery business. a. It
  shall be unlawful to conduct a seafood delivery business in  the  fulton
  fish  market  distribution  area  without  having  first registered such
  business with the commissioner and obtained a registration  number  from
  the  commissioner.  A  registration  application shall be submitted by a
  seafood delivery business upon a form  prescribed  by  the  commissioner
  containing  such  information  as the commissioner shall require by rule
  and shall be signed by all  the  principals  of  such  seafood  delivery
  business. The market manager may require that seafood deliverers affix a
  sticker  or  decal containing such registration number to their delivery
  vehicles. A seafood delivery registration number  or  sticker  or  decal
  shall not be transferable.
    b. (i) Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, the commissioner
  may,  when  there  is reasonable cause to believe that any or all of the
  principals, employees  or  agents  of  a  seafood  deliverer  lack  good
  character,  honesty  and  integrity,  require  that  any  or all of such
  principals  be  fingerprinted  and  provide  to  the  commissioner   the
  information  set  forth  in  subdivision  a  of  section  22-216 of this
  chapter, and may, after notice and the opportunity to be  heard,  refuse
  to  register  such  seafood  deliverer  for  the  reasons  set  forth in
  subdivision b of such section.
    (ii) If at any time  subsequent  to  the  registration  of  a  seafood
  deliverer,  the commissioner has reasonable cause to believe that any or
  all of the principals, employees or agents of a seafood deliverer  lacks
  good character, honesty and integrity, the commissioner may require that
  any  or  all  of  such  principals  be  fingerprinted  and  provide  the
  background information required by subdivision a of  section  22-216  of
  this  chapter  and  may, after notice and the opportunity for a hearing,
  revoke the registration of such seafood deliverer for  the  reasons  set
  forth in subdivision b of such section.
