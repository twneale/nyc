Section 22-254

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  22-254  Conduct  of wholesale businesses and market businesses. The
  commissioner shall establish by rule measures governing the  conduct  of
  wholesale  businesses  and  market  businesses  in  the public wholesale
  markets, including but not limited to: (i) requirements  that  wholesale
  businesses  maintain and supply their registration numbers to suppliers,
  and shippers and truckers; (ii) requirements for the disposal  of  waste
  and  other  sanitary  measures;  (iii) appropriate insurance and bonding
  requirements; (iv) provisions requiring  the  maintenance  of  financial
  statements,  records,  ledgers,  receipts,  bills and such other written
  records as the commissioner  determines  are  necessary  or  useful  for
  carrying  out  the  purposes  of  this  chapter.  Such  records shall be
  maintained for a  period  of  time  not  to  exceed  five  years  to  be
  determined  by  rule  by  the commissioner, provided, however, that such
  rule may provide that the commissioner may, in specific instances at his
  or her discretion, require that records be maintained for  a  period  of
  time exceeding such five years. Such records shall be made available for
  inspection  and  audit  at the request of the commissioner at either the
  registrant's place of business or at the offices of the department;  and
  (v)  such  other  rules  as  he or she deems necessary or appropriate to
  effectuate the provisions of this chapter.
