<pre>
    
 
    &sect;   22-260   Revocation   or   suspension  of  registration  or  photo
  identification card. In addition to the penalties  provided  in  section
  22-258  of  this  code,  the  commissioner  may revoke a temporary photo
  identification card, and after notice and hearing revoke  or  suspend  a
  registration  issued  pursuant  to  section  22-253 of this chapter or a
  photo identification card when the registrant or its officers, employees
  or agents or a person to whom such photo identification  card  has  been
  issued:  (i)  has  been  found to be in violation of this chapter or any
  rules promulgated pursuant thereto; (ii) has repeatedly failed  to  obey
  lawful orders of representatives of the department; (iii) in the case of
  a person who works in the market and holds an office in a labor union or
  labor  organization,  or in a wholesale trade association, has failed to
  obey a commissioner's order of disqualification from holding such office
  pursuant to subdivision c of section 22-264 or subdivision c of  section
  22-265  of  this  chapter; (iv) has continued to employ a person who has
  failed to obey a commissioner's order of disqualification  from  holding
  office  in  a  labor organization or labor union or a trade association;
  (v) has failed to pay any fines or civil penalties imposed  pursuant  to
  this  chapter  or  the  rules promulgated pursuant hereto; (vi) has been
  found in persistent or substantial  violation  of  any  city,  state  or
  federal  laws,  rules  or regulations regarding the improper handling of
  food, or any laws prohibiting deceptive, unfair, or unconscionable trade
  practices; (vii) has been found by the commissioner, after consideration
  of the factors set forth in subdivision b  of  section  22-259  of  this
  chapter  to  lack good character, honesty and integrity; (viii) has been
  found to have made any false statement or any misrepresentation as to  a
  material  fact  in the application or accompanying papers upon which the
  issuance or renewal of the registration or photo identification card was
  based; or (ix) has failed to notify  the  commissioner  as  required  by
  subdivision  b  of  section 22-252 or subdivision a of section 22-253 of
  this code of any change in the ownership interest  of  the  business  or
  other material change in the information required on the application for
  such  registration  or  photo  identification  card, or of the arrest or
  criminal conviction of the registrant or any of  his  or  her  officers,
  employees or agents of which the registrant had knowledge or should have
  known.  Nothing  in  this  section  shall  be  construed  to  permit the
  revocation of a photo identification card of an employee who is a member
  of a labor union or labor organization solely for the reason  that  such
  person  has  sought  to  engage  in  the lawful exercise within a public
  wholesale market of an activity protected under the  provisions  of  the
  National  Labor  Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. &sect; 141 et seq. The commissioner
  shall consult with the commissioner of labor relations prior to reaching
  any determination that an activity by a representative of a labor  union
  or  labor  organization is not lawful under the National Labor Relations
  Act.
