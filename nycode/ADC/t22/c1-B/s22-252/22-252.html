Section 22-252

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  22-252  Photo identification card required. a. It shall be unlawful
  for any person to be an employee or a principal working in  a  wholesale
  business  or market business in a market unless such person has obtained
  a photo identification card issued by the commissioner pursuant  to  the
  provisions  of  this  chapter  or  for a person to work on an occasional
  basis in a market unless such person has obtained a day pass  issued  by
  the commissioner. The commissioner shall set forth by rule the number of
  occasions   within   a  specified  time  period  that  shall  constitute
  occasional work to meet unanticipated needs of businesses in the  market
  and  shall  make  reasonable  provision  to  delegate  authority for the
  issuance of day passes on a twenty-four hour basis to persons  hired  to
  work  by  wholesalers  and  market  businesses on an occasional basis. A
  photo identification card shall be in the possession of an  employee  or
  principal  at  all  times when such person is in the market and shall be
  produced  upon  demand  by  an  authorized  employee  or  agent  of  the
  department,  the  department  of investigation or the police department.
  The commissioner shall make provision for temporary photo identification
  cards to be issued pending the processing of applications for  permanent
  photo  identification  cards  and  for  the  expedited issuance of photo
  identification cards to family members of principals of a wholesaler  or
  market  business  and  others  who work on a seasonal basis. A temporary
  identification card shall cease to be valid, and shall  be  returned  to
  the  department,  upon  the refusal to issue a photo identification card
  pursuant to subdivision d of this section or denial of  registration  to
  the  business  in which the person applying for such identification card
  is a principal or is employed.
    b. A photo identification card shall identify the  business  of  which
  the  individual  is  a  principal  or by which he or she is employed and
  shall be non-transferrable. Upon a change in employment within a market,
  an individual shall inform the department and the department shall issue
  a photo identification card reflecting such changed employment.
    c. An application for a photo identification card shall  be  submitted
  on  a  form  prescribed  by  the  commissioner  and  shall  contain such
  information  as  the  commissioner  shall  determine  is  necessary   to
  establish  the  identity  and  background  of  the  applicant.  A person
  required by this chapter to possess a photo  identification  card  shall
  inform  the  commissioner  of  any  subsequent  material  change  in the
  information provided on such application, including but not  limited  to
  arrests and/or criminal convictions.
    d.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of this section, where the
  commissioner has reasonable cause to believe that  an  applicant  for  a
  photo  identification  card lacks good character, honesty and integrity,
  the commissioner may require that such applicant  be  fingerprinted  and
  provide  to  the commissioner the information set forth in subdivision a
  of section 22-259 of this  chapter.  The  commissioner  may  thereafter,
  after  notice  and  opportunity  to  be  heard,  refuse to issue a photo
  identification card for the reasons set forth in subdivision b  of  such
  section.
    e. If at any time subsequent to the issuance of a photo identification
  card,  the  commissioner has reasonable cause to believe that the holder
  thereof does not possess good  character,  honesty  and  integrity,  the
  commissioner  may require such person to be fingerprinted and to provide
  the background information required by subdivision a of  section  22-259
  of  this  chapter  and  may,  after  notice and opportunity to be heard,
  revoke such photo identification card  for  the  reasons  set  forth  in
  subdivision b of such section.
