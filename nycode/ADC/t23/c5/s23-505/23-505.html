Section 23-505

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  23-505  Internet data set policy and technical standards. a. Within
  one hundred eighty days of the  effective  date  of  this  chapter,  the
  department  shall  prepare  and publish a technical standards manual for
  the publishing of public data sets in raw or unprocessed form through  a
  single web portal by city agencies for the purpose of making public data
  available to the greatest number of users and for the greatest number of
  applications and shall, whenever practicable, use open standards for web
  publishing  and e-government. Such manual shall identify the reasons why
  each technical standard was selected and for which types of data  it  is
  applicable  and  may recommend or require that data be published in more
  than one technical standard. The manual shall include a plan to adopt or
  utilize a web application programming interface that permits application
  programs to request and receive public data sets directly from  the  web
  portal. Such manual shall be updated by the department as necessary.
    b.  The  department  shall  consult with voluntary consensus standards
  bodies and shall, when such participation is  feasible,  in  the  public
  interest  and  is  compatible  with  agency  and  departmental missions,
  authorities  and  priorities,  participate  with  such  bodies  in   the
  development of technical and open standards.
