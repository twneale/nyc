Section 8-301

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  8-301  Legislative  declaration. It is hereby found that the letter
  and spirit of the constitution of the United States are  being  violated
  in  some  jurisdictions  under color of law with the result that persons
  from this city and state, as  well  as  from  other  states,  are  being
  subjected   to   discriminatory  treatment  in  the  exercise  of  their
  constitutional rights because of race or because they seek  the  removal
  of  unconstitutional  barriers  to equal rights. Such persons, sometimes
  referred  to  as  freedom  riders  and  sit-ins,  intent  upon  peaceful
  resistance  to  discrimination,  segregation  and the achievement of the
  constitutional rights of all persons in all jurisdictions of the  United
  States,  have  suffered the stigma of criminal proceedings. It is hereby
  declared to be the policy of the city to  remove  or  to  neutralize  by
  affording  to  such  residents  appropriate relief to the fullest extent
  possible, the effect upon  residents  of  this  city  of  such  criminal
  proceedings,  resulting  from the attempted use of public transportation
  facilities and other places of public accommodation.
