Section 8-701

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 8-701 Legislative declaration. Boycotts or blacklists that are based
  on  a  person's  race,  color,  creed, age, national origin, alienage or
  citizenship status, marital status, partnership status,  gender,  sexual
  orientation,  or  disability  pose a menace to the city's foundation and
  institutions. In contrast  to  protests  that  are  in  reaction  to  an
  unlawful  discriminatory  practice,  connected  with  a labor dispute or
  associated with other speech or activities that  are  protected  by  the
  first   amendment   discriminatory  boycotts  cause  havoc,  divide  the
  citizenry and do not serve a legitimate purpose.  The  council  declares
  that  discriminatory  boycotts  are  a  dangerously  insidious  form  of
  prejudice  and  hereby  establishes  a   procedure   for   expeditiously
  investigating  allegations  of this type of prejudice, assuring that the
  council and mayor are duly alerted to the existence of such activity and
  combating discriminatory boycotts or blacklists.
