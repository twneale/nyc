Section 8-404

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  8-404  Civil  penalty.  In  any  civil action commenced pursuant to
  section 8-402 of this chapter, the trier of fact may, to  vindicate  the
  public  interest, impose upon any person who is found to have engaged in
  a pattern or practice that results in the denial to any  person  of  the
  full enjoyment of any right secured by chapter one of this title a civil
  penalty of not more than two hundred fifty thousand dollars. In relation
  to  determining  the appropriate amount of civil penalties to be imposed
  pursuant to this section a liable party may plead and prove any relevant
  mitigating factor. Any civil penalties so  recovered  pursuant  to  this
  chapter shall be paid into the general fund of the city. Nothing in this
  section shall be construed to preclude the city from recovering damages,
  including  punitive  damages, and other relief pursuant to section 8-402
  of this chapter in addition to civil penalties.
