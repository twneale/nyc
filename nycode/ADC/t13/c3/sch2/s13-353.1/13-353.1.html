Section 13-353.1

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  13-353.1  Accidental  disability  retirement;  World  Trade  Center
  presumption. 1. (a) Notwithstanding any provisions of this  code  or  of
  any  general, special or local law, charter or rule or regulation to the
  contrary, if any condition or  impairment  of  health  is  caused  by  a
  qualifying World Trade Center condition as defined in section two of the
  retirement  and  social  security  law, it shall be presumptive evidence
  that it was incurred in the performance and discharge of  duty  and  the
  natural  and proximate result of an accident not caused by such member's
  own willful negligence, unless  the  contrary  be  proved  by  competent
  evidence.
    (b)  The New York City Fire Department Pension Fund (NYCFDPF) board of
  trustees is hereby authorized to promulgate  rules  and  regulations  to
  implement the provisions of this paragraph.
    2.  (a)  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  this  chapter or of any
  general, special or local law, charter, administrative code or  rule  or
  regulation  to the contrary, if a member who participated in World Trade
  Center rescue, recovery or cleanup operations as defined in section  two
  of the retirement and social security law, and subsequently retired on a
  service  retirement,  an  ordinary  disability retirement, an accidental
  disability retirement, a performance of duty disability  retirement,  or
  was separated from service with a vested right to deferred payability of
  a  retirement  allowance and subsequent to such retirement or separation
  is determined by the head of the retirement system to have a  qualifying
  World  Trade  Center  condition,  as  defined  in  section  two  of  the
  retirement and social security  law,  upon  such  determination  by  the
  NYCFDPF board of trustees, it shall be presumed that such disability was
  incurred  in  the  performance  and discharge of duty as the natural and
  proximate result of an accident not caused by such member's own  willful
  negligence,  and  that the member would have been physically or mentally
  incapacitated for the performance and discharge of duty of the  position
  from  which he or she retired or vested had the condition been known and
  fully developed at the time of the  member's  retirement  or  separation
  from  service  with  vested  rights,  unless  the  contrary is proven by
  competent evidence.
    (b) The NYCFDPF shall consider  a  reclassification  of  the  member's
  retirement  or  vesting as an accidental disability retirement effective
  as of the date of such reclassification.
    (c) Such member's retirement option shall not be changed as  a  result
  of such reclassification.
    (d)  The  member's  former  employer  at  the  time  of  the  member's
  retirement shall have  an  opportunity  to  be  heard  on  the  member's
  application  for  reclassification  by  the  NYCFDPF  board  of trustees
  according to procedures developed by the NYCFDPF.
    (e) The NYCFDPF board of trustees is hereby authorized  to  promulgate
  rules and regulations to implement the provisions of this paragraph.
    3.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this chapter or of any
  general, special or local law, charter, administrative code or  rule  or
  regulation  to the contrary, if a retiree or vestee who: (1) has met the
  criteria of subdivision one of this section and retired on a service  or
  disability  retirement,  would  have  met  the  criteria  if not already
  retired on an accidental disability, or was separated from service  with
  a vested right to deferred payability of a retirement allowance; and (2)
  has  not been retired for more than twenty-five years; and (3) dies from
  a qualifying World Trade Center condition, as defined in section two  of
  the  retirement and social security law, as determined by the applicable
  head of the retirement system or applicable medical board,  then  unless
  the  contrary  be  proven  by competent evidence, such retiree or vestee
  shall be deemed to have died as a natural and  proximate  result  of  an

  accident  sustained  in  the  performance of duty and not as a result of
  willful negligence on his  or  her  part.  Such  retiree's  or  vestee's
  eligible beneficiary, as set forth in section 13-347 of this subchapter,
  shall be entitled to an accidental death benefit as provided by sections
  13-347  and  13-348  of  this  subchapter,  however, for the purposes of
  determining the salary base upon which the accidental death  benefit  is
  calculated,  the  retiree  or vestee shall be deemed to have died on the
  date of his or her retirement or separation  from  service  with  vested
  rights.  Upon  the retiree's or vestee's death, the eligible beneficiary
  shall make a written application to the head of  the  retirement  system
  within  the  time  for  filing  an  application  for an accidental death
  benefit as set forth in sections 13-347 and 13-348  of  this  subchapter
  requesting  conversion  of  such  retiree's  service,  vested  right  or
  disability retirement benefit to an accidental  death  benefit.  At  the
  time  of  such conversion, the eligible beneficiary shall relinquish all
  rights  to  the  prospective  benefits  payable  under  the  service  or
  disability retirement benefit or vested right to such benefit, including
  any  post-retirement  death  benefits,  since  the retiree's or vestee's
  death. If the eligible beneficiary is not the only beneficiary receiving
  or entitled to  receive  a  benefit  under  the  service  or  disability
  retirement benefit (including, but not limited to, post-retirement death
  benefits  or  benefits  paid or payable pursuant to the retiree's option
  selection), or  that  will  be  eligible  under  the  vested  right  the
  accidental  death  benefit  payments to the eligible beneficiary will be
  reduced by any amounts paid or payable to any other beneficiary.
    4. Notwithstanding any other provision of this code or of any general,
  special or local law, charter, or rule or regulation to the contrary, if
  a member who: (1) has met  the  criteria  of  subdivision  one  of  this
  section;  (2)  dies  in  active service or after separating from service
  with a vested right to deferred payability of  a  retirement  allowance,
  but  prior  to the payability of that retirement allowance; and (3) dies
  from a qualifying World Trade Center condition, as  defined  in  section
  two  of  the  retirement  and  social security law, as determined by the
  applicable head of the retirement system or  applicable  medical  board,
  then  unless  the  contrary be proven by competent evidence, such member
  shall be deemed to have died as a natural and  proximate  result  of  an
  accident  sustained  in  the  performance of duty and not as a result of
  willful  negligence  on  his  or  her  part.  Such   member's   eligible
  beneficiary, as set forth in section 13-347 of this subchapter, shall be
  entitled to an accidental death benefit provided he or she makes written
  application  to  the  head  of the retirement system within the time for
  filing an application for an accidental death benefit as  set  forth  in
  section 13-347 of this subchapter.
