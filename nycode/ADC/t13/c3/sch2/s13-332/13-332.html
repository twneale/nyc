    &sect;  13-332  Contributions  of  the  city and their use; pension reserve
  fund.  The pension reserve fund shall be the fund from  which  shall  be
  paid             all             pensions,            and            all
  pensions-providing-for-increased-take-home-pay, and all benefits in lieu
  of     pensions,     and     all      benefits      in      lieu      of
  pensions-providing-for-increased-take-home-pay, if any, allowable by the
  city  on  account  of the city-service of improved benefit plan members.
  Should  any  pension  or   pension-providing-for-increased-take-home-pay
  payable from such pension reserve fund be cancelled, the pension reserve
  or   reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay   thereon  shall  thereupon  be
  transferred from the pension reserve  fund  to  the  contingent  reserve
  fund.  Should  any pension-providing-for-increased-take-home-pay payable
  from such fund be reduced, the amount of the annual  reduction  in  such
  pension  or  pension-providing-for-increased-take-home-pay shall be paid
  annually into the contingent reserve fund  during  the  period  of  such
  reduction.
