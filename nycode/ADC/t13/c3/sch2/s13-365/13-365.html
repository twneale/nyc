Section 13-365

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  13-365  Accidental  disability  benefits in the case of retirements
  prior to July 1, 1965. a.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  section
  13-364  of this subchapter, in any case where a retirement allowance was
  awarded  under  the  provisions  of  such  section,  by  reason  of  the
  retirement  for  accidental disability of a member occurring before July
  first, nineteen hundred sixty-five, such retirement allowance  shall  be
  not  less  than three-fourths the annual salary or compensation earnable
  by a first  grade  firefighter  on  July  first,  nineteen  hundred  and
  sixty-five.  In  the  case  of  a  member  receiving a lesser retirement
  allowance, such retirement allowance shall be  increased  to  an  amount
  which will equal three-fourths of the earnable salary or compensation of
  a   first   grade  firefighter  on  July  first,  nineteen  hundred  and
  sixty-five. Such retirement allowance shall be computed as it would have
  been without deduction for outstanding loans and optional modifications.
    b. Such retirement allowance shall be payable to the same persons  and
  shall  be subject to the same terms and conditions, including provisions
  as to terminations, as the retirement allowance which would otherwise be
  payable to the members under section 13-364 of this  subchapter  or  any
  other law.
    c. The retirement allowance payable pursuant to the provisions of such
  subdivisions  a and b of this section shall be in lieu of any retirement
  allowance which would otherwise be payable on and  after  the  effective
  date  of  this  section  pursuant to the provisions of section 13-364 of
  this subchapter.
    d. Nothing in this section shall be construed as creating  any  rights
  on  behalf  of  any  person  who  dies  prior to October twenty-seventh,
  nineteen  hundred  sixty-six  and  benefits  due  thereunder  shall   be
  calculated and paid only from such date this law becomes effective.
