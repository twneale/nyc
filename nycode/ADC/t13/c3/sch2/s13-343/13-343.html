Section 13-343

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  13-343  Termination  of  membership;  discontinuance of service. a.
  Should an original plan member discontinue city-service except by  death
  or  retirement,  he  or she shall be paid such part of the amount of the
  accumulated contributions (as defined in subdivision  seven  of  section
  13-313  of  this  subchapter), that is, his or her contributions without
  interest, standing to the credit of his or her individual account in the
  contingent reserve fund as he or she shall demand. Such board,  however,
  in  its  discretion,  may withhold for not more than one year after such
  member last rendered city-service all or part of his or her  accumulated
  contributions,  if  after a previous discontinuance of service he or she
  withdrew  from  the  retirement  allowance  accumulation  fund  or   the
  contingent  reserve  fund, as the case may be, all or part of the amount
  of his or her accumulated contributions and  failed  to  redeposit  such
  withdrawn amount in such fund.
    b.  Should  an  improved benefits plan member discontinue city-service
  except by death or retirement, he or she shall be paid such part of  the
  amount  of the accumulated deductions (as defined in subdivision seven-a
  of such section 13-313 of this subchapter) standing to the credit of his
  or her individual account in the annuity savings fund as he or she shall
  demand. Such board, however, in its discretion,  may  withhold  for  not
  more than one year after such a member last rendered city-service all or
  part  of  his  or  her  accumulated  deductions,  if  after  a  previous
  discontinuance of service he or she withdrew from  the  annuity  savings
  fund  all or part of the amount of his or her accumulated deductions and
  failed to redeposit such withdrawn amount in such fund.
