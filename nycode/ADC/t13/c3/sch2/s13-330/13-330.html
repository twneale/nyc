Section 13-330

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  13-330 Retirement allowance reserve fund for original plan members.
  The retirement allowance reserve fund shall be the fund from which shall
  be  paid  all  retirement  allowances,  and  all  benefits  in  lieu  of
  retirement  allowances,  allowable  by  the  pension fund to persons who
  retired as original plan members or to beneficiaries of such members  on
  account  of  the  city-service of original plan members. Such retirement
  allowances and benefits shall be paid from the contingent  reserve  fund
  in  the event that the retirement allowance reserve fund shall be unable
  to make such payment. Should any retirement allowance payable from  such
  retirement allowance reserve fund be cancelled, the retirement allowance
  reserve  thereon  shall  thereupon  be  transferred  from the retirement
  allowance reserve fund  to  the  contingent  reserve  fund.  Should  any
  retirement  allowance payable from the retirement allowance reserve fund
  be reduced, the amount of the annual reduction in such  allowance  shall
  be  paid  annually into the contingent reserve fund during the period of
  such reduction.
