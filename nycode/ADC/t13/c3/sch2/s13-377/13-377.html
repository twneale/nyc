<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  13-377  Protection  against  fraud or mistake. Any person who shall
  knowingly make any false statement, or shall falsify  or  permit  to  be
  falsified any record or records of this pension fund, shall be guilty of
  a  misdemeanor.  Should  any  change  or  error in records result in any
  member or beneficiary receiving from the pension fund more or less  than
  he  or  she  would  have  been  entitled  to  receive  otherwise, on the
  discovery of any such error such board shall correct such error, and, as
  far as practicable, shall adjust the payments in such a manner that  the
  actuarial  equivalent  of  the  benefit  to which he or she was entitled
  shall be paid.
