  a  period  of  ten years or upwards shall be relieved and dismissed from
  such force upon  his  or  her  own  application,  or  by  order  of  the
  commissioner,  upon  an  examination  by  the  medical examiners of such
  department, to be made at any time  when  so  applied  for  or  when  so
  ordered,  if  a  majority  of  such  medical examiners certify that such
  member is permanently disabled, physically or  mentally,  so  as  to  be
  unfit  for  duty.  Such member so relieved and dismissed from such force
  shall be paid from such fund in monthly installments during his  or  her
  lifetime  a  sum  not  less  than  one-half  of  the  annual  salary  or
  compensation of such member when so retired. A member who has  performed
  duty on such force for a period of twenty-five years or upwards, whether
  continuous or rendered during different periods, upon the application of
  such member in writing, setting forth at what time, not less than thirty
  days  subsequent  to the execution and filing thereof, he or she desires
  to be retired, shall be  relieved  and  dimissed  from  such  force  and
  service  and shall be paid from such fund in monthly installments during
  his or her lifetime a sum not less than one-half of the annual salary or
  compensation of such member when so retired, provided that at  the  time
  so  specified  for  his  or her retirement, his or her term or tenure of
  office or employment shall not have terminated or  been  forfeited,  and
  provided  further  that  upon  his  or her request in writing the member
  shall be granted a leave  of  absence  from  the  date  of  filing  said
  application  until  the date the retirement becomes effective. No member
  shall be retired or  granted  a  pension  while  there  are  charges  of
  official  misconduct pending against him or her.  Pensions granted under
  this section shall be for the life of the pensioner, and  shall  not  be
  revoked, repealed or diminished.
