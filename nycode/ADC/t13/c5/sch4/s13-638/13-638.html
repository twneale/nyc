<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  13-638 Pension to members of the fire force disabled in military or
  naval service of the United States. The board of trustees  of  the  fire
  department  pension  fund shall have the power to retire from membership
  in the fire department and thereupon to grant an annual pension  to  any
  member  of  such  department,  who,  while  in military, naval or marine
  service of the United States has become permanently disabled, physically
  or mentally, so as to be unfit to perform the full duty of  his  or  her
  employment in such department. Such pension shall not exceed one-half of
  the  annual compensation earned by such member at the time of his or her
  retirement and shall be paid in like manner as pensions are paid out  of
  the  fire  department  pension fund of such city. Such board of trustees
  may increase the pension of any member of such department who  has  been
  retired,  prior to the sixth day of May, nineteen hundred twenty-one, by
  reason of  disability,  physical  or  mental,  sustained  while  in  the
  military,  naval or marine service of the United States. Such pension as
  increased shall not exceed one-half of the annual salary earned by  such
  member at the time of his or her retirement.
