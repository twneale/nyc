<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  13-626  Order  of  discontinuance  of pension in certain cases. The
  board of trustees, in its discretion, may order any pension  granted  or
  any  part thereof to cease, except as provided in section 13-624 of this
  chapter, but in all such cases such board shall make a written statement
  of the causes determining such action. Such statement shall  be  entered
  in  the  minutes of the board of trustees. Nothing in this subchapter or
  in any other act, shall render the granting or payment of  such  pension
  obligatory  upon  the  trustees, or chargeable as a matter of right upon
  such fund, except as provided in section 13-624 of this chapter.
