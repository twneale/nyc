  paid             all             pensions,            and            all
  pensions-provided-for-increased-take-home-pay, and all benefits in  lieu
  of      pensions,      and      all      benefits     in     lieu     of

  transferred from the pension reserve  fund  to  the  contingent  reserve
  fund.             Should            any            pension            or
  pension-providing-for-increased-take-home-pay payable from such fund  be
  reduced,  the  amount  of  the  annual  reduction  in  such  pension  or
  pension-providing-for-increased-take-home-pay  shall  be  paid  annually
  into the contingent reserve fund during the period of such reduction.
