<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  13-240 Termination of membership; discontinuance of service. Should
  a member discontinue city-service except by death or retirement,  he  or
  she  shall be paid such part of the amount of the accumulated deductions
  standing to the credit of his or her individual account in  the  annuity
  savings  fund  as  he  or  she shall demand. Such board, however, in its
  discretion, may withhold for not more than one year after a member  last
  rendered  city-service all or part of his or her accumulated deductions,
  if after a previous discontinuance of service he or  she  withdrew  from
  the  annuity  savings  fund  all  or  part  of  the amount of his or her
  accumulated deductions and failed to redeposit such withdrawn amount  in
  such fund.
