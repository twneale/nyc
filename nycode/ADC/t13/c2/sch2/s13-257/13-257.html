<pre>
    
 
    &sect;   13-257   Retirement  allowances;  for  ordinary  disability.  Upon
  retirement for ordinary disability, a member shall receive a  retirement
  allowance which shall consist of:
    1.  An  annuity  which shall be the actuarial equivalent of his or her
  accumulated deductions at the time of his or her retirement; and
    2.  A   pension   which   is   the   actuarial   equivalent   of   the
  reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay  to  which  he  or  she  may then be
  entitled, if any; and
    3. A pension,  which,  together  with  his  or  her  annuity  and  the
  pension-providing-for-increased-take-home-pay,  if  any,  shall be equal
  to:
    a. In the case of a member who contributes on the basis of  retirement
  after  twenty  years  of  city-service,  a retirement allowance equal to
  one-fortieth of his or her annual earnable compensation on the  date  of
  retirement multiplied by the number of years of city-service credited to
  him or her, but not less than (i) one-half of his or her annual earnable
  compensation  on  the  date  of retirement, if the years of city-service
  credited to him or her are ten or more, or (ii) one-third of his or  her
  annual  earnable compensation on the date of retirement, if the years of
  city-service credited to him or her are less than ten; or
    b. In the case of a member who contributes on the basis of  retirement
  after twenty-five years of city-service, a retirement allowance equal to
  one-fiftieth  of  his or her annual earnable compensation on the date of
  retirement, multiplied by the number of years of  city-service  credited
  to  him  or  her,  but  not  less than (i) one-half of his or her annual
  earnable compensation on  the  date  of  retirement,  if  the  years  of
  city-service  credited  to him or her are ten or more, or (ii) one-third
  of his or her annual earnable compensation on the date of retirement, if
  the years of city-service credited to him or her are less than ten; or
    c. (1) In the case of  a  member  who  contributes  on  the  basis  of
  retirement  at  age  fifty-five  the  retirement allowance that would be
  payable to him or her after a like amount of  total-service  and  annual
  earnable  compensation on the date of retirement, had he or she attained
  his or her  minimum  age  for  service  retirement  if  such  retirement
  allowance exceeds one-quarter of his or her annual earnable compensation
  on the date of retirement; otherwise,
    (2)  The  retirement allowance not exceeding one-quarter of his or her
  annual earnable compensation on date of retirement, that would  be  paid
  to  him  or  her  were  his  or  her service and present annual earnable
  compensation on the date of retirement to continue until  attainment  by
  him or her of his or her minimum age of service retirement.
