Section 13-249

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  13-249  Method  of computing certain pensions. In lieu of any other
  retirement benefits granted to him  or  her  upon  retirement  from  the
  police   force,   any   member   who   shall  have  served  as  a  chief
  inspector/chief of operations of the police department on or after  July
  first,  nineteen hundred sixty-six, shall be entitled upon retirement to
  a retirement allowance which shall consist of an annuity  which  is  the
  actuarial equivalent of his or her accumulated deductions at the time of
  his  or  her  retirement from the police force and a pension which, when
  added to such annuity, will make  such  retirement  allowance  equal  to
  two-thirds  of  his or her salary as chief inspector. For the purpose of
  computing  the  annuity  portion  of  such  retirement  allowance,  such
  member's  accumulated  deductions  shall  be the required amount of such
  deductions at the time of  such  member's  retirement  from  the  police
  force,  without  any  increase  resulting  from excess contributions and
  without  any  decrease  resulting  from  withdrawals,  loans,   optional
  modification,  payment  of  his  or  her  contributions  for old age and
  survivor's insurance coverage, or from any other transaction  authorized
  by law.
