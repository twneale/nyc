Section 25-306

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  25-306  Determination  of  request  for certificate of no effect on
  protected architectural features. a. (1) In any case where an  applicant
  for a permit from the department of buildings to construct, reconstruct,
  alter  or  demolish any improvement on a landmark site or in an historic
  district or containing an interior  landmark,  or  an  applicant  for  a
  special  permit  from  the  city  planning  commission  or  the board of
  standards and appeals authorizing any  such  work  pursuant  to  article
  seven  of  the zoning resolution, or amendments thereof, files a copy of
  such application or amended application with  the  commission,  together
  with a request for a certificate of no effect on protected architectural
  features,  the commission shall determine: (a) whether the proposed work
  would change, destroy or affect any exterior  architectural  feature  of
  the  improvement  on  a  landmark site or in an historic district or any
  interior architectural feature of the interior landmark upon which  said
  work  is  to  be  done;  and  (b)  in  the case of construction of a new
  improvement, whether such construction would affect or not be in harmony
  with the external appearance of other, neighboring improvements on  such
  site  or in such district. If the commission determines such question in
  the negative, it shall grant such certificate; otherwise, it shall  deny
  such request.
    (2)  Within  thirty  days  after  the  filing  of such application and
  request, the commission shall either grant  such  certificate,  or  give
  notice  to  the  applicant  of  a  proposed denial of such request. Upon
  written demand of the applicant filed  with  the  commission  after  the
  giving  of notice of a proposed denial, the commission shall confer with
  the  applicant.  The  commission  shall  determine  the  request  for  a
  certificate  within  thirty  days  after the filing of such demand. If a
  demand is not filed within ten days after the giving of  notice  of  the
  proposed denial, the commission shall determine such request within five
  days after the expiration of such ten-day period.
    (3)  In the event of a denial of such a certificate, the applicant may
  file with the commission a request for a certificate of  appropriateness
  with respect to the proposed work specified in such application.
