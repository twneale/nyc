Section 25-301

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  25-301  Purpose  and  declaration  of public policy. a. The council
  finds that many improvements, as herein defined, and landscape features,
  as herein defined, having a special character or a special historical or
  aesthetic interest or  value  and  many  improvements  representing  the
  finest  architectural products of distinct periods in the history of the
  city, have been uprooted, notwithstanding the feasibility of  preserving
  and  continuing the use of such improvements and landscape features, and
  without adequate consideration of the irreplaceable loss to  the  people
  of  the  city of the aesthetic, cultural and historic values represented
  by such improvements and landscape features. In addition, distinct areas
  may be similarly uprooted or may have their  distinctiveness  destroyed,
  although the preservation thereof may be both feasible and desirable. It
  is  the  sense  of the council that the standing of this city as a world
  wide  tourist  center  and  world  capital  of  business,  culture   and
  government   cannot  be  maintained  or  enhanced  by  disregarding  the
  historical and architectural heritage of the city and  by  countenancing
  the destruction of such cultural assets.
    b.  It  is  hereby  declared  as  a  matter  of public policy that the
  protection,  enhancement,  perpetuation  and  use  of  improvements  and
  landscape  features  of  special  character  or  special  historical  or
  aesthetic interest or value is a public necessity and is required in the
  interest of the health, prosperity, safety and welfare  of  the  people.
  The  purpose  of  this  chapter  is  to  (a)  effect  and accomplish the
  protection,  enhancement  and  perpetuation  of  such  improvements  and
  landscape  features and of districts which represent or reflect elements
  of the city's cultural, social, economic,  political  and  architectural
  history;  (b)  safeguard  the  city's  historic,  aesthetic and cultural
  heritage, as embodied and  reflected  in  such  improvements,  landscape
  features  and  districts;  (c)  stabilize and improve property values in
  such  districts;  (d)  foster  civic  pride  in  the  beauty  and  noble
  accomplishments  of  the  past;  (e)  protect  and  enhance  the  city's
  attractions to tourists and visitors and the  support  and  stimulus  to
  business  and  industry  thereby provided; (f) strengthen the economy of
  the city; and (g) promote the  use  of  historic  districts,  landmarks,
  interior  landmarks and scenic landmarks for the education, pleasure and
  welfare of the people of the city.
