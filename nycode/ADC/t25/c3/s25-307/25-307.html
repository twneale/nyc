    &sect; 25-307 Factors governing issuance of certificate of appropriateness.
  a.   In  any  case  where  an  applicant  for  a  permit  to  construct,
  reconstruct, alter or demolish any improvement on a landmark site, or in
  an historic district or containing  an  interior  landmark,  files  such
  application   with   the  commission  together  with  a  request  for  a
  certificate of appropriateness, and in any case where a  certificate  of
  no  effect  on  protected  architectural  features  is  denied  and  the
  applicant thereafter, pursuant to the provisions of  section  25-306  of
  this  chapter, files a request for a certificate of appropriateness, the
  commission  shall  determine  whether  the  proposed   work   would   be
  appropriate  for and consistent with the effectuation of the purposes of
  this chapter. If the commission's determination is in the affirmative on
  such question, it shall grant a certificate of appropriateness,  and  if
  the  commission's  determination  is  in the negative, it shall deny the
  applicant's request, except as otherwise provided in section  25-309  of
  this chapter.
    b.  (1)  In  making  such  determination  with  respect  to  any  such
  application for a permit to construct, reconstruct, alter or demolish an
  improvement in an historic district, the commission shall  consider  (a)
  the  effect  of  the  proposed work in creating, changing, destroying or
  affecting the exterior architectural features of  the  improvement  upon
  which  such  work  is  to  be done, and (b) the relationship between the
  results of such work and the exterior architectural features  of  other,
  neighboring improvements in such district.
    (2)  In appraising such effects and relationship, the commission shall
  consider, in addition to any other pertinent  matters,  the  factors  of
  aesthetic,   historical   and  architectural  values  and  significance,
  architectural style, design, arrangement, texture, material and color.
    (3) All determinations of the commission pursuant to this  subdivision
  b  shall  be  made  subject  to the provisions of section 25-304 of this
  chapter, and the commission, in making any such determination, shall not
  apply any regulation, limitation, determination or restriction as to the
  height and bulk of buildings, the area of yards, courts  or  other  open
  spaces, density of population, the location of trades and industries, or
  location  of  buildings  designed  for  specific  uses,  other  than the
  regulations, limitations, determinations and  restrictions  as  to  such
  matters  prescribed  or  made by or pursuant to applicable provisions of
  law,  exclusive  of  this  chapter;  provided,  however,  that   nothing
  contained  in  such  section  25-304  or  in this subdivision b shall be
  construed as limiting the power of the commission to deny a request  for
  a  certificate  of  appropriateness  for  demolition or alteration of an
  improvement in an historic district (whether or not  such  request  also
  seeks  approval,  in such certificate, of construction or reconstruction
  of any improvement), on the ground that such  demolition  or  alteration
  would be inappropriate for and inconsistent with the effectuation of the
  purposes  of  this  chapter,  with  due  consideration  for  the factors
  hereinabove set forth in this subdivision b.
    c. In making the determination referred to in subdivision  a  of  this
  section  with  respect  to  any  application  for a permit to construct,
  reconstruct, alter or demolish any improvement on a landmark site, other
  than a landmark, the commission shall consider (1) the  effects  of  the
  proposed  work  in  creating,  changing,  destroying  or  affecting  the
  exterior architectural features of the improvement upon which such  work
  is  to be done, (2) the relationship between such exterior architectural
  features, together with such effects,  and  the  exterior  architectural
  features  of  the  landmark,  and (3) the effects of the results of such
  work upon the protection,  enhancement,  perpetuation  and  use  of  the
  landmark  on such site. In appraising such effects and relationship, the

  commission shall consider, in addition to any other  pertinent  matters,
  the factors mentioned in paragraph two of subdivision b of this section.
    d.  In  making  the determination referred to in subdivision a of this
  section  with  respect  to  an  application  for  a  permit  to   alter,
  reconstruct  or  demolish  a landmark, the commission shall consider the
  effects  of  the  proposed  work  upon  the   protection,   enhancement,
  perpetuation  and  use  of  the  exterior architectural features of such
  landmark which cause it  to  possess  a  special  character  or  special
  historical or aesthetic interest or value.
    e.  In  making  the determination referred to in subdivision a of this
  section  with  respect  to  an  application  for  a  permit  to   alter,
  reconstruct  or demolish an improvement containing an interior landmark,
  the commission shall consider the effects of the proposed work upon  the
  protection,   enhancement,   perpetuation   and   use  of  the  interior
  architectural features of such  interior  landmark  which  cause  it  to
  possess  a special character or special historical or aesthetic interest
  or value.
