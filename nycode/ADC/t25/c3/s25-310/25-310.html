Section 25-310

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 25-310 Regulation of minor work. a. (1) Except as otherwise provided
  in  section  25-312 of this chapter, it shall be unlawful for any person
  in charge of an improvement located on a landmark site or in an historic
  district or containing an interior landmark to perform  any  minor  work
  thereon,  or  to  cause or permit such work to be performed, and for any
  other person to perform any such  work  thereon  or  cause  same  to  be
  performed,  unless  the commission has issued a permit, pursuant to this
  section, authorizing such work.
    (2) It shall be  unlawful  for  any  person  in  charge  of  any  such
  improvement to maintain same or cause or permit same to be maintained in
  the condition created by any work done in violation of the provisions of
  paragraph one of this subdivision a.
    b.  The  owner  of an improvement desiring to obtain such a permit, or
  any person authorized by the owner to perform such work, may  file  with
  the  commission an application for such permit, which shall include such
  description of the proposed work, as the commission may  prescribe.  The
  applicant  shall  submit  such  other  information  with  respect to the
  proposed work as the commission may  from  time  to  time  require.  The
  commission shall promptly transmit such application to the department of
  buildings,  which  shall,  as promptly as is practicable, certify to the
  commission whether a permit for  such  proposed  work,  issued  by  such
  department, is required by law. If such department certifies that such a
  permit  is  required,  the  commission  shall deny such application, and
  shall promptly give notice of such determination to  the  applicant.  If
  such   department  certifies  that  no  such  permit  is  required,  the
  commission shall determine such application as hereinafter provided.
    c. (1) The commission shall determine:
    (a) Whether the proposed work would  change,  destroy  or  affect  any
  exterior  architectural  feature of an improvement located on a landmark
  site or in an historic district or interior architectural feature of  an
  improvement containing an interior landmark; and
    (b)  If  such  work  would  have  such  effect,  whether judged by the
  standards set forth in subdivisions b, c, d and e of section  25-307  of
  this  chapter  with  respect to an improvement of similar classification
  hereunder, such work would be appropriate for and  consistent  with  the
  effectuation of the purposes of this chapter.
    (2)   If   the   commission  determines  the  question  set  forth  in
  subparagraph (a) of paragraph one of this subdivision c in the negative,
  or determines the  question  set  forth  in  subparagraph  (b)  of  such
  paragraph  in  the affirmative, it shall grant such permit, and it shall
  deny  such  permit  if  it  determines  such  question  set   forth   in
  subparagraph  (a)  in  the  affirmative and determines such question set
  forth in subparagraph (b) in the negative.
    d. The procedure of the commission in making  its  determination  with
  respect  to  any such application shall be as prescribed in subparagraph
  two of subdivision a of section 25-306 of this chapter, except that  any
  period  of  thirty  days referred to in such subparagraph shall, for the
  purposes of this subdivision d, be deemed to be twenty days.
    e. The provisions  of  this  section  shall  be  inapplicable  to  any
  improvement mentioned in subdivision a of section 25-318 of this chapter
  and to any city-aided project.
