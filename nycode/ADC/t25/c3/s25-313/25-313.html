<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  25-313  Public  hearings; conferences. a. The commission shall give
  notice of any public hearing which it is required or authorized to  hold
  under  the  provisions of this chapter by publication in the City Record
  for at least ten days immediately prior thereto.
    The owner of any improvement parcel on which a landmark or a  proposed
  landmark  is  situated or which is a part of a landmark site or proposed
  landmark site  or  which  contains  an  interior  landmark  or  proposed
  interior  landmark,  or any property which includes a scenic landmark or
  proposed scenic landmark shall be given notice  of  any  public  hearing
  relating  to  the  designation of such proposed landmark, landmark site,
  interior landmark or scenic landmark, the amendment to  any  designation
  thereof  or  the  proposed  rescission  of  any designation or amendment
  thereto. Such notice may be served by the commission by registered  mail
  addressed  to  the  owner  or  owners  at his or her or their last known
  address or addresses, as the same appear in the records of the office of
  the commissioner of finance or if there is no name in such records, such
  notice may be served by ordinary mail addressed to "Owner" at the street
  address of the improvement parcel or property in  question.  Failure  by
  the  commission  to give such notices shall not invalidate or affect any
  proceedings pursuant to this chapter relating to such improvement parcel
  or property.
    b.  At  any  such  public  hearing,  the  commission  shall  afford  a
  reasonable  opportunity for the presentation of facts and the expression
  of views by those desiring to be heard, and may, in its discretion, take
  the testimony of witnesses and receive evidence; provided, however, that
  the commission, in determining any matter as to which any  such  hearing
  is  held,  shall  not  be confined to consideration of the facts, views,
  testimony or evidence submitted at such hearing.
    c. The commission may delegate to any member or  members  thereof  the
  power  to  conduct  any  such  public hearing and to hold any conference
  required to be held under the provisions of sections 25-306  and  25-310
  of this chapter.
    d.  The  commission, may, in its discretion, direct that notice of any
  such public hearing on a request for a certificate  of  appropriateness,
  or  on  any  plan  formulated  by the commission in relation thereto, be
  given by the applicant to such owners of property in the neighborhood of
  the improvement or improvement parcel to which such request relates,  as
  the  commission deems proper. When so directed, the applicant shall mail
  a notice of such hearing to such owners, at their last known  addresses,
  as  the  same appear in the records of the office of the commissioner of
  finance, and shall likewise mail a notice of such hearing to persons who
  have filed written requests for  such  notice  with  the  commission.  A
  reasonable  period  of  time,  as  prescribed  by the regulations of the
  commission, shall be afforded the applicant for giving  notice  of  such
  hearing  to such owners and persons. Any failure to give or receive such
  notice shall not invalidate any such hearing or any  determination  made
  by the commission with respect to such request for a certificate or with
  respect to such plan.
