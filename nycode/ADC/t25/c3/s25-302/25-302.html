  financing.
    (3) For the purposes of this subdivision v:
    (a)  Net  annual return shall be the amount by which the earned income
  yielded by the  improvement  parcel  during  a  test  year  exceeds  the
  operating  expenses  of such parcel during such year, excluding mortgage
  interest and amortization, and excluding allowances for obsolescence and
  reserves, but including an allowance for depreciation of two per  centum
  of  the assessed value of the improvement, exclusive of the land, or the
