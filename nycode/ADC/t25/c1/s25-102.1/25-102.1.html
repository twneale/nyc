Section 25-102.1

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  25-102.1  City  map; street and park names. a. Unless the local law
  specifically provides otherwise, any local law naming  a  street,  park,
  playground or portion thereof, or any facility or structure, located and
  laid  out  on  the  city map, that does not bear a name indicated on the
  city map shall not be construed to require the addition of such name  on
  the  city  map; provided, however, that the name given by such local law
  shall be posted on a sign placed at the location of such  street,  park,
  playground or portion thereof, or any facility or structure, located and
  laid out on the city map.
    b. Unless the local law specifically provides otherwise, any local law
  changing  the  name of a street, park, playground or portion thereof, or
  any facility or structure, located and laid out on the  city  map,  that
  bears a name indicated on the city map shall not be construed to require
  a  change  in  such  name  as it is indicated on the city map; provided,
  however, that in the case of a local law changing the name of  a  street
  or  portion thereof, the name added by such local law shall be posted on
  a sign placed adjacent to or near a sign bearing the name of such street
  or portion thereof indicated on the city map.
    c. The department of transportation may establish different colors for
  signs bearing a street name not officially indicated on the city map and
  signs bearing a street name officially indicated on the  city  map,  and
  may  provide  for the replacement of any sign bearing a dual name by two
  separate signs of such color as the department shall determine.
