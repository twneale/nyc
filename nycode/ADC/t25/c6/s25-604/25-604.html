    &sect; 25-604 Jamaica Center Mall Special Assessment District.  a. The city
  council  having  determined, pursuant to subdivision b of section 25-410
  of chapter four of this title, that it is  in  the  public  interest  to
  authorize  an  increase  in  the  amount  to be expended annually in the
  Jamaica Center mall special assessment district, and the council  having
  determined  further  that  the tax and debt limits prescribed in section
  25-412 of chapter four of this  title  will  not  be  exceeded  by  such
  increased  expenditure,  there  is hereby authorized in subdistrict 1 of
  such district an annual expenditure of five hundred ninety-five thousand
  five hundred dollars ($595,500) and in subdistrict 2 of such district an
  annual expenditure of one hundred forty-two thousand dollars ($142,000).
    b. The amount of such expenditure to be levied upon each  property  in
  subdistrict  1 and subdistrict 2 of such district shall be determined in
  accordance with the method of assessment set forth in the Jamaica Center
  mall special assessment act, as  amended,  provided  that  any  property
  referred to in paragraph b of subdivision 2 of section 5 of such act for
  which  an  adjusted levy was made in fiscal year 1991, may have its levy
  adjusted in subsequent fiscal years using the same method of  assessment
  for such adjustment as was used in fiscal year 1991. If such adjustments
  are  made  the levy for the remaining properties in the subdistricts may
  be adjusted accordingly.
