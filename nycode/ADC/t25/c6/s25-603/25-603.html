Section 25-603

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  25-603  Nassau Street Mall Special Assessment District. a. The city
  council having determined, pursuant to subdivision b of  section  25-410
  of  chapter  four  of  this  title, that it is in the public interest to
  authorize an increase in the amount  to  be  expended  annually  in  the
  Nassau  street  mall special assessment district, and the council having
  determined further that the tax and debt limits  prescribed  in  section
  25-412  of  chapter  four  of  this  title  will not be exceeded by such
  increased expenditure, there is hereby authorized in  subdistrict  A  of
  such  district  an  annual expenditure of one hundred forty-two thousand
  five hundred dollars ($142,500) and in subdistrict B of such district an
  annual expenditure of fifty-six thousand dollars ($56,000).
    b. The amount of such expenditure to be levied upon each  property  in
  subdistrict  A and subdistrict B of such district shall be determined in
  accordance with the method of assessment set forth in the Nassau  street
  mall  special  assessment  act,  as  amended, provided that any property
  referred to in paragraph b of subdivision 2 of section 5 of such act for
  which an adjusted levy was made in fiscal year 1991, may have  its  levy
  adjusted  in subsequent fiscal years using the same method of assessment
  for such adjustment as was used in fiscal year 1991. If such adjustments
  are made the levy for the remaining properties in the  subdistricts  may
  be adjusted accordingly.
