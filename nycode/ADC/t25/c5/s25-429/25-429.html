    &sect;  25-429  East  Brooklyn  business  improvement district. a. The city
  council having determined, pursuant to subdivision b of  section  25-410

  the council having determined further  that  the  tax  and  debt  limits
  prescribed  in  section 25-412 of chapter four of this title will not be
  exceeded by such increased expenditure, there is  hereby  authorized  in
  such district an annual expenditure of three hundred forty-nine thousand
  five hundred dollars ($349,500).
    b.  The  amount of such expenditure to be levied upon each property in
  the district shall be  determined  in  accordance  with  the  method  of
  assessment  set forth in the East Brooklyn business improvement district
  plan.
