Section 25-409

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 25-409 Publication; filing; judicial review.
    (a)  The  city  clerk  shall  cause  a certified copy of the local law
  adopted pursuant to the  provisions  of  this  chapter  establishing  or
  extending  any district, or increasing the maximum total amount proposed
  to be expended for the improvement in  any  district  or  extension,  or
  changing  the method of assessment, or authorizing the district to incur
  debt to provide for  additional  improvements  or  services  within  the
  district, to be duly recorded in the city clerk's office within ten days
  after  such local law becomes effective. When so recorded this local law
  shall be presumptive evidence of the regularity of the  proceedings  for
  the  establishment  or  extension  of  the  district, of the proceedings
  instituted for the construction of any  improvement  and  of  all  other
  actions taken in relation to it.
    (b)  Within  ten  days after the local law becomes effective, the city
  clerk shall, in addition to any other filing required by  law,  cause  a
  certified  copy  thereof  to  be  filed  in  the  office  of  the  state
  comptroller at Albany, New York, and within two weeks  thereafter  shall
  cause  a  copy  of the local law or a summary thereof to be published at
  least once in the City Record or a newspaper of general  circulation  in
  the city.
    (c)  This  local law shall be final and conclusive unless a proceeding
  to review is commenced in accordance with this subdivision.  Any  person
  aggrieved  by  any  local  law adopted pursuant to this chapter may seek
  judicial review of the local law  in  the  manner  provided  by  article
  seventy-eight  of  the  civil  practice  law  and  rules,  provided  the
  proceeding is  commenced  within  thirty  days  from  the  date  of  the
  publication  of  the  copy  or  summary  of  the  local  law pursuant to
  subdivision (b) of this section. No  review  shall  be  had  unless  the
  petitioner shall give an undertaking approved by the supreme court, or a
  justice  thereof,  as to form, amount and sufficiency of sureties, that,
  in the event of failure to modify the local law, he or she will  pay  to
  the  city all costs and expenses as are incurred by it on account of the
  proceedings, as shall be determined by the court. In the event that upon
  this review there shall be any modification by the court  of  the  local
  law,  the court shall direct the modification by judgment which shall be
  final and conclusive, and the city clerk shall cause the judgment to  be
  recorded  and  filed  in the same places and manner as was the local law
  which was modified.
