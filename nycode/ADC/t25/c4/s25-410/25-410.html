  which the district charge is based, or an increase only in the amount to
  be  expended  annually  for  improvements,  services,  maintenance   and

  which provide for an increase in the total maximum amount to be expended
  for  improvements in the district, may be adopted by local law, provided
  that the city council shall, after a public hearing, determine  that  it
  is   in   the  public  interest  to  authorize  the  district  to  incur
  indebtedness to provide for additional improvements or to  increase  the
  maximum total amount to be expended for improvements in the district and
  that  the  tax  and  debt  limits  prescribed  in section 25-412 of this
