    &sect;  25-415  Dissolution.  (a)  Any  district  established  or  extended
  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  this  chapter,  where  there  is   no
  indebtedness,  outstanding and unpaid, incurred to accomplish any of the
  purposes of the district, may be dissolved by  local  law  of  the  city
  council  upon  its  own  motion  or upon the written petition of (1) the
  owners of at least fifty-one percent  or  more  of  the  total  assessed
  valuation  of  all benefited real property included in the boundaries of
  the district and (2)  at  least  fifty-one  percent  of  the  owners  of
  benefited  real  property  within the area included in the district. The
  city council shall request  and  consider  the  recommendations  of  the
  district  management  association  concerning  any proposed dissolution;
  provided that if the association has not  submitted  recommendations  to
  the  city  council  within  sixty  days after request therefor, the city
  council may adopt any such proposed dissolution without considering such
  recommendations. In the event of dissolution, all assets of the district
  shall revert to the city.
    (b) A certified copy of the order of dissolution shall be  filed  with
  the state comptroller at Albany, New York.
