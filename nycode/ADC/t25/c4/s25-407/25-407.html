Section 25-407

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 25-407 Establishment or extension of the district.
    (a)  Not earlier than thirty days after the conclusion of the last day
  of the public hearing held pursuant to section 25-406 of  this  chapter,
  the city council shall determine:
    (1) whether the notice of hearing for all hearings required to be held
  was published and mailed as required by law and is otherwise sufficient;
    (2)  except  as  otherwise provided in section 25-403 of this chapter,
  whether all the real property within  the  boundaries  of  the  proposed
  district  or  extension will benefit from the establishment or extension
  of the district;
    (3) whether all the real property benefited  is  included  within  the
  limits of the proposed district or extension; and
    (4)  whether  the establishment or extension of the district is in the
  public interest.
    (b) (1) If the city council shall determine the question of  paragraph
  four  of  subdivision  (a)  of  this  section in the negative, or if the
  requisite number of owners shall have filed their objections as provided
  in section 25-406 of this  chapter,  the  city  council  shall  adopt  a
  resolution  disapproving the establishment or extension of the district,
  stating the reasons for its determination and  enter  the  same  in  the
  minutes  of its proceedings. Thereafter no plan for the establishment or
  extension of a district to include any part of the property proposed  to
  be  included  in the disapproved district may be prepared as provided in
  section 25-405 of this chapter until the expiration of at least one year
  from the date of disapproval.
    (2) If the city council shall find  that  notice  was  incorrectly  or
  insufficiently  given  or  that, except as otherwise provided in section
  25-403 of this chapter, any part or portion of the real property  within
  the  boundaries  of  the proposed district or extension is not benefited
  thereby or that certain property benefited thereby has not been included
  therein, it shall call a further hearing at a definite  place  and  time
  not less than ten nor more than thirty days after this determination. In
  the  resolution  calling  such  hearing,  it shall specify the necessary
  changes, if any, to the boundaries of the proposed district or extension
  to be made in order that, except as otherwise provided in section 25-403
  of this chapter, all of the real property and only that real property as
  is deemed benefited shall be  included  within  the  boundaries  of  the
  proposed  district  or  extension.  Such a further hearing shall also be
  required in the event that  the  city  council  proposes  to  amend  the
  district  plan  to reduce improvements or services or provide additional
  improvements or services not included in the original plan prior to  the
  establishment  of  the  district. Notice of the further hearing shall be
  published and mailed in the manner provided in section  25-406  of  this
  chapter,  except  that,  where boundaries are to be altered, this notice
  shall also specify the manner in which  it  is  proposed  to  alter  the
  boundaries  of  the  proposed district or extension. The further hearing
  shall be conducted in the same manner as the original hearing.
    (c) If and when the city council shall determine  in  the  affirmative
  all  of  the questions set forth in subdivision (a) of this section, and
  provided that the requisite number of owners shall not have objected  as
  provided  in  section  25-406  of this chapter, it may adopt a local law
  approving  the  establishment  or  extension  of  the  district  as  the
  boundaries  shall  be  finally  determined  and  the construction of the
  improvement or providing of the service in the district. Such local  law
  shall  become effective only upon compliance with section 25-408 of this
  chapter.
    (d) Upon the recommendation of the district management association and
  after a public hearing, the city council may adopt a local  law  at  any

  time  prior  to  or  after the establishment of a district to change the
  method of assessment as set forth in the plan.  Notice  of  such  public
  hearing  and  a description of the proposed change shall be given in the
  manner set forth in section 25-406 of this chapter.
