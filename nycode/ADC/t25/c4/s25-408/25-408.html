  indebtedness, whether or not appropriations have been realized as  cash;
  the   amount   of   indebtedness  proposed  to  be  contracted  for  the
  improvement, and the amounts, purposes and probable date of issuance  of
  any  bonds,  bond  anticipation  notes, capital notes, deferred payments
  notes and budget notes which the city has authorized to  be  issued  but
  which in fact have not been issued to date;
    (2)  a  statement  of the total assessed valuation of the taxable real

  from the state comptroller of his or her determination.
