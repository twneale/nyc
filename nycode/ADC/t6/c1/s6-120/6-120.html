    &sect;  6-120  Standards  and  specifications. The commissioner of citywide
  administrative services shall have  power  to  use  the  laboratory  and
  engineering  facilities of any agency, together with the technical staff
  thereof, in connection with work of preparing and adopting standards and
  written specifications. The commissioner shall consult freely  with  the
  heads  and  other  officials  of the various agencies to determine their
  precise requirements, and shall endeavor to  prescribe  those  standards
  which  meet  the needs of the majority of such agencies. After adoption,
  each standard specification shall, until  revised  or  rescinded,  apply
  alike  in terms and effect to every future purchase and contract for the
  commodity described in such specification. The commissioner of  citywide
  administrative  services,  however,  may exempt any such agency from the
  use of the commodity described in such standard specification.
