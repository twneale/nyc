Section 6-102

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  6-102  Performance  of  contracts. a. Each agency shall require and
  enforce the faithful performance of every contract made by it.
    b. If the contractor or contractors  shall  fail  in  any  respect  to
  fulfill  the  contract within the time limited for its performance, then
  the agency in charge thereof shall  complete  the  same  in  the  manner
  provided  for  in  the  contract. The cost of such completion shall be a
  charge against such delinquent contractor or contractors.
    c. If any work shall be abandoned by any contractor,  the  appropriate
  agency,  if the best interest of the city be thereby served, and subject
  to the approval of the board of estimate,  may  adopt  all  subcontracts
  made by such contractor for such work. All subcontractors shall be bound
  by  such  adoption.  The  agency  shall  readvertise  and relet the work
  specified in the original contract, exclusive  of  so  much  thereof  as
  shall be provided for in the subcontracts so adopted.
