    &sect; 6-133 Notification of project cost increases. a. For the purposes of
  this  section,  "agency" means a city, county, borough, or other office,
  position,  administration,  department,  division,  bureau,   board   or
  commission,  or  a corporation, institution or agency of government, the
  expenses of which are paid in whole or in part from the city treasury.
    b. If an agency that has entered  into  a  contract  for  construction
  and/or  services  with  a  maximum  expenditure of more than ten million
  dollars in connection with a project  included  in  the  capital  budget
  enters into a contract modification or extension that results in a total
  revised  maximum  expenditure that exceeds the original contract maximum
  expenditure by twenty percent  or  more,  the  mayor  shall  notify  the
  council of such contract modification or extension, including details of
  the basis for and scope of the estimated additional costs.
    c.  Once  such  notification  has  been  provided  for a contract, any
  additional modifications or extensions of such  contract  that  increase
  the  maximum  expenditure  more  than ten percent over the total revised
  maximum expenditure shall trigger new notification to the council.
    d. Notifications pursuant to this  section  shall  be  provided  on  a
  quarterly  basis  sorted by project within forty-five days of the end of
  the calendar  quarter  within  which  the  comptroller  registered  such
  contract action.
