Section 11-308

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  11-308  Apportionment of assessment. If a sum of money in gross has
  been or shall be assessed upon any lands or premises in  the  city,  any
  person or persons claiming any divided or undivided part thereof may pay
  such  part  of  the  sums of money so assessed, also of the interest and
  charges due or charged thereon, as the commissioner of finance may  deem
  to be just and equitable. The remainder of the sum of money so assessed,
  together with the interest and charges, shall be a lien upon the residue
  of the land and premises only, and the tax lien upon such residue may be
  sold  in  pursuance  of  the  provisions of this chapter, to satisfy the
  residue of such assessment, interest, or charges thereon,  in  the  same
  manner  as  though  the residue of such assessment had been imposed upon
  such residue of such land or premises.
