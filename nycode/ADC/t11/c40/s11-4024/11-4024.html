Section 11-4024

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  11-4024  Seizure  and  forfeiture  of  taxed  and  lawfully stamped
  cigarettes sold or possessed by unlicensed retail or  wholesale  dealers
  and  flavored tobacco products. (a) Whenever a police officer designated
  in section 1.20 of  the  criminal  procedure  law  or  a  peace  officer
  employed  by the department of finance, including but not limited to the
  sheriff, undersheriff or  deputy  sheriffs  of  the  city  of  New  York
  designated  as  peace officers in subdivision two of section 2.10 of the
  criminal procedure law, shall discover (1) any cigarettes subject to any
  tax provided by chapter thirteen of this title, and upon which  the  tax
  has  been  paid  and the stamps affixed as required by such chapter, but
  such cigarettes are sold, offered for sale or possessed by a  person  in
  violation  of section 11-1303, 17-703 or 20-202 of this code, or (2) any
  flavored tobacco product that is sold, offered  for  sale  or  possessed
  with  intent  to sell in violation of section 17-715 of this code, he or
  she is hereby authorized and  empowered  forthwith  to  seize  and  take
  possession of such cigarettes or flavored tobacco product, together with
  any  vending  machine or receptacle in which such cigarettes or flavored
  tobacco product are held for sale. Such cigarettes or  flavored  tobacco
  product,  vending machine or receptacle seized by such police officer or
  such peace officer shall be turned over to the commissioner of finance.
    (b) The seized cigarettes or flavored tobacco product and any  vending
  machine  or  receptacle seized therewith, but not the money contained in
  such vending machine or receptacle, shall thereupon be forfeited to  the
  city,  unless  the person from whom the seizure is made, or the owner of
  such seized cigarettes, flavored tobacco  product,  vending  machine  or
  receptacle,  or  any  other  person having an interest in such property,
  shall within ten days of such seizure,  apply  to  the  commissioner  of
  finance  for  a  hearing  to  determine the propriety of the seizure, or
  unless the commissioner of finance shall on his own motion  release  the
  seized   cigarettes,   flavored  tobacco  product,  vending  machine  or
  receptacle. After such hearing the commissioner of  finance  shall  give
  notice   of  his  decision  to  the  petitioner.  The  decision  of  the
  commissioner   shall    be    reviewable    for    error,    illegality,
  unconstitutionality or any other reason whatsoever by a proceeding under
  article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules.
    (c)  The  commissioner  of finance may, within a reasonable time after
  the forfeiture to the city of such vending machine or  receptacle  under
  this  section,  upon publication of a notice to such effect for at least
  five successive days, in a newspaper  published  or  circulated  in  the
  city,  sell  such forfeited vending machine or receptacle at public sale
  and pay the proceeds into the general fund  of  the  city.  Such  seized
  vending  machine  or  receptacle  may be sold prior to forfeiture if the
  owner of the  seized  property  consents  to  the  sale.  Cigarettes  or
  flavored  tobacco product forfeited to the city under this section shall
  be  destroyed  or  used  for  law  enforcement  purposes,  except   that
  cigarettes   that  violate,  or  are  suspected  of  violating,  federal
  trademark laws or import laws shall not  be  used  for  law  enforcement
  purposes.  If the commissioner determines the cigarettes forfeited under
  this  section  may  not  be  used  for  law  enforcement  purposes,  the
  commissioner  of  finance  must,  within  a  reasonable  time  after the
  forfeiture to the city of such cigarettes, upon publication of a  notice
  to  such effect for at least five successive days, prior to destruction,
  in a newspaper  published  or  circulated  in  the  city,  destroy  such
  forfeited cigarettes.
    (d)  In  the  alternative,  the commissioner of finance, on reasonable
  notice by mail or otherwise, may permit the person from whom  a  seizure
  of  cigarettes  or flavored tobacco product under this section was made,
  to redeem any vending machine or receptacle seized with such  cigarettes

  or flavored tobacco product, or may permit the owner of any such vending
  machine  or receptacle to redeem the same, upon the payment of any civil
  penalty  imposed  pursuant  to  chapter  seven  of  title  seventeen  or
  subchapter one of chapter two of title twenty of this code and the costs
  incurred in such proceeding.
