    &sect;  11-517 Extensions of time. (a) General. The commissioner of finance
  may grant a reasonable extension of time for payment of tax or estimated
  tax (or  any  installment),  or  for  filing  any  return,  declaration,
  statement,  or other document required pursuant to this chapter, on such
  terms and conditions as it may require. Except for  a  taxpayer  who  is

  declaration, statement or other document, shall exceed six months.
    (b) Furnishing of security. If any extension of time  is  granted  for

  the taxpayer to furnish a bond  or  other  security  in  an  amount  not
  exceeding  twice  the amount for which the extension of time for payment
  is granted, on such terms and conditions as the commissioner of  finance
  may require.
