Section 11-2326

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 11-2326 Liability for surcharge.  (a) Each service supplier customer
  who  is subject to the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to the
  city for the surcharge until it has been paid to the city,  except  that
  payment to a service supplier is sufficient to relieve the customer from
  further liability for such surcharge.
    (b)  The  service  supplier shall have no obligation to take any legal
  action to enforce the collection of any surcharge. However, whenever the
  service supplier remits the funds collected  as  the  surcharge  to  the
  city,  it  shall  also provide the city with the name and address of any
  customer refusing or failing  to  pay  the  surcharge  imposed  by  this
  chapter and shall state the amount of such surcharge remaining unpaid.
