<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  17-912 Department rules. The department shall promulgate such rules
  as may be necessary for the implementation of this chapter.  Such  rules
  shall  incorporate  work practices that are no less protective of public
  health than those set forth in section 173.14  (d)  and  (e)  and  those
  parts  of  subdivision  b  of  the  health  code applicable thereto or a
  successor rule, and shall include a requirement  that  lead-contaminated
  dust clearance testing be performed at the completion of such work. Such
  rules  shall require that such work be performed by a person who has, at
  a minimum, successfully completed a course on lead-safe  work  practices
  given  by  or  on  behalf  of  the  department  or, by the United States
  environmental protection agency or an entity authorized by  it  to  give
  such  course,  or  by  the United States department of housing and urban
  development or an entity authorized by it  to  give  such  course.  Such
  rules shall not apply where such work disturbs surfaces of less than (a)
  two  square feet of peeling lead-based paint per room or (b) ten percent
  of the total surface area of peeling paint on a type of component with a
  small surface area, such as a window sill or door frame.
