Section 17-401

    &sect;  17-401  Findings  and declaration. The council declares that due to
  the irreversible nature of the sterilization procedure, it is  essential
  that   the   patient   fully   comprehends   the  effects  and  possible
  complications of the operation. The patient  should  have  a  reasonable
  time to consider his or her decision and possible alternative methods of
  contraception  before the operation is performed. Since it is within the
  purview of the public policy  of  the  city  to  preserve,  protect  and
  improve the public health, safety and welfare, it is imperative that the
  council establish standards governing the performance of sterilizations.
