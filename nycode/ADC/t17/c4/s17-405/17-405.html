    1.  Initial  consent  may not be elicited from a female patient during
  admission or hospitalization for childbirth or abortion.
    2. An informational session conducted by a counselor, who is  not  the
  operating  physician,  must  precede  the  patient's consent. During the

  signed consent form shall be provided the patient.

  performed  each  patient  must  give  written  affirmation of his or her
  informed consent to the sterilization.
