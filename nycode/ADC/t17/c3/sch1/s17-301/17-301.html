    * &sect;  17-301 Language preference for inspections. Every application for
  a license or a permit, or the renewal  of  an  existing  license  or  an
  existing  permit  to  be  issued  by  the  commissioner pursuant to this
  chapter shall provide an opportunity for the applicant to  indicate  the
  language  in  which  such  applicant  would  prefer  that inspections in
  connection with such license or permit be conducted or alternatively for
  which language interpretation  services  be  provide.  Nothing  in  this
  subdivision  nor  any  failure  to  comply with such preference shall be
  construed so as to create a cause of action or constitute a  defense  in
  any legal, administrative, or other proceeding.
