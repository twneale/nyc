  whether or not such tobacco or substance  is  flavored,  adulterated  or

  component part thereof, including, but not limited to, tastes or  aromas
  relating to any fruit, chocolate, vanilla, honey, candy, cocoa, dessert,
  alcoholic  beverage,  herb  or spice; provided, however, that no tobacco
  product shall be determined  to  have  a  characterizing  flavor  solely
  because  of  the  use  of  additives  or  flavorings or the provision of
  ingredient information.
    c. "Component part" means any element of a tobacco product, including,
  but not limited to, the tobacco, filter and paper, but not including any

    e.  "Flavored  tobacco  product"  means  any  tobacco  product  or any
  component part thereof  that  contains  a  constituent  that  imparts  a

  by the manufacturer of a tobacco product, or by any person authorized or
  permitted by the manufacturer to make or disseminate  public  statements
  concerning  such  tobacco  product,  that  such  tobacco  product has or
  produces a characterizing flavor shall constitute  presumptive  evidence
  that the tobacco product is a flavored tobacco product.
    f.  "Herbal cigarette" means a product that is meant to be smoked like
  a cigarette but is composed of one or more herbs and  does  not  contain
  tobacco.
