  17-703.2,  17-704,  17-705  or  subdivision  a  or  b  of section 17-706
  occurring on a different day and any subsequent violations occurring  on

  any  person  who engages in business as a retail dealer shall be subject
  to the mandatory revocation of his or her  cigarette  license  for  such
  place  of  business.  Any violation of section 17-703, 17-703.2, 17-704,

  violations by such license holder and by any subsequent  license  holder
  at  the  same  place  of  business  unless the subsequent license holder
  provides the commissioner of  the  department  that  has  commenced  the
  proceeding  to recover a civil penalty pursuant to subdivision b of this
  section with adequate documentation demonstrating  that  the  subsequent
  license holder acquired the premises or business through an arm's length
  transaction  as  defined  in  subdivision e of this section and that the
  sale or lease was not conducted, in whole or in part, for the purpose of
  permitting the original licensee to avoid the effect  of  violations  on
  the  premises.  A cigarette license shall be revoked at the same hearing
  at which a retail dealer is found  liable  for  a  second  violation  or
  subsequent  violations at the same place of business within a three-year

    (6) Any person who violates section 17-708 shall be liable for a civil

    b. A proceeding to recover any civil penalty  authorized  pursuant  to
  the  provisions  of  subdivision  a  of  this section for a violation of
  section 17-703, 17-703.1, 17-703.2, 17-704, 17-705  or  17-706  of  this
  subchapter  shall  be  commenced by the service of a notice of violation
  which shall be returnable to  the  health  tribunal  at  the  office  of

  administrative  trials  and  hearings where the department of health and
  mental hygiene issues such notice,  the  adjudication  division  of  the
  department  of  consumer  affairs  where that department or a designated
  employee   of   any   authorizing  agency  issues  such  notice,  or  an
  adjudication division of the department of finance or the administrative
  tribunal selected by the commissioner of finance where the department of
  finance issues such notice. Such notice shall contain a  statement  that
  any  hearing  for  a  second violation or subsequent violation of any of
  such sections at the same place of business within a  three-year  period
  shall  also constitute a hearing for the revocation of a retail dealer's
  cigarette license where the retail dealer is found to be in violation of
  any such sections. The department of  health  and  mental  hygiene,  the
  department  of  consumer  affairs  and  the  department of finance shall
  notify each other within thirty days of a  final  determination  that  a
  retail  dealer  has  been  found  to  be in violation of section 17-703,
  17-703.1, 17-703.2, 17-704, 17-705  or  17-706  of  this  subchapter.  A
  proceeding  to  recover  any  civil  penalty  authorized pursuant to the
  provisions of subdivision a of this section for a violation  of  section
  17-708  shall  be  returnable  to  the  health tribunal at the office of
  administrative trials and hearings.  Such tribunal shall have the  power
  to  impose  the  civil  penalties  prescribed  by  subdivision a of this
  section.  The  adjudication  division  of  the  department  of  consumer
  affairs,  the health tribunal at the office of administrative trials and
  hearings and an adjudication division of the department  of  finance  or
  the  administrative  tribunal  selected  by  the commissioner of finance
  shall have the  power  to  impose  the  civil  penalties  prescribed  by
  subdivision  a  of  this  section  for  a  violation  of section 17-703,
  17-703.1, 17-703.2, 17-704, 17-705 or 17-706 of this subchapter.
    c. The penalties provided by subdivision a of this section shall be in
  addition to any other penalty imposed by any other provision of  law  or
  rule promulgated thereunder.
    d.  Whenever  any  person  has  engaged in any acts or practices which
  constitute a violation of any provision of this  subchapter  or  of  any
  rule promulgated thereunder, the city may make application to a court of
  competent jurisdiction for an order enjoining such acts or practices and
  for  an  order granting a temporary or permanent injunction, restraining
  order or other order enjoining such acts or practices.
    e. For purposes of this section, "arm's length  transaction"  means  a
  sale  of  a fee or all undivided interests in real property, or lease of
  any part thereof, or a sale  of  a  business,  in  good  faith  and  for
  valuable consideration, that reflects the fair market value of such real
  property or lease, or business, in the open market, between two informed
  and   willing   parties,  where  neither  is  under  any  compulsion  to
  participate in the transaction, unaffected  by  any  unusual  conditions
  indicating  a reasonable possibility that the sale or lease was made for
  the purpose of permitting the original licensee to avoid the  effect  of
  violations  on  the  premises.  The  following  sales or leases shall be
  presumed  not  to  be  arm's   length   transactions   unless   adequate
  documentation  is  provided demonstrating that the sale or lease was not
  conducted, in whole or in  part,  for  the  purpose  of  permitting  the
  original licensee to avoid the effect of violations on the premises:
    (1) a sale between relatives; or
    (2) a sale between related companies or partners in a business; or
    (3)  a  sale  or  lease  affected by other facts or circumstances that
  would indicate that the sale or lease is entered into  for  the  primary
  purpose  of  permitting  the  original  licensee  to avoid the effect of
  violations on the premises, such as a sale or lease entered  into  while

  there  are  violations  pending against the original licensee that could
  result in revocation or suspension of the license.
    f.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions of subdivision a of this section,
  the mandatory revocation of a license for  a  second  offense  shall  be
  waived  if,  upon the submission of satisfactory proof, the commissioner
  determines that the person or persons who committed the violations which
  are the basis for the mandatory revocation acted against the  licensee's
  will  in  committing  such  violations,  the licensee utilized extensive
  precautionary measures  to  prevent  violations  of  the  provisions  of
  sections  17-704,  17-705  and 17-706 of this code, and the licensee has
  terminated any financial or employment relationship with each person who
  committed the violations which are the basis of the mandatory revocation
  of its license  or  has  taken  other  significant  disciplinary  action
  against  such  persons.  The  commissioner  shall  not  determine that a
  licensee utilized extensive precautionary measures to prevent violations
  of the provisions of sections 17-704, 17-705 and  17-706  of  this  code
  unless  the  licensee  submits satisfactory proof demonstrating that the
  licensee had, prior to the second violation which is the basis  for  the
  mandatory revocation of its license, done the following:
    (1)  implemented  a  clear policy requiring all persons working in the
  place of business to strictly comply with  the  provisions  of  sections
  17-704, 17-705 and 17-706 of this code and permitting persons working in
  the  place  of  business to complete a tobacco product sales transaction
  only after establishing the age of a prospective  purchaser  of  tobacco
  products  through identification that has been verified for authenticity
  or through photographic identification as required by section 17-706  of
  this code; and
    (2)  trained  all  persons  working in the place of business to comply
  with any such policy before they are allowed to sell tobacco products to
  the public; and
    (3) monitored the performance of  persons  working  in  the  place  of
  business  to  ensure  that they adhere to such policy, or, in accordance
  with  rules  promulgated  by  the   commissioner,   conducted   periodic
  retraining of persons working in the place of business.
    g.  Any  retail  dealer who fails to pay (1) any civil penalty imposed
  under chapter thirteen of title eleven of the code for the violation  of
  any  provision  thereunder,  or (2) any civil penalty imposed under this
  chapter for any violation thereof or under section 17-176.1  or  section
  17-177  of  this  title  for  any  violation  of such sections, shall be
  subject to suspension of his or her retail dealer license for the  place
  of  business  where the violation occurred until such retail dealer pays
  all such civil penalties.  Such  retail  dealer  license  shall  not  be
  renewed  until  such  retail  dealer  pays  all  such civil penalties. A
  proceeding  to  suspend  a  retail  dealer  license  pursuant  to   this
  subdivision  may  be commenced by the department to which payment of the
  penalty is  due,  in  the  same  manner  as  a  proceeding  pursuant  to
  subdivision   b  of  this  section  to  recover  a  civil  penalty.  The
  adjudication division of the department of consumer affairs, the  health
  tribunal  at  the  office  of  administrative trials and hearings and an
  adjudication division of the department of finance or the administrative
  tribunal selected by the commissioner of finance shall have the power to
  suspend a retail dealer's license pursuant to this subdivision.
