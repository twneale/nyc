    * &sect;   17-1504   Food  Service  Establishment  Consultative  Inspection
  Program.  a. The department shall implement  a  consultative  inspection
  program for food service establishments.
    b.  Such consultative inspections shall be optional, and performed for
  educational and informational purposes only. A  consultative  inspection
  shall  not  result  in  a  notice  of violation being issued for general
  violations, critical  violations,  imminent  health  hazards  or  public
  health  hazards.  A  consultative  inspection  shall  not  impact a food
  service establishment's inspection cycle.
    c. Upon completion of a consultative inspection, the  inspector  shall
  review  the  results  with  the  owner  or  operator of the food service
  establishment, and advise the owner or operator of potential  violations
  and how to remedy such violations.
    d.  Nothing  in this section shall prohibit the department from taking
  appropriate action if a food service establishment  fails  to  remedy  a
  public health hazard at the time of the consultative inspection.
    e.  The  department  may  charge  a  fee  which  shall  be set by rule
  promulgated by the commissioner.
    f. The department may schedule the consultative  inspection  based  on
  factors,  set by rule promulgated by the commissioner, including but not
  limited to demand, prioritization according to inspection  history,  and
  the inspection cycle of the food service establishment.
    g.  Within  the  consultative  inspection  program  for  food  service
  establishments, the department shall develop a system for newly licensed
  food service establishments whereby such establishments may schedule the
  consultative inspection prior to their first initial inspections  for  a
  nominal fee which shall be set by rule promulgated by the commissioner.
