  first made an order to vacate such building, if it deem such course just
  and  proper,  may  condemn the same and order it removed. The department
  may institute proceedings in the supreme  court  in  the  city  for  the
  condemnation  of  such  building,  provided,  however, that the owner or
  owners of such building may demand that it be  surveyed  in  the  manner
  provided for in case of unsafe buildings.
