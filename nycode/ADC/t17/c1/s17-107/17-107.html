    &sect;   17-107  Inspection  of  vessels;  removal;  violation  of  orders,
  punishment for. a. An officer or employee of the department shall  visit
  and inspect all vessels coming to the wharves, landing places, or shores
  of  the city, or within three hundred yards thereof, which are suspected
  of having on board any communicable  disease,  or  of  being  likely  to
  communicate such disease to the inhabitants of the city. Such officer or
  employee  shall  report  in writing, stating the vessel so inspected and
  the nature, state, and situation thereof, and his or her opinion  as  to

    b. If the department deem it probable that any  such  disease  may  be
  brought into the city or communicated to the inhabitants thereof, it may
  by  order  direct any vessel lying at a place within three hundred yards
  of any wharf, landing place or shore of the city to be removed at  least
  three  hundred  yards  therefrom  within  six hours after a copy of such
  order, certified by the secretary of the department, shall be  delivered
  to  the  person  or  persons  having  command  of such vessel, or to the
  master, owner or consignee thereof. Every person to whom  such  copy  of
  such order shall be delivered shall forthwith comply with the same.
    c.  Failure  to  comply  with  the  provisions  of  this section shall
  constitute a misdemeanor, punishable by a  fine  of  not  exceeding  two
  hundred  fifty  dollars,  or  imprisonment  not exceeding six months, or
