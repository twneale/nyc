  conjunction with the department of housing preservation and development,

  lead-based paint inspectors  and  supervisors,  (2)  include  background

  supervisor,  as the case may be, and the requirements of sections 173.13
  and 173.14 of the health code or successor rules. The  department  shall
  provide  for  the  continuing  education  of  inspection and supervisory
