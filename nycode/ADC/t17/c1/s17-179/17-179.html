    &sect;  17-179  Department  Screening,  Diagnosis,  and  Treatment.  a. The
  department shall refer to appropriate medical providers any  person  who
  requests  assistance  in  blood  lead  screening,  testing, diagnosis or
  treatment, and upon the request of a parent  or  guardian,  arrange  for
  blood  lead  screening  of  any  child  who requires screening and whose
  parent or guardian is unable to obtain a lead test because the child  is
  uninsured or the child's insurance does not cover such screening.
    b.  The  department  shall  develop  a pamphlet explaining the hazards
  associated with lead-based paint and describing  the  procedures  to  be
  used  in  order  for  a violation of sections 27-2056.6 and 27-2056.7 of
  this code to  be  corrected.  The  pamphlet  shall  include  appropriate
  telephone  numbers  to  obtain  lead  poisoning screening, diagnosis and
  treatment  information  and  to  report  unsafe  lead-based  paint  work
  practices.  Such  pamphlet  shall  be  made available in accordance with
  section 27-2056.9 of  this  code.  Such  pamphlet  shall  also  be  made
  available to any member of the public upon request.
