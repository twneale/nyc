  therein named shall appear before the department, or any  person  taking
  or about to take such examination, at some time or times and place to be
  stated  in  the  affidavit, it shall be the duty of such judge, if he or
  she shall discover reasonable cause so to do, to issue his or her  order
  requiring  such  person  or  persons  named to appear and submit to such
  examination as, and to the extent such order may state, at the time  and
  place to be in the order named; and the order, signed by such judge, may

  the  facts  as  to  such  refusal being brought before any such judge by
  affidavit.
