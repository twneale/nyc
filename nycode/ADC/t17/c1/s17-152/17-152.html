<pre>
    
 
    &sect;   17-152  Validity  of  lien;  grounds  for  challenge.  a.  In  any
  proceedings to enforce or discharge the lien, the validity of  the  lien
  shall not be subject to challenge based on:
    (1) The lawfulness of the work done; or
    (2)  The  propriety  and accuracy of the items of expenses for which a
  lien is claimed, except as provided in this section.
    b. No such challenge may be made  except  by  (1)  the  owner  of  the
  property, or (2) a mortgagee or lienor whose mortgage or lien would, but
  for the provision of section 17-151, have priority over the department's
  lien.
    c.  With  respect  to  any  issue  specified  in subdivision a of this
  section the certificate of the  department  filed  pursuant  to  section
  17-153 shall be presumptive evidence of the facts stated therein.
