<pre>
    
 
    &sect;   17-133.1  Failure  to  abate  rodents;  penalties.  Every  person,
  corporation, or body that shall violate or not conform to any provisions
  of the health code of the city of New York or any applicable  law,  rule
  or  regulation pertaining to the eradication of rodents, the elimination
  of rodent harborages or other rodent related nuisances shall  be  liable
  to  pay  a  civil penalty of not less than three hundred dollars for the
  first violation. The penalty for each subsequent violation of  the  same
  provision of law, rule or regulation, at the same premises and under the
  same ownership or control, within a two-year period, shall be double the
  amount  of  the previous violation; provided, however, that such penalty
  shall not exceed the maximum allowable  penalty  set  forth  in  section
  17-133 of this code. Such penalties may be sued for and recovered by and
  in  the  name  of the department, with costs, before any judge, justice,
  administrative  law  judge  or  hearing  examiner  in  the  city  having
  jurisdiction   of   such   or   similar  actions.  The  judge,  justice,
  administrative law judge or hearing examiner who presided at a trial  or
  hearing  where  such  penalty  is  determined and assessed shall fix, in
  writing, the amount of the penalty to be  recovered,  and  shall  direct
  that such amount be included in the judgment or decision.
