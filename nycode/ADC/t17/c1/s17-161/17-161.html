<pre>
    
 
    &sect;   17-161  Institution  of  proceedings.  Such  proceeding  shall  be
  instituted through a petition addressed to such court containing a brief
  statement of the reasons therefor, and shall not be required to  contain
  further  allegations  of  facts  than  those  which  have  actuated  the
  department in this proceeding, which shall then be  carried  on  in  the
  manner  prescribed for a capital project proceeding by subchapter one of
  chapter three of title five of the code. The owner of such  building  or
  any  person  interested  therein  may  in  his or her answer dispute the
  necessity of the destruction of such building or part  thereof,  as  the
  case  may  be. In such case, the court shall not take steps to ascertain
  the value of the property unless proof is made of the necessity of  such
  destruction.
