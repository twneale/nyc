    &sect;  17-118 Putrid cargoes, et cetera, may be destroyed. The department,
  when it shall judge it necessary, may cause any cargo or  part  thereof,
  or  any matter or thing within the city, that may be putrid or otherwise
  dangerous to the  public  health,  to  be  destroyed  or  removed.  Such
  removal,  when  ordered,  shall be to such place as the department shall
  direct; such removal or destruction shall be made at the expense of  the
  owner  or owners of the property so removed or destroyed. Money expended
  for the same may be recovered from such owner or owners, in an action at
  law by the department.
