Section 17-163

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  17-163  Amount  of  compensation. If the court is satisfied by such
  evidence, then the compensation:
    1. Shall in the first case, so far as it is based on rental, be on the
  rental of the building, as distinct from the ground  rent,  which  would
  have  been  obtainable  if the building was occupied for legal purposes,
  and only  by  the  number  of  persons  whom  the  building,  under  all
  circumstances  of  the  case,  was  fitted  to  accommodate without such
  overcrowding as is dangerous or injurious to the health of the  inmates;
  and
    2.  Shall  in  the second case be the amount estimated as the value of
  the building if it had been put  into  a  sanitary  condition,  or  into
  reasonably good repair, after deducting the estimated expense of putting
  it into such condition or repair; and
    3.  Shall  in  the  third  case  be  the value of the materials of the
  building.
