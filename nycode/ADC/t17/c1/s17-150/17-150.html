    &sect;  17-150  Suits for expenses. The department, in case it has incurred
  any expense, or has rendered service for which payment is  due,  and  as
  the  rules  of  the department may provide, may institute and maintain a
  suit against any one liable for such expenses, or  against  any  person,
  firm,  or  corporation,  owing or who may owe such rent or compensation,
  and may recover the expenses so incurred under any such  order.  One  or
  more  of  such  parties liable or interested may be made parties to such
  action as the department may elect; but  the  parties  made  responsible
  herein  for  such  expenses  shall  be  liable  to contribute or to make
  payment as between themselves, in respect of such expenses, and  of  any
  sum recovered for such expenses or compensation, or by any party paid on
  account thereof, according to the legal or equitable obligation existing
  between them.
