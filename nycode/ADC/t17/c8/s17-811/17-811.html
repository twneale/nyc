Section 17-811

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  17-811  Animal  population  control  program.  The department shall
  promulgate rules and regulations to establish and  implement  an  animal
  population  control  program  within  one  hundred  eighty days from the
  effective date of this section. The purpose of this program shall be  to
  reduce  the  population of unwanted stray dogs and cats thereby reducing
  potential threats to public health and safety and reducing the costs  of
  caring  for  these  animals.  This  program shall seek to accomplish its
  purpose by encouraging residents of the city of New  York  who  are  the
  owners  of dogs and cats to have them spayed or neutered by providing no
  or  low-cost  spaying  and  neutering  services  to  such  owners.   The
  department shall promulgate rules and regulations necessary to establish
  an  animal  population  control  program  including, but not limited, to
  creating clinics or mobile units where such services shall be  performed
  and  establishing  criteria  for  pet  owner  eligibility  to  use  such
  services. Indicia of eligibility for pet owners seeking no  or  low-cost
  spay  and  neuter  services  shall  include  but  not  be limited to any
  criteria deemed acceptable by the agencies performing the services.  The
  commissioner  may  solicit  and  accept funds from the animal population
  control fund established pursuant to section 17-812 of this chapter  and
  any  other  public or private source to help carry out the provisions of
  this section.
