<pre>
    
 
    &sect;   17-810   Euthanizing   animals;   time   frame   for  making  such
  determination.  In determining when a full-service shelter may euthanize
  a lost, stray or homeless animal held by it, such shelter shall  exclude
  from  the  calculation  of  the  number  of  hours  that such shelter is
  required by law to hold such animal before euthanizing such animal those
  hours when such shelter is not required to accept dogs and cats pursuant
  to paragraph one of subdivision d of section  17-802  of  this  chapter.
  Such   calculation   of   the  number  of  hours  shall  not  take  into
  consideration the full-service shelter required to accept dogs and  cats
  twenty-four hours per day pursuant to subdivision a of section 17-803 of
  this chapter.
