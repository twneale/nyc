  an  employee  of  the  office  of  chief medical examiner to follow such

  office  of  chief medical examiner, or in any other appropriate instance

  analysis officer to be reviewed  by  the  executive  management  of  the

  cause  analysis officer that a significant event has occurred within the
  office of chief medical examiner, the office of chief  medical  examiner
  shall  report  the occurrence of such significant event to the mayor and
