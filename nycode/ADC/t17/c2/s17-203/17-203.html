Section 17-203

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  17-203  Autopsies; findings. If it may be concluded with reasonable
  certainty that death occurred from natural causes or  obvious  traumatic
  injury,  and  there  are  no  other  circumstances which would appear to
  require an autopsy, the chief medical  examiner,  deputy  chief  medical
  examiner  or  medical  examiner  or medical investigator in charge shall
  certify the cause of death and file a report of his or her  findings  in
  the  office  of chief medical examiner. If, however, in the opinion of a
  medical examiner, an autopsy is necessary, the same shall  be  performed
  by  a  medical  examiner.  Where  indicated,  the  autopsy shall include
  toxicologic, histologic, microbiologic  and  serologic  examinations.  A
  detailed  description  of the findings of all autopsies shall be written
  or dictated. The findings of the investigation at the  scene  of  death,
  the autopsy and any toxicologic, histologic, serologic and microbiologic
  examinations,  and the conclusions drawn therefrom shall be filed in the
  office of chief medical examiner. Such findings and conclusions shall be
  signed by the medical examiner performing the autopsy.
