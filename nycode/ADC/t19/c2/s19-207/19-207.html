Section 19-207

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  19-207 Judgments. a. The hearing officer shall make a determination
  on the charges, either sustaining or dismissing them. Where the  hearing
  officer  determines  that  the charges have been sustained he or she may
  examine the parking violations record of the  person  charged  prior  to
  rendering  a  judgment. Judgments sustaining or dismissing charges shall
  be entered on a judgment roll maintained by  the  bureau  together  with
  records  showing  payment  and non-payment of penalties. No penalties or
  fees for late payment of a sustained charge shall  be  assessed  by  the
  bureau  until  at  least thirty days have elapsed from the issuance of a
  notice of determination. If a person files an  appeal  pursuant  to  the
  rules  of  the  bureau,  no  penalties  or  fees  for  late payment of a
  sustained charge shall be assessed by the bureau until at  least  thirty
  days  have elapsed from the issuance of a notice of determination of the
  appeal.
    b. Where an operator or owner fails to enter a plea  to  a  charge  of
  parking  violation  or  fails  to appear on a designated hearing date or
  subsequent adjourned date, as prescribed by this chapter or by  rule  or
  regulation  of  the  bureau, such failure to plead or to appear shall be
  deemed, for all purposes, an admission of liability and shall be grounds
  for rendering and  entering  a  default  judgment.  However,  after  the
  expiration  of  the  time  prescribed  for  entering a plea or making an
  appearance, and before such default judgment may be rendered, the bureau
  shall notify such operator  or  owner,  by  ordinary  mail  (1)  of  the
  violation  charge, (2) of the impending default judgment, and (3) that a
  default may be avoided by entering a plea or making an appearance within
  thirty days of the sending of such notice. Pleas entered or  appearances
  made  within that period shall be in the manner prescribed in the notice
  and not subject to additional penalty or fee. Such notice  of  impending
  default  judgment shall not be required prior to the rendering and entry
  thereof in the case of operators or owners who are non-residents of  the
  state  of  New York. In no case shall a default judgment be rendered or,
  where required, a notice of impending default  judgment  be  sent,  more
  than  two years after the expiration of the time prescribed for entering
  a plea or making an appearance.
