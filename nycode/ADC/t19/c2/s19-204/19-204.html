Section 19-204

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 19-204 Notice of violation. a. The notice of violation shall contain
  information  advising  the  person charged of the manner and the time in
  which he or she may plead either guilty or  not  guilty  to  the  charge
  alleged  in  the  notice.  Such notice of violation shall also contain a
  warning to advise the person charged that failure to plead in the manner
  and time provided shall be deemed, for all  purposes,  an  admission  of
  liability  and  that  a  default  judgment may be rendered. The form and
  wording of the notice of violation shall be prescribed by the  director.
  A copy of each notice of violation served shall be filed and retained by
  the  bureau, and shall be deemed a record kept in the ordinary course of
  business, and shall be prima  facie  evidence  of  the  facts  contained
  therein.
    b.  The  notice  of  violation  shall  be  served  personally upon the
  operator of a motor vehicle who is present at the time of  service,  and
  his  or  her name, together with the license designation as shown by the
  registration plates on said vehicle,  shall  be  inserted  therein.  The
  notice  of violation shall be served upon the owner of the motor vehicle
  if the operator is not present, by affixing such notice to said  vehicle
  in  a  conspicuous place. Whenever such notice is so affixed, in lieu of
  inserting the name of the person charged with the violation in the space
  provided for the identification of said person, the words "owner of  the
  motor  vehicle  bearing  license"  may be inserted to be followed by the
  license designation as shown by the registration plates on said vehicle.
  Service of the notice of violation  by  affixation  as  herein  provided
  shall  have  the  same force and effect and shall be subject to the same
  penalties for disregard thereof as though the same was personally served
  with the name of the person charged with the violation inserted therein.
    c. For purposes of this section, an operator of a motor vehicle who is
  not the owner thereof but who uses or operates  such  vehicle  with  the
  permission  of  the owner, express or implied, shall be deemed to be the
  agent of such owner to receive notices of violation, whether  personally
  served on such operator or served by affixation in the manner aforesaid,
  and  service  made  in  either  manner  as herein provided shall also be
  deemed to be lawful service upon such owner.
