  within  the  bureau  which shall consist of three or more senior hearing
  examiners, as the director shall determine.
    b. An appeal from a judgment of any hearing officer shall be submitted
  to the appeals board, which shall have power to review the facts and the
  law, but shall not consider any evidence which was not presented to  the
  hearing  officer  and shall have power to reverse or modify any judgment
  appealed from for error of fact or law.
    c. A party aggrieved by the judgment of a hearing officer may obtain a
  review thereof by serving upon the bureau  within  thirty  days  of  the
  entry of such judgment, a notice of appeal setting forth the reasons why
  the judgment should be reversed or modified.
    d.  Appeals  shall  be  made  without  the appearance of the appellant
  unless requested by the appellant or the appeals board. Within ten  days
  after  a  request for an appearance, made by the appellant or the board,
  the  bureau  shall  advise  the  appellant,  either  personally  or   by
  registered  or  certified mail, return receipt requested, of the date on
  which he or she shall appear. The appellant shall be notified in writing
  of the decision of the appeals board.
    e. The service of a notice of appeal shall not stay the enforcement of
  a judgment appealed from unless the appellant shall have posted  a  bond
  in  the  amount of the judgment appealed from, at the time of, or before
  the service of such notice.
