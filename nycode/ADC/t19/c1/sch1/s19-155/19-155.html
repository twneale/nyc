    &sect;  19-155  Study of alternative roadway and sidewalk materials. a. The
  department and the department of environmental protection shall  conduct
  a  study  on  the  possible  use  of permeable materials on roadways and
  sidewalks under the jurisdiction of the  department.  Such  study  shall
  include  the  following:  (i)  various  types  of permeable material for
  roadway and sidewalk use; (ii) the expected costs of such materials  and
  the  projected  feasibility of such materials, including but not limited
  to durability, operational function and performance; (iii) the volume of
  stormwater anticipated to be  permeated  through  such  materials;  (iv)
  recommendations and limitations regarding the use of permeable materials
  on  roadways and sidewalks under the jurisdiction of the department; (v)
  the maintenance practices for such roadways and sidewalks and  estimated
  costs of such practices; (vi) the effect on utilities and other entities
  that  will  need  to  make  cuts  in  such roadways and sidewalks; (vii)
  methods to restore the porosity of such roadways and  sidewalks  and  an
  estimate  of the costs of such methods; (viii) recommendations regarding
  the use and limitations  of  permeable  materials  by  private  property
  owners  on  private  roadways,  parking  lots  and sidewalks; and (ix) a
  determination on whether a uniform standard  on  the  use  of  permeable
  materials in sidewalks within the city of New York is appropriate, based
  on  the results of the study and pilot required pursuant to subdivisions
  a  and  b  of  this  section.  If  such  uniform  standards  are  deemed
  appropriate,   the  department,  in  consultation  with  other  agencies
  including but not limited to the department of parks and recreation  and
  the  department  of  design and construction, shall make recommendations
  and exceptions to such uniform standard. Such study shall  be  completed
  and  delivered  to  the  speaker  of  the  council  and  posted  on  the
  department's website not more than thirty months following the effective
  date of the local law that added this section.
    b. The department shall undertake  a  pilot  program  on  the  use  of
  permeable  materials  on  roadway  and  sidewalk surfaces as part of the
  study required pursuant to subdivision a of  this  section.  Such  pilot
  program  shall  include  evaluation  of  permeable  materials  in  three
  different types of roadway  conditions  and  three  different  types  of
  sidewalk  conditions,  with such conditions including but not limited to
  roadway and pedestrian volume and locations susceptible to flooding. The
  department shall consult with the department of environmental protection
  prior to choosing the locations for such pilot program. A report on such
  pilot program shall be completed and delivered to  the  speaker  of  the
  council and posted on the department's website not more than one hundred
  twenty days following the completion of the pilot program.
