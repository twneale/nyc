Section 19-133.1

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  19-133.1  Unlawful  Sidewalk ATMs. a. For purposes of this section,
  "Automated Teller Machine Booth" ("ATM booth")  shall  mean  any  device
  linked to the accounts and records of a banking institution that enables
  consumers  to carry out banking transactions, including, but not limited
  to, account transfers, deposits, cash  withdrawals,  balance  inquiries,
  and loan payments.
    b.  Notwithstanding  any  other provision of law, it shall be unlawful
  for any property owner to permit an ATM  booth  to  be  located  on  any
  portion  of the sidewalk that is adjacent to the property of such owner,
  lies between the curb line and the building line, and  is  intended  for
  use by the public.
    c.  The  department  may serve an order upon the owner of any premises
  adjacent to which such ATM booth is located,  requiring  such  owner  to
  remove  such  ATM booth. The department shall provide in such order that
  such ATM booth shall be removed within thirty days of the date  of  such
  order.  Such  order  shall  be  served personally upon the owner of such
  premises, or by leaving it with a person in control of the premises,  or
  by leaving it or posting it at the place of business of the owner, or by
  leaving  it  or  posting it at any home of such owner, if service to the
  place of business of such owner is impractical.
    d. Failure to comply with an order  to  remove  an  ATM  booth  within
  thirty  days of the date of such order shall be a violation subject to a
  civil penalty of not less than two thousand  five  hundred  dollars  nor
  more than five thousand dollars for the first day of such violation. Any
  owner who remains in violation beyond the first day after the expiration
  of  the  thirty-day period specified in such order shall be subject to a
  civil penalty of five thousand dollars for every five-day period  during
  which  he  or  she  remains  in  violation.  There shall be a rebuttable
  presumption that the ATM booth has remained in place  during  each  such
  five-day period.
    e.  In  addition  to any other fines, penalties, sanctions or remedies
  provided for in this section, an ATM booth which remains in violation of
  subdivision d of this section shall be deemed abandoned. The  department
  shall  be authorized to provide for the seizure of such ATM booth, after
  the owner has been provided with notice and an opportunity to  be  heard
  before the appropriate administrative tribunal, if the owner of such ATM
  booth  has  accumulated  an aggregate of fifty thousand dollars in civil
  penalties that have  remained  unpaid  for  ninety  days  following  the
  expiration  of  the  time  to appeal the imposition of such penalties in
  accordance with the procedures of the environmental control board.
