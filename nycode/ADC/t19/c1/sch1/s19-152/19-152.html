Section 19-152

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  19-152  Duties  and  obligations  of property owner with respect to
  sidewalks and lots. a. The owner of any real property, at his or her own
  cost and expense, shall (1) install, construct, repave, reconstruct  and
  repair  the  sidewalk  flags  in  front  of  or  abutting such property,
  including but not  limited  to  the  intersection  quadrant  for  corner
  property,  and  (2) fence any vacant lot or lots, fill any sunken lot or
  lots and/or cut down any raised lots comprising  part  or  all  of  such
  property  whenever  the commissioner of the department shall so order or
  direct.  The  commissioner  shall  so  order  or  direct  the  owner  to
  reinstall, construct, reconstruct, repave or repair a defective sidewalk
  flag in front of or abutting such property, including but not limited to
  the intersection quadrant for corner property or fence any vacant lot or
  lots,  fill  any  sunken  lot  or  lots  and/or cut down any raised lots
  comprising part or all of such property after an inspection of such real
  property by a departmental inspector. The commissioner shall not  direct
  the  owner  to  reinstall, reconstruct, repave or repair a sidewalk flag
  which was damaged by the city, its agents or any contractor employed  by
  the  city  during the course of a city capital construction project. The
  commissioner shall direct the owner to  install,  reinstall,  construct,
  reconstruct,  repave or repair only those sidewalk flags which contain a
  substantial defect. For the purposes of this subdivision, a  substantial
  defect shall include any of the following:
    1.  where  one or more sidewalk flags is missing or where the sidewalk
  was never built;
    2. one or more sidewalk flag(s) are cracked to such an extent that one
  or more pieces of the flag(s) may be loosened or readily removed;
    3. an undermined sidewalk flag below which there is a visible void  or
  a loose sidewalk flag that rocks or seesaws;
    4.  a  trip  hazard,  where  the  vertical  grade differential between
  adjacent sidewalk flags is greater than or equal to  one  half  inch  or
  where  a  sidewalk flag contains one or more surface defects of one inch
  or greater in all horizontal directions and is one half inch or more  in
  depth;
    5.  improper  slope,  which  shall mean (i) a flag that does not drain
  toward the curb and retains water, (ii) flag(s) that must be replaced to
  provide  for  adequate  drainage  or  (iii)  a  cross  slope   exceeding
  established standards;
    6.   hardware   defects   which  shall  mean  (i)  hardware  or  other
  appurtenances not flush within 1/2" of  the  sidewalk  surface  or  (ii)
  cellar  doors that deflect greater than one inch when walked on, are not
  skid resistant or are otherwise in a dangerous or unsafe condition;
    7. a defect involving structural integrity, which shall  mean  a  flag
  that  has  a  common  joint,  which  is  not  an expansion joint, with a
  defective flag and has a crack that meets  such  common  joint  and  one
  other joint;
    8.  non-compliance  with DOT specifications for sidewalk construction;
  and
    9. patchwork which shall mean (i) less than full-depth repairs to  all
  or  part  of  the  surface area of broken, cracked or chipped flag(s) or
  (ii) flag(s) which are partially or wholly constructed with  asphalt  or
  other unapproved non-concrete material; except that, patchwork resulting
  from  the  installation  of canopy poles, meters, light poles, signs and
  bus stop shelters shall  not  be  subject  to  the  provisions  of  this
  subdivision unless the patchwork constitutes a substantial defect as set
  forth in paragraphs (1) through (8) of this subdivision.
    a-1.  An  owner  of  real  property shall bear the cost for repairing,
  repaving, installing, reinstalling, constructing or  reconstructing  any
  sidewalk flag in front of or abutting his or her property, including but

  not  limited to the intersection quadrant for corner property, deemed to
  have a substantial defect which is discovered in the course  of  a  city
  capital  construction  project  or  pursuant  to  the department's prior
  notification  program, wherein the department receives notification of a
  defective sidewalk flag(s) by any member of the general public or by  an
  employee of the department. However, with respect to substantial defects
  identified pursuant to the prior notification program, the sidewalk must
  be  deemed  to  be a hazard prior to the issuance of a violation for any
  substantial defect contained in subdivision a of this  section  for  any
  sidewalk  flag  on  such  sidewalk.  For purposes of this subdivision, a
  hazard shall exist on any sidewalk where there is any of the following:
    1. one or more sidewalk flags is missing or  the  sidewalk  was  never
  built;
    2.  one or more sidewalk flag(s) is cracked to such an extent that one
  or more pieces of the flag(s) may be loosened or readily removed;
    3. an undermined sidewalk flag below which there is a visible void;
    4. a loose sidewalk flag that rocks or seesaws;
    5. a vertical  grade  differential  between  adjacent  sidewalk  flags
  greater than or equal to one half inch or a sidewalk flag which contains
  one  or  more  surface  defects of one inch or greater in all horizontal
  directions and is one half inch or more in depth; or
    6. cellar doors that deflect greater than one inch when walked on, are
  not skid resistant or are otherwise in a dangerous or unsafe condition.
    b. All such work shall be done in accordance with such  specifications
  and regulations prescribed by the department.
    c. Whenever the department shall determine that a sidewalk flag should
  be  installed,  constructed, reconstructed, or repaved, or that a vacant
  lot should be fenced, or a sunken lot filled or a raised lot  cut  down,
  it may order the owner of the property abutting on such sidewalk flag or
  the  owner  of  such vacant, sunken or raised lot by issuing a violation
  order to  perform  such  work.  Such  order  shall  provide  a  detailed
  explanation  of  the  inspection  and  the sidewalk defects according to
  sidewalk flags including a detailed diagram of the property and  defects
  by  type.  The order shall also inform the owner of the existence of the
  borough offices within the department together with  an  explanation  of
  the  procedures  utilized  by  the  borough  office  as  provided for in
  paragraph eighteen of subdivision a of section twenty-nine hundred three
  of the New York city charter as well as a complaint and appeal  process,
  including  the  right  to  request  a reinspection and then the right to
  appeal by filing a notice of claim with the office of the comptroller of
  the city of New York and thereafter a petition for appeal and commence a
  proceeding to review and/or correct the notice  of  account  and/or  the
  quality  of  the  work  performed  under  the  direction  of  or  by the
  department as provided herein and the procedures as to how to appeal  by
  filing  a notice of claim with the office of the comptroller of the city
  of New York and how to file a petition  and  commence  a  proceeding  to
  review  and/or  correct  the notice of account and/or the quality of the
  work performed as provided herein and the location where the  forms  may
  be  obtained.  Such  order  shall  specify  the work to be performed, an
  estimate of the cost of the work to repair the  defects  and  the  order
  shall  also  specify a reasonable time for compliance, provided that the
  time  for  compliance  shall  be  a  minimum  of  forty-five  days.  The
  department shall, by appropriate regulations, provide for a reinspection
  by  a different departmental inspector than the inspector that conducted
  the first or original inspection upon request of the property  owner  to
  the  appropriate borough office. Where appropriate, the department shall
  notify the property owner of the date of reinspection at least five days
  prior  to  the  reinspection  date.  Such   inspector   conducting   the

  reinspection  shall  conduct  an  independent inspection of the property
  without access to the reports from the first inspection.  The  inspector
  conducting  the  reinspection shall file a new report and the department
  shall  issue  a  new  order  to  the owner specifying the results of the
  reinspection with a detailed diagram of  the  property  and  defects  by
  type.  Such order shall also advise the owner of the procedures utilized
  by  the  borough  office  as  provided  for  in  paragraph  eighteen  of
  subdivision  a of section twenty-nine hundred three of the New York city
  charter and also of the right to challenge the notice of account  and/or
  the  quality  of the work performed by filing a notice of claim with the
  office of the comptroller and  thereafter  a  petition  and  commence  a
  proceeding  to  review  and/or  correct the notice of account and/or the
  quality of  the  work  performed  under  the  direction  of  or  by  the
  department as provided in sections 19-152.2 and 19-152.3 of the code and
  specify  the  procedures as to how to appeal by filing a notice of claim
  with the office of the comptroller of the city of New York  and  how  to
  file  a  petition and commence a proceeding to review and/or correct the
  notice of account and/or the quality  of  the  work  performed  and  the
  location where the forms may be obtained.
    d.  If the department has been notified in writing of the existence of
  a defective, unsafe, dangerous or obstructed  condition  of  a  sidewalk
  pursuant  to  subdivision  (c)  of  section  7-201  of the code, and the
  department determines  that  such  condition  constitutes  an  immediate
  danger  to  the  public,  it  may  notify  the  property owner that such
  condition constitutes an immediate danger to the public and direct  such
  owner to repair same within ten days of the service of the notice.
    e. Upon the owner's failure to comply with such order or notice within
  forty-five  days  of  service  and filing thereof, or within ten days if
  such period is fixed by the department pursuant to subdivision d of this
  section, the department may  perform  the  work  or  cause  same  to  be
  performed  under  the  supervision of the department, the cost of which,
  together  with   administrative   expenses,   as   determined   by   the
  commissioner,   but  not  to  exceed  twenty  percent  of  the  cost  of
  performance, shall constitute a debt recoverable from the owner by  lien
  on the property affected or otherwise. Upon entry by the city collector,
  in  the  book  in  which  such  charges are to be entered, of the amount
  definitely computed as a statement of account by  the  department,  such
  debt  shall  become  a  lien  prior to all liens or encumbrances on such
  property, other than taxes. An owner shall be deemed  to  have  complied
  with  this subdivision if he or she obtains a permit from the department
  to perform such work as specified in the order within the time set forth
  therein and completes such work within ten days thereafter.
    f. Service of a notice or  order  by  the  department  upon  an  owner
  pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be made upon such owner
  or  upon his or her designated managing agent personally or by certified
  or registered mail, return receipt requested, addressed  to  the  person
  whose  name  appears  on  the records of the city collector as being the
  owner of the premises. If the records of the city collector show that  a
  party,  other  than  the owner, has been designated to receive tax bills
  for such property, the notice shall be mailed to such party as  well  as
  to the owner of record, at his or her last known address, or, if it is a
  multiple  dwelling, service upon the owner or managing agent may be made
  in accordance with section 27-2095 of the code. If  the  postal  service
  returns  the  order  with  a  notation  that the owner refused to accept
  delivery of such notice, it may be served by ordinary mail and posted in
  a conspicuous place on the premises.

    g. A copy of such notice or order shall also be filed in the office of
  the clerk of each county where the property is situated,  together  with
  proof of service thereof.
    h.  Nothing  contained  in  this  section shall impair or diminish the
  power of the city to install, construct, reconstruct, repave  or  repair
  sidewalk  flags or to fence vacant lots or to fill sunken lots or to cut
  down raised lots or to enter into contracts with the owners of  premises
  abutting on streets for such installation, construction, reconstruction,
  repaving  or  repair  of  sidewalk  flags  or  fencing of vacant lots or
  filling of  sunken  lots,  or  cutting  down  of  any  raised  lots,  in
  accordance  with  the  rules  of the procurement policy board. Nor shall
  anything contained in this section affect or  impair  any  act  done  or
  right  accrued  or accruing, or acquired, or liability incurred prior to
  the effective date of this section, but  the  same  may  be  enjoyed  or
  asserted as fully and to the same extent as if this section had not been
  enacted.
    i.  After  the  work  has  been  performed  or after inspection by the
  department in the case where the work was performed under the  direction
  of  the  department a notice of such account, stating the amount due and
  the nature of the charge, shall be mailed by the city collector,  within
  five  days  after  such  entry,  to the last known address of the person
  whose name appears on the records of the city  collector  as  being  the
  owner  or  agent or as the person designated by the owner to receive tax
  bills or, where no name appears, to the premises,  addressed  to  either
  the  owner  or the agent. Such notice shall also inform the addressee of
  the existence of a complaint and appeal process including the procedures
  utilized by the borough office as provided for in paragraph eighteen  of
  subdivision  a of section twenty-nine hundred three of the New York city
  charter the right to appeal the amount  due  and  the  quality  of  work
  performed under the direction of or by the department by filing a notice
  of  a  claim  with the office of the comptroller of the city of New York
  and thereafter by filing a petition and commence a proceeding to  review
  and/or correct the notice of such account and/or the quality of the work
  performed  under  direction  of  or  by  the  department  as provided in
  sections 19-152.2 and 19-152.3 of the code and the  location  where  the
  forms  may be obtained. The owner shall only be responsible for the cost
  of reinstalling, constructing,  reconstructing,  repaving  or  repairing
  defective  sidewalk  flags ordered or directed by the department, not an
  entire sidewalk if the entire sidewalk lacks defects.
    j. If such charge is not paid within ninety  days  from  the  date  of
  entry,  it shall be the duty of the city collector to charge and receive
  interest thereon, to be calculated to the date of payment from the  date
  of entry.
    (1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (2) of this subdivision,
  interest  shall  be  charged  at the rate of interest applicable to such
  property for real property taxes pursuant to section 11-224 of the code.
    (2) With respect to any parcel on which the annual  tax  is  not  more
  than two thousand seven hundred fifty dollars, other than a parcel which
  consists  of vacant or unimproved land, interest shall be charged at the
  rate determined pursuant to subdivision p or at the rate  of  eight  and
  one-half percent whichever is lower.
    k.  Such  charge  and interest shall be collected and the lien thereof
  may be foreclosed in the manner provided by law for the  collection  and
  foreclosure  of  the  lien  of  taxes, sewer rents, sewer surcharges and
  water charges due and payable to the city, and the provisions of chapter
  four of title eleven of the code shall apply  to  such  charge  and  the
  interest thereon and the lien thereof.

    l.  In addition to collecting the charge for the cost of installation,
  construction, repaving, reconstruction and repair of a sidewalk, fencing
  of a vacant lot, filling of a sunken lot and/or cutting down any  raised
  lot as a lien, the city may maintain a civil action for recovery of such
  charge  against  a  property owner who is responsible under this section
  for such work in the first instance,  provided,  however,  that  in  the
  event  that the department performs the work without duly notifying such
  person in the manner prescribed in subdivision f, the cost to  the  city
  of  performing such work shall be prima facie evidence of the reasonable
  cost thereof.
    m. Upon application in writing of either (i) an owner of real property
  which is improved by a one, two, three, four, five or six family  house:
  or  (ii) an owner of real property which has an assessed valuation of no
  more than thirty thousand dollars, upon which a charge in excess of  two
  hundred  fifty  dollars  but  not in excess of five thousand dollars has
  been entered pursuant to this section, the commissioner of  finance  may
  agree with the owner to divide the charge into four annual installments.
  Each  installment  shall  be  as  nearly  equal  as  may  be.  The first
  installment thereof shall be  due  and  payable  upon  approval  of  the
  application  and each succeeding installment shall be due and payable on
  the next ensuing anniversary date of the date of entry  of  the  charge,
  together  with  interest  thereon  from  the  date  of entry at the rate
  determined pursuant to subdivision p,  or  at  the  rate  of  eight  and
  one-half  percent  per  annum,  whichever is lower. The commissioner may
  require  owners  of  parcels  making  application   pursuant   to   this
  subdivision  to  furnish satisfactory proof of their eligibility. In the
  event that the owner fails to make payment  of  any  installment  within
  thirty  days  of  the  due  date,  the  commissioner  may  declare  such
  installment agreement to be null and void and the balance of the  charge
  shall  become  immediately  due  and  payable  with interest at the rate
  prescribed in subdivision j of this section to be  calculated  from  the
  date  of entry to the date of payment. The installments not yet due with
  interest to date of payment may be paid at any time. The  city  may  not
  enforce  a lien against any owner who has entered into an agreement with
  the commissioner of finance pursuant to this section provided that he or
  she is not in default thereunder. No installment  shall  be  a  lien  or
  deemed  an  encumbrance upon the title to real property charged until it
  becomes due as herein  provided.  In  the  event  that  the  city  shall
  acquire,   by   condemnation  or  otherwise,  any  property  upon  which
  installments are not due, such installments shall become due as  of  the
  date  of  acquisition  of title by the city and shall be set off against
  any award that may be made for the property acquired, with  interest  to
  the date of acquisition of title.
    n. All orders or notices served by the commissioner in connection with
  the  installation, construction, reconstruction, repavement or repair of
  sidewalks, fencing of vacant lots, filling of  sunken  lots  or  cutting
  down  of  raised  lots and all charges arising out of the performance of
  such work by  the  department  subsequent  to  January  first,  nineteen
  hundred  seventy-seven  are  hereby  legalized,  validated, ratified and
  confirmed as though such orders, notices and charges were made  pursuant
  to this section.
    p.  On  or  before the first day of June, nineteen hundred eighty-six,
  and on or before the first day of June  of  each  succeeding  year,  the
  director  of  the  office  of  management and budget shall determine and
  certify the city's cost of debt service, expressed as a  percentage  and
  rounded  to  the  nearest  one-tenth  of  a  percentage  point and shall
  transmit copies of such  certification  to  the  city  council  and  the
  commissioner  of  finance.    The percentage so determined and certified

  shall be the rate of interest applicable for purposes of  paragraph  (2)
  of subdivision j and subdivision m during the ensuing fiscal year of the
  city,  provided,  however,  that  for  the  period beginning on February
  third,  nineteen  hundred  eighty-five  and  ending  on  June thirtieth,
  nineteen hundred eighty-six, the applicable rate of  interest  shall  be
  eight  and  one-half  percent per annum. Any rate determined pursuant to
  this subdivision shall apply to charges, or any portion  thereof,  which
  remain  or  become  due  on or after the date on which such rate becomes
  effective and shall apply only with  respect  to  interest  computed  or
  computable for periods or portions of periods occurring in the period in
  which  such rate is in effect. For the purposes of this subdivision, the
  city's cost of debt service shall be the average rate of  interest  paid
  by  the city during the first ten months of the fiscal year in which the
  determination is made on general obligation bonds  issued  by  the  city
  during  such  period  with  a  maturity  of  four years or if no general
  obligation bonds with a maturity of four years are  issued  during  such
  period,  on  general  obligation  bonds  with a maturity of no less than
  three nor more than five years.
    q. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision  of  this  section,  the
  amount  charged an owner for sidewalk reconstruction performed or caused
  to be performed by the department in  connection  with  a  city  capital
  construction  project  for  street  or  sewer  reconstruction  shall  be
  determined according to the average city expenditure for  such  sidewalk
  reconstruction  projects  in  the  borough  where such reconstruction is
  performed.  Such  average  expenditure  shall   be   computed   by   the
  commissioner.
    r.  The  department  shall keep record of all complaints submitted and
  work ordered and performed under this section and shall issue  a  public
  report  for  a  minimum  of  three  years  containing  such  information
  including  the  number  of  complaints  heard  each  year  according  to
  category,  the number of reinspections performed and the dispositions of
  such reinspections.
    s. The provisions of sections 19-149,  19-150  and  19-151  shall  not
  apply to orders issued pursuant to this section.
