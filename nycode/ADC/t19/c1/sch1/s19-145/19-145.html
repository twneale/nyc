    &sect;  19-145  Pavements  improperly  relaid. a. If any pavement which has
  been  removed  shall  not  be  relaid  to  the   satisfaction   of   the
  commissioner,  he or she may cause an order to be served upon the person
  by whom such pavement was removed,  or  if  such  removal  was  for  the
  purpose  of  making  a  connection  between any house or lot, or for any
  sewer or pipes in the street, or for constructing vaults,  or  otherwise
  improving  any house or lot, upon the owner or occupant of such house or
  lot, requiring such person, or the owner or occupant of  such  house  or
  lot,  to  have  such  pavement  properly  relaid  within five days after
  service of such order.
    Such order may be served upon the owner or occupant of a house or  lot
  by  leaving  the same with any person of adult age upon the premises, or
  posting the same thereupon.
    b. The cost of repaving such pavement shall be collected as follows:
    1. The commissioner shall certify to the comptroller the cost of  such
  work  with  a  description  of the lot or premises to improve which such
  removal was made.
    2. The comptroller shall certify the cost of such  work  to  the  city
  collector,  who  shall  collect the same in the same manner that arrears
  and water rates are collected.
