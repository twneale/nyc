  width and upward shall have sidewalks on each side thereof.
    b.  The  materials and construction of streets, including the width of
  the sidewalks thereon, shall fully conform to department  specifications
  for  such work, all of which shall be prescribed by the commissioner and

    c. Department specifications for streets shall include  a  requirement
  that  asphaltic  concrete,  other  than  I-4  mix  or  other  heavy duty
  asphaltic concrete mix approved by the commissioner, shall  contain  not
  less  than  thirty  percent  reclaimed  asphalt pavement, as measured by
  weight, and I-4 mix or other approved heavy duty asphaltic concrete  mix
  shall  contain  not less than ten percent reclaimed asphalt pavement, as
  measured by weight. In setting forth such specifications, the department
  shall make best efforts to  encourage  the  greatest  use  of  reclaimed
  asphalt pavement possible. This subdivision shall not apply to asphaltic

  governed by a federal or  state  law,  rule,  regulation,  guideline  or
  specification  that  requires  a different composition. The commissioner
  may waive compliance with this subdivision if  the  commissioner,  after
  consulting  with the commissioner of buildings and the owners or persons
  in charge of all asphalt plants located within the city,  finds  that  a
  sufficient supply of reclaimed asphalt pavement is not available.
