Section 19-103

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  19-103 Permits. a. In addition to any of the requirements specified
  in this subchapter and except as hereinafter specifically provided,  all
  permits  issued by the commissioner pursuant to this subchapter shall be
  subject to the provisions of this  section  and  any  rules  promulgated
  pursuant thereto. All applications for permits shall be submitted to the
  commissioner  in  such  form  and  shall contain such information as the
  commissioner shall prescribe.
    b. Each permit shall be subject to such reasonable conditions  as  the
  commissioner may determine are necessary to protect public safety and to
  safeguard the interests of the city.
    c. The commissioner may require that an applicant for a permit deposit
  cash  and/or a bond or other form of security with the city in an amount
  which the commissioner determines may be necessary to cover and pay  all
  of the expenses, costs and liability that the city may incur as a result
  of  the  activity for which the permit is to be issued, to insure prompt
  compliance with the terms and conditions of the permit or  to  otherwise
  safeguard the interests of the city.
    d.  The  commissioner  may  suspend  review of application for permits
  pending  (i)  payment  by  an  applicant  of  outstanding  fines,  civil
  penalties  or  judgments  imposed or entered against such applicant by a
  court or the environmental control board pursuant  to  this  subchapter,
  (ii)  payment  by  an  applicant  of  outstanding  fees or other charges
  lawfully assessed by the commissioner against such applicant pursuant to
  this subchapter and/or (iii) satisfactory  compliance  by  an  applicant
  with a request for corrective action or order issued by the commissioner
  pursuant to this subchapter.
    e.  1.  The commissioner may, after giving the permittee notice and an
  opportunity to be heard, revoke or refuse to renew a permit:
    (a) for failure to comply with the terms or conditions of such  permit
  or the provisions of this subchapter or of section 24-521 of the code or
  the  rules  or orders of the department in carrying out the activity for
  which the permit was issued;
    (b)  whenever  there   has   been   any   false   statement   or   any
  misrepresentation   as   to  a  material  fact  in  the  application  or
  accompanying papers upon which the issuance of the permit was based; or
    (c) whenever a permit has been issued in error and the conditions  are
  such that the permit should not have been issued.
    2.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing  provision,  if  the  commissioner
  determines that an imminent  peril  to  life  or  property  exists,  the
  commissioner  may  revoke  a  permit  without affording the permittee an
  opportunity to be heard prior to such revocation.  The  permittee  shall
  have  an  opportunity  to  be heard, in accordance with the rules of the
  department, within five days after such revocation.
    f. The commissioner may refuse to issue a permit to an  applicant  (i)
  who  has  exhibited  a  pattern  of disregard for the provisions of this
  subchapter, of section 24-521 of the code, the rules or  orders  of  the
  department  in  relation  thereto  or the terms or conditions of permits
  issued pursuant to such provisions, or (ii) who has been found liable by
  a court or in a proceeding before the environmental control board for  a
  violation  of any provision of this subchapter, of section 24-521 of the
  code, of a rule or order of the department in relation thereto or  of  a
  term  or  condition of a permit issued pursuant to such provision, which
  violation caused an imminent peril to life or property.
    g. The commissioner, consistent with  article  twenty-three-A  of  the
  correction  law,  may  refuse  to issue a permit if the applicant or any
  officer, principal, director or stockholder  of  such  applicant  owning
  more  than  ten  percent of the outstanding stock of the corporation has
  been convicted of a crime which in the judgment of the commissioner  has

  a  direct relationship to fitness or ability to perform the activity for
  which the permit is required.
    h.  1.  If  the  commissioner  finds that a permittee or any employee,
  agent, independent contractor or other person engaged in  performing  an
  activity  for  which  a permit has been issued has violated the terms or
  conditions of such permit or any provision  of  this  subchapter  or  of
  section 24-521 of the code relating to the activity for which the permit
  has  been  issued  or  any  order  issued  by or rule promulgated by the
  commissioner pursuant thereto or that a condition exists in  any  street
  which  is  in  violation of a provision of this subchapter or of section
  24-521 of the code or any order issued by or  rule  promulgated  by  the
  commissioner  pursuant  thereto,  unless  the  condition  is an imminent
  threat to life or safety, the commissioner may (i) notify the  permittee
  or  other  responsible person of the condition found by the commissioner
  to constitute such violation and request that action be taken to correct
  the condition in such a manner and within such period of time  as  shall
  be  set  forth  in such request, and (ii) afford such permittee or other
  responsible person an opportunity to contest the commissioner's  finding
  in  a  manner  to  be  set  forth  in  the  rules of the department. The
  commissioner may assess a fee for the  administrative  expense  and  the
  expense  of  additional  inspections which the department may incur as a
  result of such condition.
    2. The provisions of this subdivision shall not be construed to  limit
  the  power  of  the  commissioner  to  take  any other action authorized
  pursuant to this subchapter with respect to any violation, including but
  not limited to, the commencement of an action or proceeding in  a  court
  or  before  the  environmental  control  board  or  to  require that the
  commissioner resort to the procedure set forth in this subdivision as  a
  prerequisite  to  the commencement of an action or proceeding in a court
  or before the environmental control board or the  taking  of  any  other
  action  authorized  pursuant  to  this  subchapter  with  respect  to  a
  violation.
    i. As used in this section, the term "permit" includes a license.
