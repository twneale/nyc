Section 19-139

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  19-139  Excavations  for private purposes. Notice to public service
  corporations. The person by whom or for whose benefit any excavation  is
  to  be  made  in any street shall give notice thereof in writing, to any
  corporation whose pipes, mains or conduits are laid in the street  about
  to  be  disturbed  by such excavation, at least forty-eight hours before
  commencing the same; and shall, at his or her expense,  sustain,  secure
  and  protect  such pipes, mains or conduits from injury, and replace and
  pack the earth wherever the same shall have been  removed,  loosened  or
  disturbed,  under  or  around  them,  so  that  they  shall  be well and
  substantially supported. If any  such  person  shall  fail  to  sustain,
  secure  and  protect  such  pipes,  mains or conduits from injury, or to
  replace and pack the earth under or around them, as  the  provisions  of
  this  section  require,  then the same may be done by the corporation to
  whom the same  may  belong,  and  the  cost  thereof,  and  all  damages
  sustained by such corporation thereby shall be paid by such person, and,
  in  default thereof, such corporation may maintain an action against him
  therefor.
