<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 19-137 Land contour work. a. As used in this section.
    1.  The  term  "land  contour work" means clearing, grubbing, grading,
  filling or excavating vacant lots and other  land  areas  but  does  not
  include minor work which does not change surface drainage patterns.
    2. The term "clearing" means removing surface encumbrances from a land
  area,  including  but not limited to fences, trees, logs, stumps, brush,
  stones, vegetation and earth.
    3. The term "grubbing" means the removal of root systems  incident  to
  surface growths of trees and vegetation.
    4.  The  term  "grading" means leveling, sloping, raising, lowering or
  otherwise changing the existing surface of land area.
    5. The term "excavation" means removal of material, regardless of  its
  nature, from below the existing ground surface.
    6. The term "filling" means the deposition, levelling or compacting of
  organic  or  inorganic material at or in a vacant lot or land area for a
  purpose relating to the composition, contour, use, or  proposed  use  of
  the  land  or  for  the  purpose  of  disposing of material removed from
  another lot or land area.
    b. It shall be unlawful for any person to perform or  cause,  procure,
  suffer  or  permit  to  be  performed  any  land contour work, except as
  provided in subdivision c hereof, without  a  written  permit  from  the
  commissioner.
    c.  Subdivision  b  hereof  shall  not  apply: 1. To land contour work
  performed in connection with or in the course of the erection of one  or
  more  buildings  or  other  structures  or  in connection with land uses
  pursuant to a permit therefor issued by  the  department  of  buildings,
  provided however that, (a) such permit specifically authorizes such land
  contour  work,  and  (b)  such  land  contour work is performed entirely
  within the lot lines of the building  site  for  which  such  permit  is
  issued. In such cases where water courses, drainage ditches, conduits or
  other  means  of  carrying off water exist on the property and are to be
  altered or relocated, the commissioner of buildings shall  consult  with
  the  commissioner  of  environmental  protection concerning the means of
  disposal of surface water prior to issuance of a permit.
    2. to land contour work which consists only of making improvements  to
  a  land area on which a one or two-family house already exists and which
  does not result in any change in the surface runoff pattern of such land
  area.
    d. No condition shall be created or maintained as the result  of  land
  contour  work  that  will  interfere  with  existing  drainage  unless a
  substitute  therefor  is  provided  which   is   satisfactory   to   the
  commissioner   and  the  commissioner  of  environmental  protection  in
  accordance  with  criteria  established   by   such   commissioners   in
  consultation   with   the  department  of  health  and  mental  hygiene.
  Watercourses, drainage ditches, conduits and other like or unlike  means
  of  carrying  off  water  or  disposing  of  surface  water shall not be
  obstructed by refuse, waste, building  materials,  earth,  stones,  tree
  stumps,  branches  or by any other means that may interfere with surface
  drainage or cause the impoundment of surface  waters  either  within  or
  without  the  area  on  which contour work is performed. All excavations
  shall be drained and the drainage maintained as long as  the  excavation
  continues  or  remains.  Where  necessary,  pumping  shall be used. Fill
  material shall consist of inert, inorganic matter. It shall be  unlawful
  to  deposit  garbage,  waste  paper, lumber or other organic material in
  land fill. The provisions of this section shall not prevent placement of
  organic matter for fill by the department  of  sanitation  in  locations
  under  the  jurisdiction of such department. The commissioner shall have
  the power, in consultation with the commissioner of buildings  to  adopt

  rules  concerning the type of material that may be used for fill on land
  not mapped as park land. The commissioner shall enforce compliance  with
  the  provisions  hereof,  and  shall  make  immediate  complaint  to the
  corporation   counsel   of  any  violation  thereof.  In  addition,  the
  commissioner of buildings shall similarly enforce  compliance  with  the
  provisions  hereof  with  respect  to  any  land  contour work performed
  pursuant to a permit issued by the commissioner  of  buildings,  and  in
  addition  thereto  shall  inform the department of any failure to comply
  with  a  department  of  buildings  violation  order  relating  to   the
  provisions hereof.
    e.  1.  Whenever  the  department shall determine that a condition has
  been created, or has resulted by  reason  of  land  contour  work  which
  violates  any  provision  of  subdivision (d) hereof, the department may
  serve an order in  the  manner  prescribed  in  paragraph  two  of  this
  subdivision  upon  the  owners of the land upon which such condition has
  been created or has occurred, to correct such condition within the  time
  designated  in  such  order. Upon the owner's failure to comply with any
  order of the department as and within the time specified therein by such
  department, such department may perform such work or cause the  same  to
  be  performed,  the  cost  of  which  shall be due and payable and shall
  constitute a lien upon the land to which such order pertains,  when  the
  amount  thereof  shall have been finally computed by such department and
  an entry of the amount thereof shall have been entered in the office  of
  the  city  collector  in  the  book  in  which  such charges against the
  premises are to be entered. A notice thereof, stating the amount due and
  the nature of the charge shall be mailed by the city  collector,  within
  five  days  after  such  entry,  to the last known address of the person
  whose name appears on the records in the office of the city collector as
  being the owner or agent or as the person designated  by  the  owner  to
  receive  tax  bills, or where no name appears, to the premises addressed
  to either the owner or agent. If such charge is not paid  within  ninety
  days  from the date of entry, it shall be the duty of the city collector
  to collect and receive interest  thereon  at  the  rate  that  would  be
  applicable to a delinquent tax on such property, to be calculated to the
  date  of  payment  from  the date of entry. Such charge and the interest
  thereon shall continue to be, until paid, a  lien  on  the  premises  on
  which  such  work  was  performed.    Such  charge and interest shall be
  collected and the lien thereon may be foreclosed in the manner  provided
  by  law  for  the collection and foreclosure of the lien of taxes, sewer
  rents, sewer surcharges and water rents due and payable to the city, and
  the provisions of law applicable to the collection  and  foreclosure  of
  the  lien  of  such taxes, sewer rents, surcharges and water rents shall
  apply to such charge.
    The provisions of section 11-307 of the code applicable to the payment
  of assessments shall also  apply  to  charges  heretofore  or  hereafter
  established pursuant to this section.
    2.  Service  of  an  order upon an owner pursuant to the provisions of
  this section shall be made personally upon such owner  or  by  certified
  mail  addressed  to  the  last  known  address  of the person whose name
  appears upon the records in the office of the city  collector  as  being
  the owner of the premises or as the agent of such owner or as the person
  designated  by  the  owner  to receive the tax bills or, if no such name
  appears, to the address set forth as the address of  the  owner  in  the
  last  recorded  deed with respect to such premises. A copy of such order
  shall also be filed in the clerk's  office  of  each  county  where  the
  property  is  situated and shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the
  premises.
