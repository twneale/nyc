  thereto, or who causes, authorizes or permits such  violation  shall  be
  liable  for  a  civil  penalty  for  each  violation.  In  the case of a

  accordance  with subdivision c of section 19-133.1 shall be subject to a
  civil penalty of not less than two thousand  five  hundred  dollars  nor
  greater  than  five thousand dollars for the first day of such violation
  and a civil penalty of five thousand dollars for every five days  beyond
  the  first  day  that  such  violation  shall be in effect, and provided
  further that there shall be rebuttable presumption that  the  ATM  booth
  has remained in place during each such five-day period.
