<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  19-125 Posts and poles. a. General provisions. It shall be unlawful
  for any person to erect any post or pole in any street  unless  under  a
  permit or revocable consent of the commissioner.
    b.  Flagpole sockets. It shall be permissible, by and with a permit of
  the commissioner and with the  permission  of  the  owners  of  abutting
  property,  for  any  organization  of  military,  naval  and  marine war
  veterans to place in sidewalks near  the  curb,  at  suitable  distances
  apart,  sockets to be used only for the placing therein of stanchions or
  poles on which to  display  American  flags  to  be  used  on  patriotic
  occasions, public celebrations, or in connection with public parades.
    c.  Barber poles. The commissioner may grant permits for the placement
  of barber poles, not exceeding eight feet in height above  the  sidewalk
  level,  and other emblematic signs within the stoop-lines or fastened to
  the railing of any stoop, by or with the consent of the occupant of  the
  ground  floor  thereof,  but not beyond five feet from the house line or
  wall of any building where the stoop-line  extends  further,  except  on
  streets where the stoop-lines have been abolished.
    d.  Ornamental  lamp-posts.  It  shall  be  permissible  by and with a
  revocable consent granted by the commissioner and with the permission of
  the  owner  of  the  abutting  property  to  install  ornamental  posts,
  surmounted  by  lamps,  on  sidewalks, near the curb in front of hotels,
  places of worship, theatres,  railroad  stations,  places  of  business,
  apartment  houses  and  places  of public assemblage. No such post shall
  exceed in dimensions at the base more than eighteen inches in  diameter,
  if  circular  in  form, or, if upon a square base, no side thereof shall
  exceed eighteen inches. Each bulb installed and maintained  on  each  of
  the  lamp-posts  to be erected shall be lighted and remain lighted every
  night, during the hours in which public street  lamps  are  illuminated.
  The  installation  and maintenance of such poles and lamps and the power
  supplied shall be at the expense of the person to whom  the  consent  is
  granted.
    e.  Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, any business
  subject to the provisions of subdivision a  of  this  section,  and  any
  organization  of  military, naval and marine war veterans subject to the
  provisions of subdivision b of this section which displays the  flag  of
  the  United  States  on  its  property or on patriotic occasions, public
  celebrations, or in connection with public parades shall be required  to
  obtain  a permit or revocable consent for the erection of a post or pole
  for such display but shall be exempt from any fee  normally  charged  by
  the  department  for  the maintenance or erection of a post, flagpole or
  flagpole socket for that purpose.
