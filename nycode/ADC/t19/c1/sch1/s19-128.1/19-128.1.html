  the following terms shall have the following meanings:
    1. "Newsrack"  shall  mean  any  self-service  or  coin-operated  box,

  lines or the lateral lines of a roadway and the adjacent property lines,
  but not including the curb, intended for the use of pedestrians.
    4.  "Crosswalk"  shall  mean that part of a roadway, whether marked or
  unmarked, which is included within the extension of the  sidewalk  lines
  between opposite sides of the roadway at an intersection.
    5.  "Crosswalk  area"  shall mean that area of the sidewalk bounded by
  the extension of the lines of a crosswalk onto the sidewalk  up  to  the

  extension of the building lines to the curb on each corner.
    7.  "Board"  shall mean the environmental control board of the city of
  New York.
    8. "Close proximity"  shall  mean  a  distance  adjacent  to  an  area
  designed  to  facilitate  safe  ingress  or  egress that will reasonably
  permit and protect such safe ingress or egress.
    b. Requirements. It shall be a violation  for  any  person  to  place,
  install  or  maintain a newsrack on any sidewalk unless such newsrack is
  in compliance with the provisions of this section.
    1. The maximum height of any newsrack containing a single  publication
  shall  be  fifty inches. The maximum width of any such newsrack shall be
  twenty-four inches. The maximum depth of  any  such  newsrack  shall  be
  twenty-four inches.
    2.  No newsrack shall be used for advertising or promotional purposes,
  other than announcing the name and/or website of the newspaper or  other
  written matter offered for distribution in such newsrack.
    3. Each newsrack used to sell newspapers or other written matter shall
  be  equipped with a coin return mechanism in good working order so as to
  permit a person to secure a  refund  in  the  event  that  the  newsrack
  malfunctions.
    4.  The owner or person in control of each newsrack shall affix his or
  her name, address, telephone number, and email address, if any,  on  the
  newsrack   in   a  readily  visible  location  and  shall  conform  such
  information to any changes required to be reported to the department  in
  accordance  with  the provisions of subdivision c of this section. In no
  event shall a post office box be considered an  acceptable  address  for
  purposes of this paragraph.
    5.  Subject  to  the  limitations set forth in this section, newsracks
  shall be placed near a curb.
    6. A newsrack shall not be placed, installed or maintained: (a) within
  fifteen feet of any fire hydrant; (b) in any driveway  or  within  close
  proximity  of  any  driveway; (c) in any curb cut designed to facilitate
  street access by disabled persons or within two feet of  any  such  curb
  cut;  (d)  within close proximity of the entrance or exit of any railway
  station or subway station;  (e)  within  any  bus  stop;  (f)  within  a
  crosswalk  area;  (g)  within  a  corner area or within five feet of any
  corner area; (h) on any surface where such installation  or  maintenance
  will  cause damage to or will interfere with the use of any pipes, vault
  areas, telephone or electrical cables or other similar locations; (i) on
  any cellar door, grating, utility maintenance  cover  or  other  similar

  locations;  (j)  on,  in  or  over any part of the roadway of any public
  street; (k) unless  eight  feet  of  sidewalk  width  is  preserved  for
  unobstructed  pedestrian  passage;  (l)  in  any park or on any sidewalk
  immediately contiguous to a park where such sidewalk is an integral part
  of  the  park  design, such as the sidewalks surrounding Central Park or
  Prospect Park; (m) on any area of lawn, flowers, shrubs, trees or  other
  landscaping  or  in  such  a manner that use of the newsrack would cause
  damage to such landscaping; or (n) where such placement, installation or
  maintenance endangers the safety of persons or property. Any  limitation
  on the placement or installation of newsracks pursuant to this paragraph
  shall  be  no  more  restrictive  than  necessary to ensure the safe and
  unobstructed flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, and otherwise  to
  assure the safety of persons and property.
    7.  Every  newsrack shall be placed or installed in a manner that will
  ensure that such newsrack cannot be tipped over.
    c. Notification to city of location of  newsrack.    1.  (a)  Where  a
  newsrack has been placed or installed on a sidewalk before the effective
  date  of  this  section, the owner or person in control of such newsrack
  shall, within sixty days  after  such  effective  date,  submit  to  the
  commissioner  a form identifying: (i) the address of such newsrack; (ii)
  the name of the  newspaper(s)  or  written  matter  to  be  offered  for
  distribution  in  such  newsrack; and (iii) the name, address, telephone
  number, and email address of the owner or  person  in  control  of  such
  newsracks;   and  representing  that  such  newsracks  comply  with  the
  provisions of this section.
    (b) Any other owner or person in control of a newsrack shall, prior to
  placing or installing  such  newsrack  on  a  sidewalk,  submit  to  the
  commissioner  a form providing the information in clauses (ii) and (iii)
  of subparagraph (a) of this paragraph.
    2. Subsequent to the initial notification requirements  set  forth  in
  paragraph one of this subdivision, the owner or person in control of any
  newsrack  shall  submit  the  information set forth in subparagraph a of
  such paragraph once a year to the  commissioner  in  accordance  with  a
  notification schedule to be established by the commissioner. However, if
  the  number  of  newsracks  owned  or controlled by such owner or person
  increases or decreases by ten percent or more of the number of newsracks
  that have been included in the most recent notification required  to  be
  submitted  by  such  owner or person, such owner or person shall also be
  required to submit the information set forth in  such  paragraph  within
  seven  days  of  such  change, and provided, further, that such owner or
  person shall advise the department of any change in his or her  name  or
  address within seven days of such change.
    3. Notification to the city, as required by paragraphs 1 and 2 of this
  subdivision, may be submitted to the department electronically.
    d.  Indemnification and insurance. 1. Each person who owns or controls
  a newsrack placed or installed on any sidewalk shall indemnify and  hold
  the  city  harmless  from  any and all losses, costs, damages, expenses,
  claims, judgments or liabilities that the city may incur  by  reason  of
  the  placement,  installation or maintenance of such newsrack, except to
  the extent such damage results from the negligence or intentional act of
  the city.
    2. Each person who owns or controls a newsrack on any  sidewalk  shall
  maintain  a  general  liability  insurance policy naming the city of New
  York, and its departments, boards, officers,  employees  and  agents  as
  additional insureds for the specific purpose of indemnifying and holding
  harmless  those additional insureds from and against any and all losses,
  costs, damages, expenses, claims, judgments or liabilities  that  result
  from  or arise out of the placement, installation and/or the maintenance

  of any newsrack. The minimum limits of such insurance coverage shall  be
  no  less  than  three hundred thousand dollars combined single limit for
  bodily injury, including death, and property  damage,  except  that  any
  person  who maintains an average of one hundred or more newsracks at any
  one time shall maintain such minimum insurance coverage of  one  million
  dollars.  An  insurance  certificate  demonstrating  compliance with the
  requirements of this subdivision shall be submitted annually by December
  31st to the commissioner by the person who owns or controls such insured
  newsracks. Should said policy be called upon to  satisfy  any  liability
  for  damages covered by said policy, the policy must be of such a nature
  that the original amount of coverage is restored after  any  payment  of
  damages  under  the policy. Failure to maintain a satisfactory insurance
  policy pursuant to this subdivision  or  failure  to  submit  an  annual
  insurance  certificate to the commissioner pursuant to this subdivision,
  shall be deemed a violation of this section subject to subparagraph  b-1
  of paragraph one of subdivision f of this section.
    e.  Maintenance, continuous use, repair and removal. 1. Any person who
  owns or is in control of a newsrack shall certify once every four months
  to the commissioner on forms prescribed by the  commissioner  that  each
  newsrack  under  his  or her ownership or control has been repainted, or
  that  best  efforts  have  been  made  to  remove  graffiti  and   other
  unauthorized   writing,   painting,   drawing,   or  other  markings  or
  inscriptions at least once during the immediately preceding  four  month
  period.  Such  person shall maintain a log in which the measures and the
  dates and times when they are taken are recorded in  accordance  with  a
  format  approved  or  set  forth  by the commissioner. Such person shall
  maintain records for a period of three  years  documenting  the  use  of
  materials,  employees,  contractors,  other  resources  and expenditures
  utilized for the purpose of demonstrating the repainting or best efforts
  of such person to remove such graffiti or  other  unauthorized  writing,
  painting, drawing, or other markings or inscriptions. Such person shall,
  solely  for  the  purposes  of  complying  with  the  provisions of this
  paragraph, make such log and such records, and only such  log  and  such
  records,  available  to the department for inspection and copying during
  normal and regular business  hours  and  shall  deliver  copies  to  the
  department  upon  its  request. Such inspection may only be conducted by
  the  department  once  per  certification  period.  If  the   department
  determines  that  such  certification, log and records do not accurately
  demonstrate that an owner  or  person  in  control  of  a  newsrack  has
  repainted  or  used  best  efforts for such purposes as required by this
  paragraph, or upon a determination by the department that  an  owner  or
  such person failed to comply with any other provision of this paragraph,
  the  department  shall  issue  a  notice of violation in accordance with
  subparagraph b-1 of paragraph one of subdivision f of this section.
    2. Any person who owns or is in control of a newsrack shall  use  best
  efforts  to  ensure  that  each  newsrack  under his or her ownership or
  control is not used as a depository for  the  placement  of  refuse  and
  shall  be  required  to  remove  any  refuse placed within such newsrack
  within forty-eight hours of receipt of a notice of correction  from  the
  commissioner   as  provided  in  subparagraph  a  of  paragraph  one  of
  subdivision f of this section regarding such condition.
    3. In no event shall the owner or person in control of a newsrack fail
  to keep such newsrack supplied with written matter for a period of  more
  than  seven  consecutive days without securing the door so as to prevent
  the deposit of refuse therein. In no event shall  such  newsrack  remain
  empty for a period of more than thirty consecutive days.
    4. Any newsrack that has been damaged or is in need of repair shall be
  repaired,  replaced or removed by the owner or person in control of such

  newsrack within seven business days of receipt of a notice of correction
  from the commissioner as provided in subparagraph a of paragraph one  of
  subdivision  f of this section regarding such damage or need for repair.
  If  such newsrack has been damaged, or if it is in a state of disrepair,
  such that it constitutes a danger to persons or property,  it  shall  be
  made safe within a reasonable time following receipt of such a notice of
  correction from the commissioner regarding such condition.
    5.   Any  damage  to  city  property  resulting  from  the  placement,
  installation, maintenance or removal of a  newsrack  shall  be  repaired
  promptly  by  the  owner  or  person  in  control of such newsrack. If a
  newsrack is removed from its location on a sidewalk, the owner or person
  in control of such newsrack  shall  be  responsible  for  restoring  the
  sidewalk  and any other affected city property to the condition existing
  prior to installation of that newsrack.
    f. Enforcement. 1. (a)  Whenever  any  newsrack  is  found  to  be  in
  violation  of  any  provision  of  subdivision  b  of  this  section  or
  paragraphs two, three, four or five of subdivision e  of  this  section,
  the  commissioner shall issue a notice of correction specifying the date
  and nature of the violation and  shall  send  written  notification,  by
  regular  mail,  to  the  owner  or person in control of the newsrack. In
  addition, the commissioner may send a copy of such notice of  correction
  to  a  person designated by such owner or person to receive such notice,
  and/or the commissioner may send such notice by electronic mail to  such
  owner  or  such  person specifying the date and nature of the violation.
  However, failure to send a copy by regular or electronic mail  will  not
  extend  the  time  period  within  which  such  owner or other person is
  required by any provision of this section to take action, nor will  such
  failure result in the dismissal of a notice of violation issued pursuant
  to   any  provision  of  this  section.  The  commissioner  shall  cause
  photographic evidence of such violation to be taken. Such evidence shall
  be sent by regular mail together with the notice of  correction.  Except
  as  otherwise  provided  for  the  removal of refuse in paragraph two of
  subdivision e of this section, such person shall within  seven  business
  days from the date of receipt of notification via regular mail cause the
  violation to be corrected. For the purposes of this section, a notice of
  correction shall be deemed to have been received five days from the date
  on which it was mailed by the commissioner.
    (b)  If  an  owner  or  other person in control of a newsrack fails to
  comply with a notice of correction issued pursuant to subparagraph a  of
  this paragraph or an order by the commissioner to remove served pursuant
  to paragraph three of this subdivision, a notice of violation returnable
  to  the board shall be served on such owner or person in control of such
  newsrack. No notice of violation shall be  issued  for  the  failure  to
  comply  with a notice of correction issued pursuant to subparagraph a of
  paragraph one of this subdivision unless the commissioner has  caused  a
  second inspection of the violation to take place within a period of time
  that  commences  on  the  day after the applicable period for correcting
  such violation expires  and  ends  fourteen  days  after  such  day.  In
  addition,  the  commissioner  may  send to such owner or other person in
  control of such newsrack, by electronic mail, photographic  evidence  of
  such  violation  taken  at  such second inspection. Failure to send such
  photographic  evidence  by  electronic  mail  will  not  result  in  the
  dismissal  of  a notice of violation issued pursuant to any provision of
  this section.
    (b-1) Failure by an owner or a person in  control  of  a  newsrack  to
  comply with subdivision c or d of this section, failure by such owner or
  person  to  certify or failure to accurately demonstrate that such owner
  or person has repainted or used best  efforts  to  remove  graffiti  and

  other  unauthorized  writing,  painting,  drawing,  or other markings or
  inscriptions, as required by paragraph one  of  subdivision  e  of  this
  section,  shall  be  a  violation and shall be subject to the applicable
  penalties provided in paragraph six of this subdivision. A proceeding to
  recover  any  civil  penalty  authorized  by  this subparagraph shall be
  commenced with service on such owner or person of a notice of  violation
  returnable to the board. The commissioner shall not be required to issue
  a  notice  of correction before issuing or serving a notice of violation
  pursuant to this subparagraph.
    (c) If the return date of a notice of  violation  issued  pursuant  to
  subparagraph  b or b-1 of this paragraph is more than five business days
  after the service of such notice, the board shall, upon the  request  of
  the  respondent, in person at the office of the board, provide a hearing
  on such violation prior to such return  date  and  no  later  than  five
  business  days  after the date of such request. At the time set for such
  hearing, or at the date to which such hearing is  continued,  the  board
  shall  receive all evidence relevant to the occurrence or non-occurrence
  of the specified violation(s), the compliance or noncompliance with  any
  of  the  provisions of this section, and any other relevant information.
  Such hearing need not be conducted according to technical rules relating
  to evidence and witnesses. Oral evidence shall be taken only on oath  or
  affirmation.  Within  five  business  days  after  the conclusion of the
  hearing, the board shall render a decision, based upon the facts adduced
  at said hearing, whether any violations of this section  have  occurred.
  The  decision shall be in writing and shall contain findings of fact and
  a determination of the issues presented. The board  shall  send  to  the
  owner  or  person  in control of the newsrack by regular mail, a copy of
  its decision and order.
    2. (a) If the board renders a decision  upholding  the  finding  of  a
  violation  against  the  respondent upon default or after a hearing held
  pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision,  other  than  a  decision
  finding  a violation of the provisions of paragraph one of subdivision e
  of this section, and the violation is not remedied within seven days  of
  receipt  of  the  decision  of the board, the commissioner or his or her
  designee is authorized to provide for the removal of such  newsrack  and
  any  contents  thereof  to  a  place  of  safety.  For  purposes of this
  subparagraph, a decision shall be deemed to have been received five days
  from the date on which it was mailed. If such newsrack and any  contents
  thereof  are  not  claimed  within  thirty days after their removal by a
  person entitled to their return, they shall be deemed  to  be  abandoned
  and  may be either sold at a public auction after having been advertised
  in the City Record, the proceeds thereof being  paid  into  the  general
  fund,  used  or  converted  for  use  by  the department or another city
  agency, or otherwise disposed of, and the owner  or  person  in  control
  shall  be  liable  to  the City for the costs of removal and storage and
  shall be subject to a  civil  penalty  pursuant  to  subparagraph  a  of
  paragraph  six  of  subdivision  f  of  this  section. Newsracks and the
  contents thereof that are removed pursuant to this subparagraph shall be
  released to the owner or other person lawfully  entitled  to  possession
  upon  payment of the costs for removal and storage and any civil penalty
  or, if an action or proceeding concerning the violation is pending, upon
  the posting of a bond or  other  form  of  security  acceptable  to  the
  department  in  an amount that will secure the payment of such costs and
  any penalty that may be imposed hereunder.
    (b) If the board  renders  a  decision  upholding  the  finding  of  a
  violation against the respondent for having failed to certify, or having
  failed  to accurately demonstrate that such respondent repainted or used
  best  efforts  to  remove  graffiti  and  other  unauthorized   writing,

  painting, drawing, or other markings or inscriptions or having failed to
  comply  with  any  other  provision of paragraph one of subdivision e of
  this section, the board  shall  impose  a  penalty  in  accordance  with
  subparagraph b of paragraph six of this subdivision.
    3. The commissioner may, upon notice, serve an order upon the owner or
  other person in control of a newsrack requiring such person to remove or
  cause  to be removed such newsrack within seven business days of receipt
  of such order where  such  removal  is  required  because  the  site  or
  location  at  which such newsrack is placed is used or is to be used for
  public  utility  purposes,  public  transportation,  or  public   safety
  purposes,   or   when   such   newsrack   unreasonably  interferes  with
  construction activities in nearby or adjacent buildings, or  if  removal
  is  required  in  connection  with  a  street  widening or other capital
  project or improvement. If such person does  not  remove  such  newsrack
  within  seven  business  days  of  receipt of such order, the provisions
  contained in subparagraphs b and c of paragraph one of this  subdivision
  and  subparagraph  a  of  paragraph  two  of  this subdivision regarding
  issuance of a notice of violation and alternatives for removal, storage,
  abandonment, disposal, and release, shall apply.
    4. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the  contrary,  if  a
  newsrack  has been deemed to have been abandoned in accordance with this
  paragraph, the commissioner, his or her designee, an authorized  officer
  or  employee  of  any  city  agency or a police officer is authorized to
  provide for the removal of such newsrack and it may either  be  sold  at
  public  auction  after  having  been  advertised in the City Record, the
  proceeds thereof being paid into the general fund, used or converted for
  use by the department or another city agency, or otherwise disposed  of.
  A  newsrack  shall be deemed to have been abandoned for purposes of this
  paragraph if the name, address or  other  identifying  material  of  the
  owner or other person in control of such newsrack is not affixed to such
  newsrack  as required by paragraph four of subdivision b of this section
  and such owner or other person has not submitted to the commissioner the
  information required in clauses (ii) and  (iii)  of  subparagraph  a  of
  paragraph one of subdivision c of this section.
    5. (a) Where emergency circumstances exist and the commissioner or his
  or  her designee gives notice to the owner or other person in control of
  a newsrack to remove such newsrack, such person shall comply  with  such
  notice.  For  the  purposes  of  this paragraph, emergency circumstances
  shall mean circumstances which present  an  imminent  threat  to  public
  health or safety.
    (b)  If  any  owner  or other person in control of a newsrack does not
  remove such newsrack when directed to do so pursuant to  the  provisions
  of  subparagraph  a of this paragraph, or if circumstances are such that
  public safety requires the immediate removal of a newsrack and it is not
  reasonable to give the owner or other person in control of such newsrack
  notice prior to removal, the commissioner or his  or  her  designee  may
  provide for the removal of such newsrack to a place of safety. Unless an
  administrative  proceeding  brought  pursuant  to subparagraph c of this
  paragraph has terminated in favor of  such  owner  or  other  person  in
  control  of such newsrack, such owner or other person in control of such
  newsrack may be charged with the reasonable costs of removal and storage
  payable prior to the release of such newsrack and the contents thereof.
    (c) If an owner or other person in control  of  a  newsrack  fails  to
  comply with a notice issued pursuant to subparagraph a of this paragraph
  to  remove  such newsrack, a notice of violation returnable to the board
  shall be served on such owner or person in control of such newsrack.  If
  the  newsrack has been removed by the city pursuant to subparagraph b of
  this paragraph, such notice of violation  shall  be  served  immediately

  after  removal,  and,  if  the return date of the notice of violation is
  more than five business days after the service of such notice, the board
  shall, upon the request of the respondent, in person at  the  office  of
  the board, provide a hearing on such violation prior to such return date
  and no later than five business days after the date of such request. The
  hearing shall take place under the provisions set forth in subparagraphs
  b  and  c  of  paragraph one of this subdivision and a decision shall be
  rendered by the board within five business days after the conclusion  of
  the  hearing.  If  a decision is rendered at such hearing that emergency
  circumstances did not exist, such newsrack shall be returned within  ten
  days  to  the  location from which it was removed by the commissioner or
  his or her designee. If a decision is rendered  against  the  respondent
  upon  default  or  after  a  hearing  that  such emergency circumstances
  existed, such newsrack and the contents thereof shall be released to the
  owner or other person lawfully entitled to possession. If, after a board
  decision that removal was proper, such newsrack and any contents thereof
  are not claimed within thirty days after the date of removal by a person
  entitled to their return, such newsrack and any contents  thereof  shall
  be  deemed  abandoned  and  may be either sold at a public auction after
  having been advertised in the City Record, the  proceeds  thereof  being
  paid  into the general fund, used or converted for use by the department
  or another city agency, or otherwise disposed of.
    6. (a) Any owner or person in control of a newsrack  found  to  be  in
  violation of any provision of this section shall, after a board decision
  has  been  issued upon default or after a hearing, be subject to a civil
  penalty in the amount of (i) no less than fifty dollars and no more than
  one hundred dollars for each violation for a specific newsrack of any of
  the provisions of paragraphs two, three, four or five of  subdivision  e
  of  this  section  or  paragraph  four of subdivision b of this section,
  except that a person found in violation of any of such provisions  after
  a  decision of the board issued on default shall be subject to a penalty
  of no less than one hundred  dollars  and  no  more  than  five  hundred
  dollars;  (ii)  no  less than five hundred dollars and no more than four
  thousand dollars for each violation of paragraph one of subdivision c of
  this section; and (iii) no less than one hundred  dollars  and  no  more
  than  five  hundred  dollars  for each violation of paragraphs one, two,
  three, five, six and seven of subdivision b of this section.
    (b) Any owner or person in control of one or more newsracks  found  by
  the  board  to  have  failed to certify, or to have failed to accurately
  demonstrate that such owner or person repainted or used best efforts  to
  remove  graffiti  and  other unauthorized writing, painting, drawing, or
  other  markings  or  inscriptions,  as  required  by  paragraph  one  of
  subdivision  e  of  this  section,  or  failed  to comply with any other
  requirements of such paragraph, or failed to comply with  any  provision
  of paragraph two of subdivision c of this section, or failed to maintain
  insurance  as required by subdivision d of this section, shall be liable

  sidewalk for a period of three consecutive months,  every  newsrack  and
  the  contents  thereof  under the ownership or control of any person who
  repeatedly violates any provision or provisions of this subdivision. For
  purposes of this paragraph, a person shall be deemed to have  repeatedly
  violated  this  section if such person has been determined by the board,
  upon default or after a hearing, to have violated the provisions of this
  section ten or more times within any  six-month  period  and  that  such
  person  has  failed  to pay three or more civil penalties imposed during
  that same time period. For purposes of this paragraph,  a  person  shall
  also  be  deemed to have repeatedly violated this section if such person
  is determined by the board, upon default or after  a  hearing,  to  have
  failed   to   make  the  certification  required  by  paragraph  one  of
  subdivision  e  of  this  section  or  to  have  failed  to   accurately
  demonstrate  that  such  person repainted or used best efforts to remove
  graffiti and other unauthorized writing,  painting,  drawing,  or  other
  markings  or  inscriptions  as required by such paragraph in each of two
  consecutive certification periods in any two year period or three  times
  in  any  two-year  period. The department shall maintain a record of all
  persons who repeatedly violate  any  provision  or  provisions  of  this
  subdivision.  In the event that the commissioner removes or causes to be
  removed all newsracks and the contents thereof under  the  ownership  or
  control  of  any  person based upon this paragraph, such person shall be
  permitted to replace all such newsracks at the locations from which they
  were removed upon payment in full of  all  outstanding  civil  penalties
  imposed  for  violations  of  this  section  and the reasonable costs of
  removal and storage, provided that such newsracks meet the  requirements
  of  this  section. If any newsracks or contents thereof removed pursuant
  to  this  paragraph  are  not  claimed  within  thirty  days  after  the
  expiration  of  the  three-month  removal  period, such newsracks or the
  contents thereof shall be deemed abandoned and may  be  either  sold  at
  public  auction  after  having  been  advertised in the City Record, the
  proceeds thereof being paid into the general fund, used or converted for
  use by the department or another city agency or otherwise disposed of.
    8. In giving any notice of correction  or  serving  any  commissioners
  order  required under this section, except as otherwise provided by law,
  the commissioner may rely on the validity of any address (a)  posted  on
  the newsrack pursuant to paragraph four of subdivision b of this section
  as  the address of the owner or person in control of the newsrack or (b)
  submitted to the department pursuant to subdivision c of  this  section,

  and  shall  provide  such  notice  by  regular  mail.  If the owner of a
  newsrack or person in control of a newsrack shall have failed to  comply
  with  paragraph  four  of  subdivision  b  or with subdivision c of this
  section, the commissioner shall make reasonable efforts to ascertain the
  identity  and address of the owner or person in control of such newsrack
  for the purpose of giving any required notice, and having done  so,  may
  take action as if any required notice had been given.
    9.  Nothing  in this section shall preclude the immediate removal of a
  newsrack when otherwise authorized by law.
    g. Severability. If any subdivision, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence
  or clause of this section is for  any  reason  held  to  be  invalid  or
  unconstitutional by the decision of any court of competent jurisdiction,
  such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of
  this section.
