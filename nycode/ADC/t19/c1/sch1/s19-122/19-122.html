  environmental protection or the commissioner of design and construction,
  who may hereafter pave or cause to be paved any street, shall remove the
  sand, dirt, rubbish or debris from such street and every  part  thereof,
  within  seven  days  after  the  pavement  shall have been completed. In
  addition to any penalties which may be imposed  for  violation  of  this

  debris to be removed at the expense of the party neglecting or  refusing
  so  to do, who shall be liable for the amount expended by the city. This
  section shall be so construed as to apply to the removal  of  all  sand,
  dirt,  rubbish  or  debris  collected in any part of any and all streets
  covered by any pavement so done or laid, or  excavation  that  may  have
  been made, or other work done in pursuance thereof.
