<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  19-167.3  Deactivating  muni-meters.  a.  For  the purposes of this
  section, the term "muni-meter" shall mean an  electronic  parking  meter
  that  dispenses  timed  receipts that must be displayed in a conspicuous
  place on a vehicle's dashboard.
    b. The department shall program each muni-meter to  ensure  that  such
  muni-meter is unable to accept payment:
    1.  from the last time in a day that parking meter rules are in effect
  for any parking  space  within  the  block  or  parking  field  of  such
  muni-meter,  or  for  any other parking space within one hundred feet of
  such muni-meter, until one hour prior to the next time meter rules  take
  effect  for  any parking space within the block or parking field, or for
  any other parking space within one hundred feet of such muni-meter; and
    2. when  such  muni-meter  does  not  contain  paper  to  print  timed
  receipts.
    c. This section shall apply only to muni-meters that can be programmed
  as  set  forth  in subdivision b of this section, provided that no later
  than two years after the enactment of the  local  law  that  added  this
  section,  all  muni-meters  in  the city of New York shall be capable of
  being programmed in  the  manner  required  by  subdivision  b  of  this
  section.
