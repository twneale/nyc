    &sect;  19-162 Permissible parking for certain purposes. 1. Notwithstanding
  any local law  or  regulation  to  the  contrary,  but  subject  to  the
  provisions of the vehicle and traffic law, it shall be permissible for a
  bus  owned,  used or hired by public or nonpublic schools to park at any
  time, including overnight, upon any street or roadway, provided said bus
  occupies a parking spot in front of and within the building lines of the
  premises of the said public school or nonpublic school.
    2.  Notwithstanding  the  department  of   transportation   regulation
  prohibiting   parking  in  front  of  private  driveways,  it  shall  be
  permissible for the owner or lessor of the lot accessed by such driveway
  to park a passenger vehicle registered to him or her at that address  in
  front  of  such  driveway,  provided that such lot does not contain more
  than two dwelling units and, further provided that such parking does not
  violate any other provision of the vehicle and traffic law or local law,
  rule or regulation concerning the  parking,  stopping,  or  standing  of
  motor  vehicles.  The  hearing  officer  shall  dismiss  any  notice  of
  violation issued to the owner of such  passenger  vehicle  upon  receipt
  from  the  owner,  in  person  or  by  mail,  of  a  copy of the vehicle
  registration containing the same address as that at which the ticket was
  given or other suitable evidence showing compliance with  the  law.  The
  director of the bureau shall set forth the proof required in the case of
  lots  where  confusion  may  arise including, but not limited to, corner
  lots or lots with dual addresses.
