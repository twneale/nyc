Section 19-167.2

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  19-167.2  Transfer  of muni-meter time. a. For the purposes of this
  section, the term "muni-meter" shall mean an  electronic  parking  meter
  that  dispenses  timed  receipts that must be displayed in a conspicuous
  place on a vehicle's dashboard.
    b. Parking time that is purchased at a muni-meter shall be  valid  for
  use  during such time at any parking space where parking meter rules are
  in effect, provided that:
    1. the parking meter rate at such parking space is the same as or less
  than the rate at the location where such parking time was purchased;
    2. the vehicle is not parked at such parking space in  excess  of  the
  maximum  amount  of  time parking is authorized at such parking space as
  indicated on posted signs. For purposes of this paragraph, the length of
  time a vehicle is parked at a parking space shall be calculated from the
  time such parking time was purchased, as  indicated  on  the  muni-meter
  receipt; and
    3.  the  vehicle  is  not  otherwise parked in violation of any law or
  rule.
