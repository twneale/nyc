Section 19-175

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;   19-175   Variance  for  special  events.  a.  Notwithstanding  the
  provisions of section 20-381.1 of the code, the owner or operator  of  a
  horse  drawn cab may apply for a variance from the provisions of section
  20-381.1 for the limited purpose of carrying out a contract to provide a
  horse drawn  cab  for  the  filming  of  a  movie,  television  show  or
  commercial, or for a wedding, parade, or other special event as shall be
  defined  by  the commissioner by rule. The commissioner shall grant such
  variance when he or she determines that the issuance  of  such  variance
  would  not have an adverse effect on vehicular or pedestrian congestion,
  commencement of theatrical productions or public safety.
    b. A variance application shall be in such form as prescribed  by  the
  commissioner  and  shall  be submitted to the commissioner no fewer than
  three business days prior to  the  date  of  the  event  for  which  the
  variance is requested.
    c.  The  commissioner  may  require  the  payment  of  an  application
  processing fee in an amount to be established by rule.
    d. The commissioner shall issue a document  specifying  the  variance.
  Whenever  a  horse drawn cab is being operated in accordance with a duly
  issued variance, such variance shall be carried by the  driver  of  such
  horse  drawn  cab  and  shall be produced upon the demand of any police,
  traffic, parks  or  other  enforcement  officer  authorized  to  enforce
  section 20-381.1 of the code.
    e.  Use  of  a variance by any person other than the person to whom it
  was issued, or for any purpose other than the purpose for which  it  was
  issued,  shall subject the person using such variance to a civil penalty
  of not less than five hundred dollars.
