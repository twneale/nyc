<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  19-174  Passengers  boarding  horse drawn cabs. a. The commissioner
  shall designate by rule specific locations on the streets,  avenues  and
  roadways  which  shall  be the sole locations where passengers may board
  horse drawn cabs if such passengers  have  not  prearranged  such  horse
  drawn  cab  rides  in accordance with the provisions of subdivision b of
  this section and any rules promulgated pursuant thereto.
    b. (1) Horse drawn cabs may accept passengers on a  prearranged  basis
  in  areas  and  at  times  that  are  not restricted pursuant to section
  20-381.1 of the code. Such prearranged rides shall commence in front  of
  hotels  and  restaurants that have obtained the approval of the owner of
  the premises at which such hotel or restaurant is located.
    (2) This subdivision shall not be construed to permit  the  operation,
  parking,  stopping or standing of any horse drawn cab in any area at any
  time where or when such operation,  parking,  stopping  or  standing  is
  prohibited by any other law or rule.
    c.  The  department  shall annually review existing locations of horse
  drawn cab stands and any proposals by the  department  and  any  written
  proposals by others to establish or eliminate horse drawn cab stands and
  shall  report  the  results of such review to the mayor and the council.
  This report shall include a list of those locations proposed to be added
  or eliminated, those considered by the department, the reasons  why  any
  proposal  was  not  considered and the reasons why the department did or
  did not establish or eliminate a horse drawn cab stand at each  proposed
  location  that  was  considered.  Such  report shall be submitted to the
  mayor and the council within sixty days after the close  of  the  fiscal
  year.
