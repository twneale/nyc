    d.  Where  a  permit  issued  pursuant  to  this section is used for a
  purpose other than official duties as set forth in this section or by  a
  person  other  than the member of the clergy indicated in an application

  allowed such unauthorized use of the permit shall not  be  eligible  for
  inclusion  in  an application pursuant to this section. The commissioner

  of  this  section  and  shall set such fee as may be appropriate for the
  issuance of permits pursuant to this section.
