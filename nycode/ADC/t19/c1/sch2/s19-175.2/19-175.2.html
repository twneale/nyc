Section 19-175.2

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  19-175.2  Notification  of  changes  in  parking  restrictions.  a.
  Following any permanent change in parking  restrictions  posted  by  the
  department,  the  department  shall  post notice, in the affected areas,
  indicating the effective date of  such  change.  An  owner  of  a  motor
  vehicle  parked in the affected areas who receives a notice of a parking
  violation that occurred within five days of posting of the notice of the
  parking restriction change shall have an affirmative  defense  that  the
  vehicle  of  the  owner  was  parked  in  compliance with the applicable
  parking restriction that was in effect prior to such change. Within  one
  business  day of making a permanent change in parking restrictions, such
  change will be reflected on the website containing parking  restrictions
  as required by section 19-175.1 of the code.
    b.  Before  the department makes temporary parking restriction changes
  to conduct road repairs, it shall post notice of the effective  date  of
  such  restrictions  as soon as practicable. Such notice shall state that
  no notice of violations shall be issued for violations of such temporary
  parking restrictions and that if an owner's  motor  vehicle  is  missing
  from the affected streets, the motor vehicle may have been towed and the
  motor  vehicle  owner  should  contact  the  local  police  precinct for
  information about the location of such motor vehicle.
    c. Following the issuance by the office of the mayor of a permit  that
  authorizes  filming  and/or  related  activity and that provides special
  parking privileges or the temporary suspension of parking  restrictions,
  the party to whom the permit is issued shall post notice of such parking
  restriction  changes  immediately  in  the  affected  areas. Such notice
  shall,  at  a  minimum,  state  the  temporary  change  in  the  parking
  restrictions,  the  date  on which such change will take effect, that no
  notice of violations shall be issued for  violations  of  the  temporary
  parking  restrictions  and  that  if an owner's motor vehicle is missing
  from the affected streets, the motor vehicle may have been towed and the
  motor vehicle  owner  should  contact  the  local  police  precinct  for
  information about the location of such motor vehicle.
    d.  Following the issuance by the office of the mayor of a permit that
  authorizes a sponsor to  conduct  a  street  fair  or  parade  and  that
  provides  special  parking  privileges  or  the  temporary suspension of
  parking restrictions, the sponsor shall  post  notice  of  such  parking
  restriction  changes  on  a form provided by the office of the mayor, in
  the affected areas, at least seven days prior to the date on which  such
  change  will  take  effect.  Such  notice shall, at a minimum, state the
  temporary change in the parking restrictions and  the  date  the  change
  will take effect.
    e.  Nothing  in  this  section  shall  be  construed  to  require  the
  department or any applicable city agency to provide notice of  temporary
  parking restriction changes when required to preserve public safety.
