Section 19-180

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;19-180  Performance  indicators. a. For the purposes of this section,
  the following terms shall be defined as follows:
    1. "Bicycle screen lines" shall  mean  locations  where  bicycles  are
  ridden,  including  but  not  limited  to greenways, roadways and bridge
  crossings.
    2. "Borough screen lines" shall mean locations  where  roadways  cross
  between boroughs.
    3.  "City  screen lines" shall mean locations where roadways enter the
  city.
    4.  "High  performance  modes"  shall   mean   a   form   of   surface
  transportation   other   than  automobiles,  including  buses,  ferries,
  bicycling and walking, that more efficiently uses roadways and waterways
  to move people.
    5. "Key corridors" shall mean major arterial roadways where changes in
  street operations, such as lane reapportionments, lane reconfigurations,
  significant adjustments in traffic and parking regulations  and  changes
  in  traffic  signal timing have been completed, are being implemented or
  are being studied.
    b. The department shall develop  and  monitor  performance  indicators
  that  will  assist  in  assessing  and reducing the amount of traffic on
  transportation  infrastructure  and  promote  high   performance   modes
  citywide and within each borough. Such indicators shall include:
    1.  vehicle volume data at city screen lines, borough screen lines and
  river crossings.
    2. vehicle volume data and other data where appropriate, including but
  not limited to vehicle  speed,  bus  speed  and  ridership,  pedestrian,
  bicycle and crash data, on key corridors.
    3.  vehicle  speed  data  to  be determined utilizing available global
  positioning systems data.
    4. bicycle volume data based on bicycle screen lines.
    5.  ferry  volume  data  based  upon  information  on  ridership  from
  city-operated and private ferry services.
    c. The performance indicators developed pursuant to this section shall
  be  measured  and  reported  citywide  and by borough by the department,
  submitted in a written report to the speaker  of  the  council  and  the
  mayor and posted on the department's official website by November 1st of
  each following calendar year. Where such report provides information for
  a  key corridor, such report shall provide performance indicators before
  and after construction or  project  implementation.  Such  report  shall
  include  information for each indicator from the prior calendar year and
  shall  describe  departmental  assessments  about  the  projects   where
  appropriate.
