Section 19-180.1

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  19-180.1  Safety audits of crash locations involving pedestrians a.
  Within one hundred and eighty days of receiving access to New York state
  department of motor vehicles traffic  crash  data  involving  pedestrian
  injuries  or  fatalities  for the previous calendar year, the department
  shall:
    1. Identify the twenty highest crash locations based upon a ranking of
  the total number of crashes involving pedestrians  killed  or  seriously
  injured,  occurring  over a five-year period and selected proportionally
  by  borough  based  upon  the  percentage  of  total  crashes  involving
  pedestrians in such borough; and
    2.  Inspect and conduct audits at such locations and, where warranted,
  make improvements or incorporate improvements into capital projects.
    b. Within  thirty  days  of  completing  the  inspections  and  audits
  required  under  paragraph  2  of  subdivision  a  of  this section, the
  department shall send a report noting  such  inspection  and  audit  and
  summarizing  its  recommendations  and  steps  to  be taken, including a
  schedule to implement such recommendations, to the  council  member  and
  community board in whose district the crash location is located.
    c.  If  any  crash location appears on the department's annual list of
  twenty highest crash locations involving pedestrians more than  once  in
  five  consecutive  years, such location shall be removed from the annual
  list and replaced by the  location  with  the  next  highest  number  of
  crashes  involving  pedestrians  located  within the same borough as the
  consecutively appearing location; provided  that  the  department  shall
  continue  to  monitor such crash data and/or make safety improvements at
  such removed location until such removed location is no  longer  one  of
  the highest crash locations.
    d.  For purposes of this section, "seriously injured" shall mean those
  injuries categorized as "A" injuries by the New York state department of
  motor vehicles.
