Section 19-188

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  19-188  Accessible  pedestrian  signals  program. a. The department
  shall establish an accessible pedestrian signals  program.  As  part  of
  this   program,   the  department  shall  identify  intersections  where
  accessible pedestrian signals may  be  installed  based  on  guidelines,
  including,  but  not  limited  to,  those  set  forth in the most recent
  version  of  the  manual  on  uniform  traffic  control   devices.   The
  department,  after  consultation with the mayor's office for people with
  disabilities and with advocates for and members of the visually impaired
  community, shall  identify  intersections  which  reflect  the  greatest
  crossing  difficulty  for persons with visual impairments. Commencing in
  2012, the department shall annually install, based on  such  guidelines,
  an   accessible   pedestrian   signal  at  each  corner  of  twenty-five
  intersections identified by the department following such consultation.
    b. On or before November 30, 2012, and on or before every November  30
  thereafter,  the department shall post on its website a report analyzing
  the status of the accessible  pedestrian  signals  program  which  shall
  include,  but  not  be  limited to, a detailed assessment of the program
  including cost, funding sources for  such  program  including,  but  not
  limited   to  city,  state  and  federal  funding,  recommendations  for
  improvements to such program, availability of new technology that may be
  employed by the department for use in such program  and  any  additional
  intersections in the city that may warrant inclusion in such program. In
  addition,  such report shall list the fifty top ranked intersections for
  new accessible pedestrian signals, as evaluated by the department  after
  consultation  with  the  mayor's office for people with disabilities and
  with advocates for and members of the visually impaired community, based
  on the criteria set forth in subdivision a of this section.
    c. The department shall post on its website the locations of all  such
  accessible  pedestrian  signals, disaggregated by community district and
  council district.
