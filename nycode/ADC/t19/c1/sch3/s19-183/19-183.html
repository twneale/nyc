  the following terms shall have the following meanings:
    1. "School" shall mean any educational facility under the jurisdiction
  of  the  New York city department of education and any non-public school
  that provides educational instructions to students at or below the ninth

    2. "Senior" shall mean any person sixty-five years or older.
    3. "Traffic calming device" shall mean any device, not governed by the
  manual on uniform traffic control devices, including,  but  not  limited
  to, speed humps, curb extensions, traffic diverters, median barriers and
  raised  walkways,  installed on a street and intended to slow, reduce or

    b.  The  department  shall establish guidelines governing the approval

  streets, such as locations adjacent to senior centers and nursing homes,
  and any other locations as determined by the department. Such guidelines
