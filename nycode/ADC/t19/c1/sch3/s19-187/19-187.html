    &sect;  19-187  Community  board hearings on the construction or removal of
  bicycle lanes. a. Definitions. For the purposes  of  this  section,  the
  following terms shall be defined as follows:
    1.  "Affected council member(s) and community board(s)" shall mean the
  council member(s) and community board(s) in whose districts  a  proposed
  bicycle lane is to be constructed or removed, in whole or in part.
    2.  "Bicycle  lane"  shall mean a portion of the roadway that has been
  marked off or  separated  for  the  preferential  or  exclusive  use  of
  bicycles.
    b.  1.  Except  as  provided  below,  at  least ninety days before the
  construction or  the  removal  of  a  bicycle  lane  is  to  begin,  the
  department shall notify each affected council member and community board
  via  electronic  mail  of the proposed plans for the bicycle lane within
  the affected community district and shall offer to make  a  presentation
  at a public hearing held by such affected community board.
    2.  If the affected community board accepts the offer made pursuant to
  paragraph  one  of  this  subdivision  and  holds  such  hearing  within
  forty-five  days  of  the  department  sending the notice required under
  paragraph  one  of  this  subdivision,  the  department  shall  make   a
  presentation  of  the  proposed  plans at such public hearing to receive
  input on such plans and shall not construct or remove such bicycle  lane
  until forty-five days after such public hearing.
    3.  When  notice  is  given  under  paragraph  one of this subdivision
  between June 20 and August 6, the period  for  a  public  hearing  under
  paragraph  two  of  this  subdivision  shall  conclude  on September 20;
  provided that the department may construct or remove such  bicycle  lane
  at  the conclusion of the ninety day notice period provided in paragraph
  one of this subdivision or ten days following such hearing, whichever is
  later.
    c. The department shall consider comments from  such  public  hearings
  and  may  incorporate  changes, where appropriate, into its bicycle lane
  plan or cancel plans for construction or removal of  such  bicycle  lane
  where it determines such bicycle lane would be inappropriate.
    d.  Section 19-101.2 of this title shall not apply to any bicycle lane
  that falls under the provisions of this section, except that subdivision
  j of section 19-101.2 shall apply where construction or removal of  such
  bicycle  lane  would  otherwise  be  defined  as  a major transportation
  project under paragraph 2 of subdivision a of section 19-101.2  of  this
  title.
