    &sect;  19-182  Comprehensive  study  of  pedestrian fatalities and serious
  injuries.  a.  Every  five  years,  the  department  shall   conduct   a
  comprehensive  study  of  all  traffic  crashes  involving  a pedestrian
  fatality or serious injury for the most recent five years where  traffic
  crash  data  is  available.  In  each  such  study, the department shall
  analyze the conditions and factors associated  with  each  such  traffic
  crash  and  identify  common  factors  among  the  crashes,  if any. The
  department shall use such  studies  to  develop  strategies  to  improve
  pedestrian   safety,   which  may  include  modifying  citywide  traffic
  operations  policy,  developing  pedestrian  safety  strategies   geared
  towards  specific  users, including, but not limited to, installation of
  audible pedestrian signals and other devices to assist those with sight,
  hearing and mobility impairments, prioritizing locations and/or types of
  roadways  or  intersections   for   safety   improvements   and   making
  recommendations for improving safety at such locations.
    b.  The  first  comprehensive  traffic  study  and  plans, including a
  schedule for implementing strategies  for  improving  pedestrian  safety
  generated  by such study, shall be submitted to the mayor and speaker of
  the council and posted on  the  department's  official  website  by  the
  thirtieth  day of november, two thousand and fifteen. Subsequent studies
  and plans shall be submitted to the mayor and speaker of the council and
  posted on the department's official website every five years  thereafter
  by the thirtieth of november in such years.
