    (vii)  If  the department in consultation with the office of the mayor

  consultation with the office of the mayor shall provide a report to  the
  mayor,  speaker  of the council, and the borough presidents of Manhattan
  and  Staten  Island  describing  the  reasons  why  fully expanding such
  service is not economically feasible  by  April  1,  2015,  which  shall
  include  but  not  be  limited  to the following factors: an analysis of
  ridership numbers, including a breakdown by time of trip, day and  month
  of  the year; a review of any recent or anticipated economic development
  or other economic or population changes  that  have  affected  or  could
  affect  ridership numbers; and plans for future expansion in service and
  a timeline for such expansion. Every two years thereafter by April 1 the
  department in consultation with the office of  the  mayor  shall  review
  such  determination  and  provide  a report to the mayor, speaker of the
  council, and the borough presidents  of  Manhattan  and  Staten  Island,
  including  but  not  limited  to  the  foregoing  factors  as  well as a
  description of any expansion of service since the enactment of the local
  law that added this paragraph.
    b. The schedule of service set forth in subdivision a of this  section
  shall not apply to service disruptions resulting from security concerns,
  mechanical   malfunctions   of   a  ferry,  unsafe  weather  conditions,
  emergencies or other similar events beyond the control of the department
  that would prevent compliance with such schedule. In the  event  of  any
  such disruption in the schedule of service set forth in subdivision a of
  this  section that lasts longer than twenty-four hours, the commissioner
  or a designee shall submit a written report to the mayor and speaker  of
  the  council which shall include the specific reasons for the disruption
  and the time at which service was restored.  If  service  has  not  been
  restored by the time the report must be submitted, the report shall also
  include the estimated duration of the disruption in service and what, if
  any,  attempts are being made to mitigate the loss of scheduled service.
  In the event a disruption in the schedule of service lasts  longer  than
  seven  days,  on  the  eighth  day  and every seven days thereafter, the
  commissioner or a designee shall submit a written report  to  the  mayor
  and speaker of the council that shall include an update on the status of
  resuming service.
