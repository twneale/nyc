  or newly operated by the city  meets  the  then  current  United  States
  environmental  protection  agency's  air  quality  standards  for marine
  engines, provided that such standards shall be at least as stringent  as
  the  United  States environmental protection agency's Tier 2 air quality
  standards for marine engines, shall meet the requirements of subdivision
  c of this section.
    (4) Any diesel fuel-powered city ferry that is  in  use  thirty  years
  after  being  placed  into  service  or  at  least seven years after the
  installation of best available technology  and  cannot  be  retrofitted,
  upgraded  or  repowered  to  comply with the United States environmental

  protection agency's Tier 2 air quality  standards  for  marine  engines,
  shall be retired.
    e.  (1)  The  commissioner  shall  make determinations, subject to the
  written approval of the commissioner of  environmental  protection,  and
  shall  publish  a  list  of such determinations as to the best available
  technology to be used for each class of city ferry to which this section
  applies for the purposes of subdivision c of  this  section.  Each  such
  determination,  which  shall be reviewed and revised as needed but in no
  event less often than once every six months, shall  be  based  upon  the
  reduction  in  emissions  of  particulate  matter  and  the reduction in
  emissions of nitrogen oxides associated with the use of such  technology
  and  shall  in no event result in an increase in the emissions of either
  such pollutant. In determining the best available  technology  for  each
  class  of  city ferry, the commissioner shall select technology that has
  been certified by the United States environmental protection  agency  or
  approved  by the United States coast guard or such other technology that
  the commissioner determines is at  least  as  stringent  as  the  United
  States  environmental protection agency Tier 2 air quality standards for
  marine engines.
    (2)  The  city  shall  not  be  required  to  replace  best  available
  technology  for  reducing the emission of pollutants or other authorized
  technology utilized for a diesel fuel-powered city ferry  in  accordance
  with  the  provisions  of paragraph one of subdivision c of this section
  within seven years of having first utilized  such  technology  for  such
  ferry.
    f.  This  section  shall not apply: (i) where federal or state funding
  precludes the city from imposing the requirements of  this  section;  or
  (ii)  to  purchases  that are emergency procurements pursuant to section
  three hundred fifteen of the charter.
    g.  Subdivision  b  of  this  section  shall  not  apply   where   the
  commissioner,  subject  to  the  written approval of the commissioner of
  environmental protection, makes a  written  finding  that  a  sufficient
  quantity  of  ultra  low sulfur diesel fuel is not available to meet the
  requirements of subdivision b of this section or is not  technically  or
  operationally  feasible;  provided that the city, shall maximize its use
  of ultra low sulfur diesel fuel with a sulfur content of  fifteen  parts
  per  million, and further provided that any diesel fuel used that is not
  ultra low sulfur diesel fuel contains the  next  lowest  sulfur  content
  available.    Any finding made pursuant to this subdivision shall expire
  after six months, at which time the requirements  of  subdivision  b  of
  this  section  shall be in full force and effect unless the commissioner
  renews the finding in writing and such renewal is approved in writing by
  the commissioner of environmental protection.
    h. Subdivision  c  of  this  section  shall  not  apply  to  a  diesel
  fuel-powered  city ferry where the commissioner makes a written finding,
  which is approved  in  writing  by  the  commissioner  of  environmental
  protection, that the best available technology for reducing the emission
  of  pollutants  as  required by that subdivision is unavailable for such
  city ferry, is not technically, operationally or economically  feasible,
  or  is  not  available  on  the  required  time  table  due to delays in
  manufacturing such technology or in the  availability  of  dry  dock  or
