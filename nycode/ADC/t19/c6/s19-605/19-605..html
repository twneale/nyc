    &sect;  19-605.  Air-conditioning.  a.  Any  bus  or  other  motor  vehicle
  transporting a child with a disability to and from a school in the  city
  pursuant  to any agreement or contract shall be air-conditioned when the
  ambient outside temperature exceeds seventy degrees Fahrenheit.  Drivers
  of  all  such  vehicles  shall  utilize such air conditioning systems in
  order to make the internal  climate  of  such  vehicles  comfortable  to
  passengers  in  order  to protect or enhance the health of children with
  disabilities.   Any   failure,   mechanical   or   otherwise,   of    an
  air-conditioning  system  required by this section shall be repaired and
  restored to operable condition as soon as  is  practicable,  but  in  no
  event  more  than  three  business  days  subsequent to the failure. For
  purposes of this section, "child with a disability" shall mean  a  child
  with a disability as defined in section 4401(1) of the education law who
  requires an air-conditioned environment for health reasons.
    b.  The penalty provisions set forth in section 19-607 of this chapter
  shall not apply to any violation of the provisions of this section.  Any
  owner,  operator or contractor responsible for transporting a child with
  a disability to and from a school in the city pursuant to any  agreement
  or  contract shall be liable for a civil penalty of four hundred dollars
  for each violation of this section.
