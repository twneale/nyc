Section 19-606

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  19-606 School bus service. a. Except as provided in subdivisions d,
  e and f of this section, no student shall be allowed to board  a  school
  bus  operated  by  or pursuant to a contract with the board of education
  unless a seat is available for the student.
    b. The board of education shall prepare and,  when  necessary,  revise
  two  school  bus  service  plans  annually  to  ensure that all students
  eligible to receive school bus service to  and  from  the  schools  they
  legally  attend  shall be provided with a seat on a school bus. One plan
  shall relate to school bus service to be provided during the session  of
  the  school  year beginning in September and ending in June and one plan
  shall relate to school bus service to be provided during a summer school
  session. Each plan shall be prepared prior  to  the  first  day  of  the
  session  of  the  school  year to which it relates and shall include the
  following information: (i) the criteria used by the board  of  education
  to  determine  whether  a  student  is  eligible  to  receive school bus
  service; (ii) for each school, a summary description of the  school  bus
  routes servicing the school; (iii) for each school bus route, the number
  of  students  eligible  to ride on the school bus operating on the route
  and the maximum seating capacity of such school bus; and (iv) any  other
  information  the  board  of education deems relevant. Upon completion of
  the plans, they shall be submitted to the mayor and the speaker  of  the
  city council.
    c.  If  at  any time during any session of a school year the number of
  students eligible to ride on a school  bus  operating  on  a  particular
  school  bus route exceeds the maximum seating capacity of the school bus
  operating on such  route,  the  board  of  education  shall  revise  the
  affected school bus service plan, and take all steps necessary to ensure
  that  all  students  eligible to receive school bus service are provided
  with a seat on a school bus. A revised plan shall identify  any  changes
  to  the information provided pursuant to paragraphs (i), (ii), (iii) and
  (iv) of subdivision b of this section and, in addition, shall  describe,
  for  each  school bus route affected by the revision, the steps taken to
  ensure that the number of students eligible to  ride  on  a  school  bus
  operating  on  a particular school bus route does not exceed the maximum
  seating capacity of  the  school  bus  operating  on  such  route.  Upon
  completion of a revised plan, it shall be submitted to the mayor and the
  speaker of the city council.
    d.  Not  later  than ten days prior to the first day of the session of
  the school year beginning in September, and  not  later  than  ten  days
  prior  to  the  first  day  of  a  summer  school  session, the board of
  education shall prepare, and provide to each bus company  that  will  be
  transporting  students  to or from school, lists of students eligible to
  ride on the school buses operating on the school bus routes serviced  by
  such  bus company. A separate list shall be compiled for each school bus
  route.  Each list shall identify each eligible student by  name,  school
  bus  stop  and  school,  but  shall  not  contain  any other information
  relating to such student. The board of education shall require that  bus
  companies  provide  to  bus drivers the list appropriate for each school
  bus route. The board of education shall prepare, and promptly provide to
  each bus company, revised and updated lists  that  reflect  any  changes
  necessary  to comply with the requirements of this section. All students
  listed as eligible to receive school bus service on a particular  school
  bus  route  shall  be entitled to board the school bus operating on such
  route. During transport to school at the beginning of the regular school
  day, students not listed as eligible to receive school bus service on  a
  particular school bus route shall not be allowed to board the school bus
  operating  on  such  route,  provided, however, that where such students
  waiting to board such school bus are not accompanied by  an  adult,  the

  bus  driver  shall  allow such students to board such school bus. During
  transport from school at the close of the regular school  day,  students
  not  listed  as  eligible  to receive school bus service on a particular
  school  bus route shall not be allowed to board the school bus operating
  on such route unless authorized to do so by personnel  assigned  by  the
  principal pursuant to subdivision e of this section.
    e.  The  principal  of  each  school  to  or  from  which students are
  transported by school bus shall assign  personnel  to  monitor  students
  exiting  school  buses  at  the  beginning of the regular school day and
  boarding school buses at the close  of  the  regular  school  day.  Such
  personnel  shall be provided with the same lists provided to bus drivers
  pursuant to subdivision d of this section. Such personnel shall: (i)  at
  the  close  of  the  regular  school  day,  determine whether to allow a
  student not listed as eligible  to  receive  school  bus  service  on  a
  particular  school  bus  route to board the school bus operating on such
  route; (ii) notify the parent or legal guardian of such student that  he
  or  she  has been or may be prohibited from boarding a school bus; (iii)
  provide the  parent  or  legal  guardian  with  the  name,  address  and
  telephone  number  of  the  office responsible for determining whether a
  student is eligible to receive school bus service; (iv) for each  school
  bus,  maintain  a  record of students not listed as eligible who exit or
  board the bus; and (v)  determine  whether  information  regarding  such
  students  should  be  referred to the office responsible for determining
  whether a student is eligible to receive school bus service  and,  where
  appropriate,  report  such  information  to such office. The information
  reported to such office, together with such other  relevant  information
  available  to the board of education, shall be considered in determining
  whether and how to revise the  affected  school  bus  service  plan  and
  revise  and  update  the  lists  of eligible students in accordance with
  subdivisions c and d of this section.
    f.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this  section  to  the
  contrary,  during  the  first ten days of the session of the school year
  beginning in September and during the first ten days of a summer  school
  session,  a  student  waiting at a school bus stop to board a school bus
  transporting students to the school  attended  by  the  student  may  be
  allowed  to  board the school bus, whether or not such student is listed
  as eligible to receive school bus service on that school bus route  and,
  at  the  close  of  the  regular school day, may be allowed to board the
  school bus stopping at such school bus stop.
    g. The provisions of this section shall apply  only  to  those  school
  buses operated by or pursuant to a contract with the board of education.
