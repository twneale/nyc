  The council hereby finds that a  serious  emergency  exists  as  to  the
  safety of handicapped children transported to and from schools in school
  buses   and  other  vehicles.  Handicapped  school  children  have  been
  grievously injured, maimed and killed due to  lack  of  seat  belts  and
  guards  or  escorts  on school buses. The council finds that in order to
  prevent  further  tragedies  to  our  handicapped  school  children  the
  provisions  of  this  section are declared necessary and are designed to
  protect, the safety, health and general welfare of our school children.
