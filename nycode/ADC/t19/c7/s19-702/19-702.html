Section 19-702

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  19-702  Legislative  findings  and intent. The Council hereby finds
  that the city of New York's water borne commuter services facilities are
  not uniformly accessible to  disabled  persons.  This  is  a  matter  of
  serious  concern  affecting  the  public safety and welfare. The Council
  believes that there is an immediate need for regulation of  water  borne
  commuter  services  in order to enable disabled members of the public to
  have access to  such  services  on  an  equal  basis  with  non-disabled
  persons. The Council believes that under the Americans with Disabilities
  Act   (ADA),   disabled  persons  have  the  right  to  access  commuter
  transportation  services  on  an  equal  and  non-discriminatory  basis.
  However,  the  Council  finds  that  no  federal or state laws, rules or
  regulations are in effect that establish  specific  standards  regarding
  access  by  disabled persons to water borne commuter services facilities
  in  the  city  or  the  safety  of  such  persons  when  utilizing  such
  facilities.  As  a  result, disabled persons in the city of New York are
  not assured that they can safely and  consistently  access  water  borne
  commuter  services  facilities. This legislation sets specific standards
  in relation  to  mandating  accessible  water  borne  commuter  services
  facilities  for  disabled persons, thereby minimizing the tremendous and
  unfair burden placed on disabled persons who rely on these services.
    The Council further finds that the  city's  transportation  needs  and
  system are unique in that, unlike many other cities, major waterways are
  interspersed  throughout  the  greater  New York city area, resulting in
  residential concentrations that are in many instances separated by water
  from major centers of employment. Consequently,  the  city  historically
  has  had  an  extensive  passenger ferry system. Furthermore, because of
  increasing levels of traffic congestion and air pollution, and  concerns
  regarding  the threat of terrorism to other modes of transportation, the
  city is rapidly developing an increasingly expansive system of passenger
  ferry transportation. The Council finds that it is imperative that  such
  development results in water borne commuter services facilities that are
  accessible to all persons.
