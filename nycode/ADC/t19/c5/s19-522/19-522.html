Section 19-522

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  19-522  Group riding. The commission shall institute a group riding
  plan for the taxi industry in the city of New York. Initially, this plan
  shall encompass, minimally, a pilot group riding program  from  John  F.
  Kennedy  international  airport  to  any  and  all  points  in  the five
  boroughs, providing dispatchers at the various airport terminals  and  a
  central dispatching system to expedite passenger conveyance. After sixty
  days  from  the  start  of such program at John F. Kennedy international
  airport, the commission shall seek to establish group riding programs at
  various points in the five boroughs, to be designated by the commission,
  with the view  to  increasing  taxicab  availability  to  and  from  the
  outlying  sections  of  the  city  to  meet the maximum demands for taxi
  service.
