Section 19-506.1

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  19-506.1 Administrative Tribunal. a. If the commission is unable to
  produce a complaining witness in person, where such witness' credibility
  is relevant to  the  charges  made  in  the  notice  of  violation,  the
  commission  shall make reasonable efforts to make such witness available
  during the hearing by  videoconferencing  or  teleconferencing.  If  the
  complaining  witness  is  not available during a hearing, the commission
  shall produce a statement outlining its efforts to produce such witness.
  An administrative law judge shall examine such statement and  if  he  or
  she  decides the commission's efforts to produce the complaining witness
  were inadequate, the administrative law judge shall dismiss  the  notice
  of violation.
    b.  Hearings where the commission seeks the revocation of a commission
  issued license for a rule  violation  that  does  not  provide  for  the
  mandatory  revocation  of  such  license as a penalty shall be conducted
  before the office of administrative trials and  hearings  and  shall  be
  subject to the procedures of that tribunal. The commission may authorize
  other  hearings  to  be  conducted  before  the office of administrative
  trials and hearings.
    c.  If  a  respondent  timely  files  to  appeal  a  decision  of  the
  administrative   tribunal,  any  fines  imposed  by  the  administrative
  tribunal shall be stayed until  a  decision  is  made  in  such  appeal,
  provided  that  the commission shall not be required to refund any fines
  paid before respondent made his or her  appeal  unless  such  appeal  is
  successful.  The  administrative  tribunal  shall  expedite  any  appeal
  involving a suspension or revocation of a commission issued license.
    d. If, for the purposes of appealing a decision, a respondent requests
  a copy of the hearing recording, such recording  shall  be  produced  to
  such  respondent  within  thirty days after receipt of a written request
  from such respondent. If the commission  cannot  produce  the  recording
  within  the thirty day period, the determination being appealed shall be
  dismissed without prejudice.
    e. Notwithstanding any other  laws,  rules  or  regulations,  where  a
  respondent fails to appear at a scheduled hearing, such respondent shall
  have  two  years  from  the entry of any determination to move to vacate
  such determination and seek a new hearing. After  mailing  a  notice  of
  default   to  a  respondent,  the  commission  shall  prepare  a  record
  containing the name of the person who mailed such notice, and the  date,
  time and method used to mail such notice. The commission shall make such
  record available upon request to such respondent.
