Section 19-511.1

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  19-511.1  Council  review.  Any  determination by the commission to
  approve an application for a license to operate a new base station or to
  renew a license to operate a base station shall be subject to review  by
  the  council.  Within  ninety days of the first stated meeting following
  receipt of  such  determination  and  its  accompanying  materials,  the
  council may approve or disapprove such determination by local law, after
  having  adopted  a resolution to review that determination. In the event
  that the council fails to act by local law within the ninety day  period
  provided  for in this section, the determination of the commission shall
  remain in effect. Where a base station license  would  otherwise  expire
  while  a  determination  by  the commission to approve a renewal of such
  license is pending before the council, such license shall remain in full
  force and effect, unless suspended or revoked by the  commission,  until
  either   the   council  has  passed  a  local  law  to  disapprove  such
  determination or the  period  within  which  the  council  may  act  has
  elapsed.
