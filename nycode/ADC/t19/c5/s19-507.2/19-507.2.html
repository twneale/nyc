Section 19-507.2

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 19-507.2 Critical driver program. a. Any taxicab or for-hire vehicle
  driver  who  has  been  found guilty of violations such that six or more
  points have been assessed by the department  of  motor  vehicles  or  an
  equivalent  licensing  agency of the driver's state of residence against
  the driver license issued to such taxicab  or  for-hire  vehicle  driver
  within  any  fifteen-month  period and whose taxicab or for-hire vehicle
  driver's license has not been revoked shall have his or her  taxicab  or
  for-hire  vehicle  driver's  license  suspended  for  thirty  days.  The
  provisions of this subdivision shall apply only to violations issued  on
  or after February 15, 1999.
    b. Any taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver who has been found guilty of
  violations  such  that  ten  or  more  points  have been assessed by the
  department of motor vehicles or an equivalent licensing  agency  of  the
  driver's  state  of  residence against the driver license issued to such
  taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver within any fifteen-month period shall
  have his or her taxicab or for-hire vehicle  driver's  license  revoked.
  The provisions of this subdivision shall apply only to violations issued
  on or after February 15, 1999.
    c.  (1)  On  or after September 1, 1999, a taxicab or for-hire vehicle
  driver shall be eligible to receive a two point reduction in the  number
  of  points  assessed  pursuant  to  the critical driver program upon the
  submission to the commission of proof of the satisfactory completion  of
  a motor vehicle accident prevention course approved by the department of
  motor  vehicles.  Such  point reduction shall be considered in computing
  the total number of points accumulated by such driver  as  a  result  of
  violations which occurred within fifteen months prior to the date of the
  completion of the course.
    (2)   Notwithstanding   the   provisions  of  paragraph  one  of  this
  subdivision no point reduction shall affect any suspension or revocation
  action which may be taken by the commission  pursuant  to  this  program
  prior  to  the completion of the course. No person shall receive a point
  reduction more than once in any eighteen  month  period  and  no  person
  shall  receive  a  point  reduction  unless  attendance at the course is
  voluntary on the part of the driver.
    (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs one and two  of  this
  subdivision,  any  taxicab  or  for-hire  vehicle driver who voluntarily
  attends  and  satisfactorily  completes  one  motor   vehicle   accident
  prevention  course  approved by the department of motor vehicles between
  the effective date of this local law and August 31, 1999, shall have two
  points deducted from the total number of points assessed pursuant to the
  critical driver program against his or her taxicab or  for-hire  vehicle
  driver's  license.  No  point  reduction  shall affect any suspension or
  revocation action which may be taken by the commission pursuant to  this
  program prior to the completion of the course.
