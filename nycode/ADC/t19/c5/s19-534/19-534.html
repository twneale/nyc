Section 19-534

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  19-534  Clean air and accessible taxicab and for-hire vehicle plan.
  a.  Definitions. For the purposes of this section  only,  the  following
  terms shall have the following meanings:
    (1)  "Accessible  vehicle"  shall mean any taxicab or for-hire vehicle
  approved for use by the commission as a taxicab or for-hire vehicle that
  meets  the  specifications  and  requirements  for  accessible  vehicles
  pursuant to the americans with disabilities act of 1990, as amended, and
  rules promulgated by the commission.
    (2)  "Clean  air  vehicle"  shall mean any taxicab or for-hire vehicle
  approved for use by the commission that receives an air pollution  score
  of  9.5 or higher from the United States environmental protection agency
  or its successor agency and is estimated to emit 5.0  tons  or  less  of
  equivalent  carbon  dioxide  per year by the United States department of
  energy or its successor agency; provided that such vehicle is powered by
  the fuel for which such vehicle meets the above-specified standards.  In
  the  event  the  test  method  used  by  the United States environmental
  protection agency or its successor agency for determining  fuel  economy
  is  adjusted in a way that impacts United States department of energy or
  its successor agency estimates of equivalent  carbon  dioxide  emissions
  for  motor vehicles, the commission shall, for vehicles that fall within
  the affected model years, modify by rule the equivalent  carbon  dioxide
  emissions  estimate  included herein so as to appropriately reflect such
  adjustment's impact consistent with the intent of this section.
    b. No later than one hundred eighty days after the effective  date  of
  this  section,  the  commission  shall  develop  and  approve  a plan to
  significantly increase the number of clean air and  accessible  vehicles
  in New York city. Such plan shall include, but not be limited to:
    (1)  a description of specific measures the commission will implement,
  or recommend to the mayor and the  council  for  implementation  through
  local  law,  to increase the number of clean air and accessible vehicles
  and periodic goals for achieving such increases;
    (2)  a  schedule,  including  interim  and   final   milestones,   for
  implementing such measures; and
    (3)  an education campaign regarding clean air and accessible vehicles
  that provides taxicab and for-hire vehicle owners and prospective owners
  with information regarding the  availability,  costs  and  savings,  and
  benefits of such vehicles for such owners. Such information may include,
  but  is  not limited to: (i) for available clean air vehicle models: the
  fuel economy of such vehicles, as compared with other  models  typically
  used  as  taxicabs  and  for-hire  vehicles  in New York city; costs and
  savings associated with the purchase  and  use  of  such  vehicles;  the
  estimated air quality benefits associated with the use of such vehicles;
  and  any  available  governmental  and  manufacturer  incentives for the
  purchase of such vehicles; and (ii)  for  available  accessible  vehicle
  models:  the  fact  that  such  vehicles  can  be used to serve specific
  clients that non-accessible vehicles cannot  serve;  costs  and  savings
  associated  with  the  purchase  of  such  vehicles;  and  any available
  governmental and  manufacturer  incentives  for  the  purchase  of  such
  vehicles.  Such  information shall be posted on the commission's website
  and shall be provided to owners of taxicabs and for-hire  vehicles  upon
  issuance  or  renewal  of a license in accordance with section 19-504 of
  this chapter; by sending such information directly to such  owners  with
  other  commission  documents and notices; during informational workshops
  open to  all  commission  licensees;  or  in  any  other  manner  deemed
  appropriate by the commission.
    c.  The  commission  shall  implement  the plan developed and approved
  pursuant to subdivision b of this section.

    d. The commission  shall  conduct  or  participate  in  at  least  one
  informational  workshop  regarding  clean air and accessible vehicles in
  each of the two calendar years following the development and approval of
  the plan pursuant to subdivision b of this section.
    e.  The  commission shall in every annual report submitted to the city
  council pursuant to section twenty three hundred two  of  the  New  York
  city  charter, include the following information: (i) the implementation
  status of the measures included  in  the  plan  developed  and  approved
  pursuant  to  this section; (ii) the numbers of clean air and accessible
  vehicles in New York city, disaggregated by vehicle model, and how  such
  numbers  compare  to  those  of the previous year and with the goals set
  forth in such plan; and (iii) to the extent practicable,  the  estimated
  air  quality  benefits  and fuel savings associated with the use of each
  clean air vehicle model in operation as a taxicab or for-hire vehicle in
  New York city and the aggregate air quality benefits  and  fuel  savings
  associated with the use of all such vehicles.
    f.  The  commission  shall establish a web page or pages or modify its
  existing website to make available information regarding clean  air  and
  accessible  vehicles,  which  shall  include, but not be limited to, the
  information provided pursuant to paragraph three  of  subdivision  b  of
  this section and the numbers of clean air and accessible vehicles in New
  York  city, disaggregated by vehicle model, which shall be updated, at a
  minimum, every four months.
    g. The commission shall  annually  review  the  plan  required  to  be
  implemented  pursuant  to  subdivision  c  of this section to determine,
  among other things, whether such plan has helped to increase the  number
  of  clean  air  and accessible vehicles and whether scheduled milestones
  and goals included in such plan have  been  met.  The  commission  shall
  revise such plan as necessary to accomplish such goals.
