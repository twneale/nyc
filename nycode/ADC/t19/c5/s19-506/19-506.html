Section 19-506

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  19-506  Regulations  and  enforcement.    a.  Except as provided by
  section 19-512.1, the commission  may  impose  reasonable  fines  and/or
  suspend  or revoke any license issued by the commission where the holder
  has failed to comply with or has willfully or knowingly violated any  of
  the provisions of this chapter or a rule or regulation of the commission
  after  adjudication  of  such  violation  by the administrative tribunal
  established by the commission in accordance with section 2303 of the New
  York city charter.
    b. 1. Except as provided in  paragraph  2  of  this  subdivision,  any
  person  who  shall  permit  another  to  operate  or who shall knowingly
  operate or offer to operate for hire any vehicle as  a  taxicab,  coach,
  wheelchair accessible van, HAIL vehicle or for-hire vehicle in the city,
  without  first  having  obtained  or knowing that another has obtained a
  license for such vehicle pursuant to the provisions of section 19-504 of
  this chapter, shall be guilty of a violation, and upon conviction in the
  criminal court shall be punished by a fine of not less than one thousand
  dollars or more than two thousand dollars or imprisonment for  not  more
  than  sixty  days,  or  both  such fine and imprisonment. This paragraph
  shall apply to the owner of such  vehicle  and,  if  different,  to  the
  operator of such vehicle.
    2.  Any  person  who  shall  permit  another  to  operate or who shall
  knowingly operate or offer to operate for hire any vehicle licensed as a
  taxicab, coach, wheelchair accessible  van,  HAIL  vehicle  or  for-hire
  vehicle  in  the  city  in  a  manner  that  is  beyond the scope of the
  activities permitted by such vehicle's license  shall  be  guilty  of  a
  violation,  and  upon conviction in the criminal court shall be punished
  by a fine of not less than  four  hundred  dollars  nor  more  than  one
  thousand  dollars,  or imprisonment for not more than sixty days or both
  such fine and imprisonment. This paragraph shall apply to the  owner  of
  such vehicle and, if different, to the operator of such vehicle.
    3.  Where  a  violation  of  this  chapter  or  any  rules promulgated
  thereunder is committed using a vehicle  which  is  owned  by  a  rental
  vehicle  company  and  has  been rented or leased by such rental vehicle
  company, it shall be an affirmative  defense  that  the  rental  vehicle
  company  did not know or have any reason to know that the person to whom
  it was rented or leased would operate or offer to operate for hire  such
  vehicle  as  a  taxicab,  coach,  wheelchair  accessible van or for-hire
  vehicle in the city. For purposes of this subdivision, a "rental vehicle
  company"  shall  be  defined  as  any  person  or  organization  or  any
  subsidiary  or  affiliate,  including  a  franchise,  in the business of
  providing rental vehicles to the public.
    c. (1) No person shall operate or permit to be  operated  any  vehicle
  bearing  the  words "hack," "taxi," "taxicab," "cab," "coach," "for-hire
  vehicle," "livery," "limousine," "commuter van service," "van  service,"
  "commuter  van," "van" or other designation of similar import unless the
  vehicle is licensed as a taxicab, coach, for-hire vehicle,  or  commuter
  van,  as appropriate, and the driver has an appropriate driver's license
  under this chapter, and in the case of  a  commuter  van  service,  such
  person has an authorization to operate a commuter van service, nor shall
  any person advertise or hold himself or herself out as doing business as
  a  taxi, taxicab, hack or coach service unless he or she holds a vehicle
  license and medallion for each vehicle  used  therefor,  nor  shall  any
  person  advertise  or hold himself or herself out as doing business as a
  "limousine service," "livery service," a "for-hire vehicle service,"  or
  other similar designation unless a for-hire vehicle license is in effect
  for  each  vehicle used therefor, nor shall any person advertise or hold
  himself or herself out as doing business as a  "commuter  van  service,"
  "van  service,"  "commuter  van,"  "van" or other designation of similar

  import unless such person  is  authorized  to  operate  a  commuter  van
  service  and  a  commuter van license is in effect for each vehicle used
  therefor as required by this chapter, nor shall any person advertise  or
  hold himself or herself out as doing business as a wheelchair accessible
  van  service or other similar designation unless a wheelchair accessible
  van license is in effect for each vehicle used therefor.
    (2) Any person required to obtain a license under this  chapter  shall
  conspicuously state in all print and broadcast advertising, with respect
  to  such  licensed  activity,  the  vehicle  license number and that the
  activity is licensed by  the  commission;  provided,  however,  that  as
  applied  to  the owner of a for-hire vehicle base station, or wheelchair
  accessible van base station, such license number shall be the number  of
  the  license  issued  to  such  base station; provided further, that the
  requirement of  this  subdivision  respecting  the  display  of  vehicle
  license  numbers  in  print and broadcast advertising shall not apply to
  any owner of five or more taxicabs. No person who is required to  obtain
  authorization to operate a commuter van service under this chapter shall
  advertise  in  print  or  in  a  broadcast medium the activity for which
  authorization  is  required  without  conspicuously  stating   in   such
  advertising  the  commuter van service authorization number and that the
  activity is licensed by the commission.
    d. Any person, other than a person holding a driver's  license  issued
  pursuant  to  section  19-505  and  a  New York state class A, B, C or E
  license, neither of  which  is  revoked  or  suspended,  who  drives  or
  operates  for hire a licensed vehicle in the city except a commuter van,
  shall be guilty of a violation, and  upon  conviction  in  the  criminal
  court, shall be punished by a fine of not less than five hundred dollars
  nor  more  than  one  thousand  dollars  or  imprisonment for a term not
  exceeding thirty days, or both such fine and imprisonment.
    e. (1) In addition to or as an alternative to the  penalties  provided
  for the violation of the provisions of paragraph one of subdivision b or
  subdivision  d  of  this  section,  any  person  who  shall violate such
  provisions shall, for the first violation, be liable for a civil penalty
  of one thousand five hundred  dollars,  and  for  the  second  violation
  committed  within  a thirty six month period, for a civil penalty of two
  thousand dollars.
    (2) As an alternative to the penalties provided for the  violation  of
  the  provisions  of  paragraph  two of subdivision b or subdivision c of
  this section, any person who shall  violate  such  provisions  shall  be
  liable for a civil penalty of not less than two hundred dollars nor more
  than one thousand five hundred dollars for each violation.
    (3)  A  proceeding  to impose a civil penalty prescribed in paragraphs
  one or two of this subdivision or in subdivision f of this section shall
  be commenced by the service of a notice of violation  returnable  before
  the  commission  or  an  administrative  tribunal of the commission. The
  commission or such tribunal, after a hearing as provided by the rules of
  the commission or its successor agency, shall have the power to  enforce
  its  decisions  and orders imposing such civil penalties as if they were
  money judgments pursuant to subdivision c of section two thousand  three
  hundred three of the charter.
    f.  As  an  alternative to the penalties provided for the violation of
  subdivision c of this section, the commission, after notice and hearing,
  shall be authorized to impose  the  civil  penalties  provided  in  this
  subdivision  upon  any  person found to have advertised in print or in a
  broadcast medium in violation of such  subdivision,  provided,  however,
  that  such  civil penalties may be imposed only when such person was not
  licensed by the commission at the time of such violation. Such penalties
  shall be levied for each broadcast in violation of such subdivision  and

  shall  be  not  less than one hundred dollars nor more than five hundred
  fifty dollars for  each  such  broadcast.  Such  penalties  for  printed
  advertisements  shall  be  levied  for  each  publication  and  shall be
  determined  based  on  the  period  of time the publication in which the
  advertisement appears remains  current.  The  current  period  shall  be
  determined as that time when a publication is initially offered for sale
  or  distribution  until  the  period  when the next dated publication is
  offered for sale or distribution. In no case shall this period  be  less
  than twenty-four hours. If the current period is:
    daily,  such  penalty  shall  be not less than one hundred dollars nor
  more than five hundred dollars per day;
    weekly, such penalty shall be not less than two hundred fifty  dollars
  nor more than seven hundred fifty dollars;
    greater  than one week and not more than one month, such penalty shall
  be not less than seven hundred fifty dollars nor more than one  thousand
  dollars; and
    greater  than  one  month,  such  penalty  shall  be not less than one
  thousand dollars nor more than two thousand dollars.
    g. The commission shall undertake a public awareness campaign advising
  the public to patronize only licensed  taxicabs  and  for-hire  vehicles
  and, when selecting a taxicab or for-hire vehicle from an advertisement,
  to look for the commission license number in any such advertisement.
    h.  (1)  Any  officer  or employee of the commission designated by the
  chairperson of the commission and  any  police  officer  may  seize  any
  vehicle  which  he  or  she has probable cause to believe is operated or
  offered to be  operated  without  a  vehicle  license  in  violation  of
  paragraph one of subdivision b of this section or without an appropriate
  vehicle  license  for  such  operation  in violation of paragraph two of
  subdivision b or of subdivision c or  subdivision  k  of  this  section.
  Therefore,  either  the  commission or an administrative tribunal of the
  commission at a proceeding commenced in accordance with subdivision e of
  this section, or the criminal court, as provided in this section,  shall
  determine  whether  a  vehicle  seized  pursuant to this subdivision was
  operated or offered to be operated in violation of any such subdivision.
  The commission shall have the power to promulgate regulations concerning
  the seizure and release of vehicles and may provide in such  regulations
  for reasonable fees for the removal and storage of such vehicles. Unless
  the  charge  of  violating  subdivision  b,  c  or  k of this section is
  dismissed, no vehicle seized  pursuant  to  this  subdivision  shall  be
  released  until all fees for removal and storage and the applicable fine
  or civil penalty have been paid or a bond has been posted in a form  and
  amount  satisfactory  to the commission, except as is otherwise provided
  for vehicles subject to forfeiture pursuant to  paragraph  two  of  this
  subdivision.
    (2)  In  addition  to any other penalties provided in this section, if
  the owner is convicted in the criminal court  of,  or  found  liable  in
  accordance  with  subdivision  e  of  this  section  for, a violation of
  paragraphs  one  or  two  of  subdivision  b  or  of  subdivision  c  or
  subdivision  k  of  this  section  two  or  more  times, and all of such
  violations were committed on or after the effective date of this section
  and within a thirty-six month period, the interest of such owner in  any
  vehicle  used  in  the  commission  of  any  such  second  or subsequent
  violation shall be  subject  to  forfeiture  upon  notice  and  judicial
  determination.  Notice  of  the institution of the forfeiture proceeding
  shall be in accordance with the provisions of the civil practice law and
  rules. The penalties provided for in this paragraph shall also apply  to
  any owner who has been convicted of or found liable for one violation of
  paragraphs  one  or  two  of  subdivision  b  or  of  subdivision  c  or

  subdivision k of this section at the time the local law that added  this
  paragraph   was   enacted  and  who  commits  another  violation  within
  thirty-six months of the first violation.
    (3)  Except as hereinafter provided, the city agency having custody of
  a vehicle after judicial determination of forfeiture, shall,  no  sooner
  than  thirty days after such determination and upon a notice of at least
  five days, sell such forfeited vehicle at public sale. Any person, other
  than an owner whose interest is forfeited pursuant to this section,  who
  establishes  a  right  of  ownership  in  a  vehicle,  including  a part
  ownership or security interest, shall be  entitle  to  delivery  of  the
  vehicle if such person;
    (A)  redeems the ownership interest which was subject to forfeiture by
  payment to the city of the value thereof;
    (B) pays the reasonable expenses of the  safekeeping  of  the  vehicle
  between the time of seizure and such redemption; and
    (C)  either  (i) asserts a claim in the forfeiture proceeding, or (ii)
  submits a claim in writing to the commission within  thirty  days  after
  judicial determination of forfeiture.
    (4)   Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  paragraph  three  of  this
  subdivision, establishment of a right of ownership shall not  entitle  a
  person  to  delivery  of  a  vehicle  if  the  city  establishes  in the
  forfeiture proceeding or in a separate administrative adjudication of  a
  claim  asserted  pursuant to subparagraph (C) of paragraph three of this
  subdivision that the violations of subdivision b, c or k of this section
  upon which the forfeiture is  predicated  were  expressly  or  impliedly
  permitted  by  such  person.  The  commission  or successor agency shall
  promulgate rules and regulations setting forth the procedure for such an
  administrative  adjudication,  which  shall  include  provision  for   a
  hearing.
    (5)  For  purposes of this subdivision, the term "owner" shall mean an
  owner as defined in section one hundred twenty-eight and in  subdivision
  three  of  section three hundred eighty-eight of the vehicle and traffic
  law.
    (6) The provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to the  seizure
  and  forfeiture  of  commuter  vans  which shall be governed by sections
  19-529.2 and 19-529.3 of this chapter.
    i. (1) Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of this chapter, any
  person  who  violates  any  provision  of  this  chapter  or  any   rule
  promulgated hereunder applicable to commuter van services, commuter vans
  or  drivers  of  commuter vans shall be subject to a civil penalty in an
  amount  to  be  prescribed  by  the  commission  by  rule  for  specific
  violations  which  amount  shall  not  exceed one thousand dollars for a
  first violation  and  twenty-five  hundred  dollars  for  a  second  and
  subsequent  violation  committed  within two years of a first violation.
  Where such violation involves the operation of a  commuter  van  service
  without  the  authorization required by this chapter, the operation of a
  commuter van without  the  license  required  by  this  chapter  or  the
  operation  of  a  commuter  van that is not pursuant to a current, valid
  authorization to operate a commuter van service, such  person  shall  be
  liable for a civil penalty of not less than five hundred dollars and not
  more than one thousand dollars, and for a subsequent violation committed
  within two years of the first violation, such person shall be liable for
  a  civil penalty of not less than one thousand dollars and not more than
  twenty-five hundred dollars.
    (2) A proceeding to impose such civil penalty shall  be  commenced  by
  the service of a notice of violation returnable before the commission or
  an administrative tribunal of the commission. Such civil penalties shall

  be  imposed  after  a  hearing  in  accordance  with  the  rules  of the
  commission.
    (3)   Except   as   otherwise  provided  in  paragraph  four  of  this
  subdivision, civil penalties imposed by the commission or such  tribunal
  may  be  recovered  by  the corporation counsel in a civil action in any
  court of competent jurisdiction.
    (4) Decisions and orders of the commission or such  tribunal  imposing
  civil penalties for violations relating to the operation of commuter van
  service  without  authorization and the operation of unlicensed commuter
  vans and unlicensed drivers of commuter vans may be entered and enforced
  as if they were money judgments of a court pursuant to subdivision c  of
  section two thousand three hundred three of the charter.
    (5)  Notices  of  violation  which are returnable to the commission or
  such tribunal may be served by any officers or employees  designated  by
  the  commission,  any  police  officer  or  any  authorized  officers or
  employees of the department of  transportation  or  the  New  York  city
  transit authority.
    j.  Where  the  commission or administrative tribunal thereof finds an
  owner liable for operating a  vehicle  as  a  commuter  van  without  an
  authorization  to  operate  a commuter van service or without a commuter
  van license, the commission shall notify the New York state commissioner
  of motor vehicles pursuant  to  subparagraph  four  of  paragraph  a  of
  subdivision  five of section eighty of the New York state transportation
  law of such finding. Upon such notification, the commissioner  of  motor
  vehicles,  pursuant  to  such subparagraph four, shall thereupon suspend
  the registration of such vehicle and shall deny any application for  the
  registration  of such vehicle or any application for the renewal thereof
  pursuant to subdivision five-a  of  section  four  hundred  one  of  the
  vehicle  and  traffic  law  until  such  time as the commission may give
  notice that the  violation  has  been  corrected  to  its  satisfaction.
  Operation  of  any  motor  vehicle  for  which the registration has been
  suspended as herein provided shall constitute a class A misdemeanor. The
  commission shall also notify the department of finance where it finds an
  owner liable for operating a  vehicle  as  a  commuter  van  without  an
  authorization  to  operate  a commuter van service or without a commuter
  van license.
    k. No driver of any vehicle with a valid HAIL license shall  accept  a
  passenger  by  street  hail  within the city of New York from a location
  where street hails by such vehicles are not permitted.
    (i) A violation of this subdivision shall be punishable by a  fine  of
  five  hundred  dollars  for  the  first  violation.  A violation of this
  subdivision shall be punishable by a fine of seven hundred fifty dollars
  when a driver has been convicted of  a  violation  of  this  subdivision
  within the immediately preceding twenty-four months. A violation of this
  subdivision  shall  result  in revocation of the driver's license issued
  pursuant to paragraphs (i) and (iii) of subdivision a of section  19-505
  of  this  chapter  when  such violation is committed by a driver who has
  previously been convicted of two violations of this section  within  the
  immediately preceding one hundred twenty months.
    (ii)  A  finding  that  a  driver  has  committed  a violation of this
  subdivision shall be evidence that the owner  or  operator  holding  the
  HAIL  license  with  respect  to the vehicle in which such violation was
  committed failed to make a reasonable good faith  effort  to  deter  the
  commission  of  such  violation.  A  driver's  third  conviction of this
  subdivision within one hundred twenty months shall result in  revocation
  of  a  HAIL license if each such violation occurred in a vehicle subject
  to a HAIL license held by such owner or operator of one or more of  such
  HAIL  licenses.  The  New  York  city  taxi  and limousine commission or

  successor agency shall advise such owner or operator  holding  the  HAIL
  license  of his or her potential liability pursuant to this section upon
  a finding that a violation of paragraph  (i)  of  this  subdivision  was
  committed in a vehicle with a valid HAIL license.
    l.  A  person  is  guilty of unlawful fleeing a New York city taxi and
  limousine enforcement officer or police officer when, knowing that he or
  she has been directed to remain stopped by a  New  York  city  taxi  and
  limousine enforcement officer or police officer, the driver of a vehicle
  operating  pursuant  to a HAIL license who is stopped in a zone where he
  or she is not permitted to pick up street hails thereafter  attempts  to
  flee  such  officer  by setting the vehicle in motion and either travels
  over  three  hundred  feet  without  stopping  or  engages  in   conduct
  constituting  reckless  driving  as  defined  in  section twelve hundred
  twelve of the vehicle and traffic law. Unlawful fleeing a New York  city
  taxi   and   limousine  enforcement  officer  or  police  officer  is  a
  misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not less than  seven  hundred  fifty
  dollars  nor  more  than one thousand dollars, or by imprisonment of not
  more  than  ninety  days  or  by  both  such  fine   and   imprisonment.
  Notwithstanding  any  contrary  provision  of law, any charge alleging a
  violation of this subdivision shall be returnable before a court  having
  jurisdiction over misdemeanors.
    m.  On or before February 1, 2013 and on a quarterly basis thereafter,
  the commission shall post on its website and provide to  the  council  a
  report  for the prior quarter that includes, at a minimum, the following
  information, subject to the manner that such data is available: (i)  the
  number  of  criminal  actions  commenced  pursuant  to  paragraph one of
  subdivision b of this section;  (ii)  the  number  of  criminal  actions
  commenced  pursuant  to  paragraph two of subdivision b of this section;
  (iii) the number of civil actions commenced pursuant to paragraph one of
  subdivision e  of  this  section;  (iv)  the  number  of  civil  actions
  commenced  pursuant  to  paragraph two of subdivision e of this section;
  and (v) the number of vehicles  seized  pursuant  to  paragraph  one  of
  subdivision h of this section, disaggregated by whether such vehicle was
  seized  for a violation of paragraph one or two of subdivision b of this
  section.  Such  report  shall  also  be  disaggregated  by  borough  and
  precinct.
