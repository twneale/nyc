    &sect;  19-516  Acceptance  of passengers by for-hire vehicles and commuter
  vans. a. For-hire vehicles that do not possess a valid HAIL license  may
  accept   passengers   only   on  the  basis  of  telephone  contract  or
  prearrangement. The commission or successor agency  may  establish  such
  disciplinary actions as it deems appropriate for failure to abide by the
  provisions of this chapter.
    b.  No commuter van service and no person who owns, operates or drives
  a commuter van, shall provide, permit  or  authorize  the  provision  of
  transportation service to a passenger unless such service to a passenger
  is on the basis of a telephone contract or other prearrangement and such
  prearrangement  is  evidenced  by  such  records  as are required by the
  commission to be maintained. Where a violation of this  subdivision  has
  been  committed  by a driver of a commuter van, the commuter van service
  and the owner of such vehicle shall also be liable for  a  violation  of
  this subdivision.
