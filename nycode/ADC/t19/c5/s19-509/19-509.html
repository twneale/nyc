Section 19-509

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  19-509 Licensing of taximeter business. a. It shall be unlawful for
  any  person  to  engage  in  the  business  of  manufacturing,  selling,
  repairing and adjusting or calibrating taximeters or taximeter equipment
  for  use  upon  any  licensed vehicle in the city unless he or she shall
  secure a license therefor from the commission, and such  person  engaged
  in  the  business  of  installing,  repairing,  adjusting or calibrating
  taximeters shall only be licensed if he shall have a place  of  business
  within  the  city  large  enough  simultaneously to accommodate at least
  three vehicles. Such licenses shall be issued for a period not exceeding
  one year and shall expire on the thirty-first day of March following the
  date of issue. The fee for the issuance of each such  license  shall  be
  five  hundred  dollars  per  annum  for  each place of business licensed
  provided, however, that upon the issuance of a license for a  period  of
  six  months  or  less, the fee shall be one-half the annual fee fixed by
  the commission.
    b. It shall be unlawful for  such  person  to  sell  or  attach  to  a
  licensed  vehicle  for  use  within  the city a taximeter which does not
  comply with the rules and regulations established by the commission, and
  the commission may establish such rules and regulations  in  respect  to
  the   taximeter  business  as  may  be  reasonable  to  assure  adequate
  protection of the public and enforcement of the provisions and  purposes
  of this chapter and may require such reports and other information as it
  deems  necessary  or  advisable.  Any  person who shall install, repair,
  adjust or calibrate any taximeter shall securely affix to the inside  of
  the  glass window thereon, so as to be clearly legible from the outside,
  a printed poster bearing his or her license number.
    c. Fees to be charged by persons licensed  pursuant  to  this  section
  shall  be  subject to approval of the commission. In determining whether
  any proposed fee or fee schedules  shall  be  approved,  the  commission
  shall  take  into consideration the nature of the service performed, the
  costs of the licensee, a reasonable profit to  the  licensee,  fees  for
  similar  services  charged  in other communities, and the welfare of the
  taxicab and taximeter industries.
