  shall fine any driver, or suspend or revoke the driver's license of  any
  driver,  as  provided  in  subdivision b of this section, who shall have
  been found in violation of any of the following:
    1. No driver of a taxicab shall seek to ascertain, without justifiable
  grounds, the destination of a passenger before such passenger  shall  be

    2.  No  driver of a taxicab shall refuse, without justifiable grounds,
  to take any passenger or prospective passenger to any destination within

    3. No driver of a vehicle the fares of which are set by the commission

  fare set by the commission or successor agency.
    4.  No  driver  of a for-hire vehicle, other than a driver operating a
  for-hire vehicle with a valid  HAIL  license,  shall  accept  passengers
  unless  the  passengers  have engaged the use of the for-hire vehicle on
  the basis of telephone contract or prearrangement.
    b. 1. Any driver who has been found to have violated  a  provision  of
  paragraph  one,  two  or  three of subdivision a of this section, or any
  combination thereof, shall be fined not less than  two  hundred  dollars
  nor more than five hundred dollars for the first offense. Any driver who
  has been found in violation of any of the provisions of such paragraphs,
  or any combination thereof, for a second time within a twenty-four month
  period shall be fined not less than three hundred fifty dollars nor more
  than  one  thousand dollars, and the commission may suspend the driver's
  license of such driver for a period  not  to  exceed  thirty  days.  Any
  driver  who  has  been  found  to have violated any of the provisions of
  paragraph one, two or three of  such  subdivision,  or  any  combination
  thereof,  three  or more times within a thirty-six month period shall be
  fined not more  than  one  thousand  dollars  for  each  such  third  or
  subsequent offense, and the commission shall revoke the driver's license
  of  such  driver.  Any driver who has been found to have violated any of
  the provisions of paragraph four of subdivision a of this section  shall
  be  fined  not less than two hundred dollars nor more than three hundred
  fifty dollars for the first offense. Any driver who has  been  found  in
  violation  of  any of the provisions of such paragraph for a second time
  within a twenty-four month period shall be fined  not  less  than  three
  hundred  fifty  dollars  nor  more  than  five  hundred dollars, and the
  commission may suspend the driver's license of such driver for a  period
  not  to  exceed  thirty  days.  The commission shall revoke the driver's
  license of any driver who has been found to have  violated  any  of  the
  provisions  of  paragraph  four  of such subdivision three or more times
  within a thirty-six month period.
    2.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of   paragraph   one   of   this
  subdivision,  the  commission  shall  revoke the driver's license of any
  person found to have violated paragraph three of subdivision a  of  this
  section  by  charging  or  attempting to charge a fare of ten dollars or
  more above the approved rate of fare for taxicabs.
    3. Any driver or vehicle owner of a vehicle licensed by the commission
  or base station licensee who facilitates sex trafficking with a  vehicle
  shall  be  liable  for  a civil penalty of ten thousand dollars, and the
  commission shall revoke the license of such driver, the license  of  the
  vehicle used to commit such facilitation when the person who facilitated
  sex  trafficking  is  the  owner of such vehicle, and the license of the
  base station licensee when such base  station  licensee  committed  such
  facilitation  and  the  vehicle  used  to  commit  such facilitation was
  affiliated with the base station licensed by such licensee at  the  time
  such offense was committed.

    c.  The  commission  shall not issue any license under this chapter to
  any person who has had his or her driver's license revoked  pursuant  to
  subdivision  b  of  this  section prior to a period of one year from the
  date of such revocation.
    d.  1.  Each  owner  shall  make  a reasonable good faith effort, by a
  driver education program or other affirmative  measures,  to  deter  the
  commission of violations of paragraphs one, two and three of subdivision
  a  of  this  section by drivers of taxicabs for which such owner holds a
  vehicle license. A finding that a driver has committed  a  violation  of
  any  such paragraph shall create a rebuttable presumption that the owner
  holding the vehicle license for the taxicab in which such violation  was
  committed has failed to make a reasonable good faith effort to deter the
  commission  of such violation. In any proceeding for a violation of this
  paragraph, it is an affirmative defense that the owner made a reasonable
  good faith effort, by a driver education program  or  other  affirmative
  measures,  to  deter the commission of violations of paragraphs one, two
  and three of subdivision a of this section. The commission shall  advise
  an  owner  in writing of his or her potential liability pursuant to this
  subdivision upon a finding  that  a  violation  of  such  paragraph  was
  committed in a taxicab for which such owner holds a vehicle license.
    2. If the owner holding a vehicle license for a taxicab or taxicabs in
  which  a  driver or drivers have been found to have committed violations
  of paragraphs one, two or three of subdivision a of this section, or any
  combination thereof, is found not to have made a reasonable  good  faith
  effort  to  deter  such  violation,  the  owner  shall  be  liable for a
  violation of paragraph one of this subdivision as follows:
    (i) for the second violation  of  paragraphs  one,  two  or  three  of
  subdivision  a of this section, or any combination thereof, committed in
  a taxicab or taxicabs for which the owner holds  a  vehicle  license  or
  licenses, the commission shall fine the owner two hundred dollars;
    (ii)  for  the  third  violation  of  paragraphs  one, two or three of
  subdivision a of this section, or any combination thereof, committed  in
  a  taxicab  or  taxicabs  for which the owner holds a vehicle license or
  licenses, the commission shall fine the owner not less that two  hundred
  dollars nor more than three hundred fifty dollars;
    (iii)  for the fourth and each subsequent violation of paragraphs one,
  two or three of subdivision  a  of  this  section,  or  any  combination
  thereof,  committed in a taxicab or taxicabs for which the owner holds a
  vehicle license or licenses, the commission shall  fine  the  owner  not
  less than three hundred fifty nor more than five hundred dollars;
    (iv)  for  the  fifth and each subsequent violation of paragraphs one,
  two or three of subdivision  a  of  this  section,  or  any  combination
  thereof,  committed in a taxicab or taxicabs for which the owner holds a
  vehicle license or licenses, the commission shall  suspend  the  vehicle
  license  of  the  taxicab  used  in  the  commission  of the most recent
  violation for a period not to exceed sixty days.
    For purposes  of  this  paragraph,  the  obligation  to  have  made  a
  "reasonable  good  faith  effort"  shall  be  met if the owner, upon the
  hiring of each new driver and for all  drivers,  shall,  at  least  once
  annually,  distribute  a  copy  of  applicable  commission rules to each
  driver and obtains a written receipt  therefore.  The  commission  shall
  supply  owners  with  a  copy of all such applicable rules. In addition,
  such rules shall be conspicuously posted by the  owner  at  the  owner's
  place of business so that they are readily visible to all drivers.
    3. The commission shall promulgate rules and regulations setting forth
  the  procedure  for  an  administrative  adjudication  of  violations of
  paragraph one of this subdivision, which  shall  include  provision  for
  notice and a hearing.

    e.  The  term  "without justifiable ground" used in paragraphs one and
  two of subdivision a  of  this  section  shall  mean  that  standard  of
  behavior  which  fails  to  conform  to that of a reasonable and prudent
  person acting in compliance with  any  regulations  promulgated  by  the
  commission.
    f. The commission may suspend or revoke the license of any person whom
  it  determines  has obtained a license by fraud or false representation,
  or willful misstatement or omission of a material fact.
