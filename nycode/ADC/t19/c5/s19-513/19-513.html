Section 19-513

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 19-513 Repossessions. Any taxicab which is transferred involuntarily
  because  of  a  default  in  the  payment  or installments due under the
  contract of sale, or any other contract or in any other  manner  whereby
  the  license  holder's  interest in the license is not also transferred,
  and which is disposed according to law at public or private sale, may be
  operated by the purchaser thereof or his or her  vendee,  provided  such
  purchaser or vendee is acceptable to the commission as a person suitable
  to  receive  a  license.  Upon such involuntary transfer, the license of
  said  taxicab  shall  be  cancelled   immediately   and   a   temporary,
  nontransferable, nonrenewable license issued to such purchaser or vendee
  for  a  period  not  exceeding one year upon the payment of a fee of not
  exceeding one hundred dollars therefor. At the end  of  such  time,  the
  original  holder of the license, or his or her transferee if the license
  was first issued before the effective date of  this  chapter,  shall  be
  entitled  to  renewal  of  the  license, provided that the provisions of
  subdivision (a) of section 19-512 of this chapter are complied  with  by
  such  applicant,  whether  he  or  she  is  the  original  holder  or  a
  transferee.
