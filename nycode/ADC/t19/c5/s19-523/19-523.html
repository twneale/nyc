    c. The commission shall consider a broad range of service, pricing and
  regulatory  options  including,  but not limited to, imposing additional

  outside  of  the  central business district of the borough of Manhattan,
  establishing group  riding  programs  at  various  points  in  the  five
  boroughs,  instituting  double  shifting  and  shift  time  changes  for
  taxicabs,  altering  the  fare  structure  for  taxicabs  and  improving
  compliance   with   the  requirements  of  paragraphs  one  and  two  of
  subdivision a of section 19-507. The report to the council shall include
  a thorough assessment of each possible option for improving service, the
  commission's recommendations as to which options should  be  implemented
  and a timetable for implementing these options.
