Section 19-514

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  19-514  Color  schemes and emblems. a. The exterior of all taxicabs
  shall be painted yellow or any shade thereof.
    b. The name of the corporate owner shall be printed on both rear doors
  or on both front doors of each taxicab in such  a  manner  as  shall  be
  prescribed by the commission.
    c.  The  commission  may  grant to any taxicab owner or association of
  taxicab owners, upon proper application therefor, the exclusive right to
  use one or more distinctive emblems or other identifying designs  to  be
  displayed on the vehicles of such applicant.
    d.  Such  applications  must  include colored sketches of the proposed
  color schemes of the emblems or designs, together with  such  other  and
  further information as the commission may require.
    e.  An  owner  shall  not  use  an  emblem granted to another owner or
  association, an emblem so similar as to lead to confusion in the mind of
  the public, or an emblem granted to any association unless he or she  be
  a  member of said association. The commission may suspend the license of
  any owner violating the provisions hereof.
    f. Each taxicab license shall be  represented  by  a  metal  medallion
  which shall bear the license number and be affixed to the outside of the
  licensed  taxicab. The commission may require that a notice be posted at
  the main entrance of each garage housing taxicab vehicles  reciting  the
  number   of   such  vehicles,  their  license  numbers  and  such  other
  information as the commission may designate.
    g. Any vehicle for hire except those licensed under the provisions  of
  this  chapter  shall not bear the colors yellow, orange, or gold, or, in
  combination  of  yellow-white,  orange-white,  gold-white,  green-white,
  blue-white  or  any  other combination of the above said colors or color
  scheme or striping in said colors.
    h.  Any  accessible  taxicab  or  for-hire  vehicle  licensed  by  the
  commission  shall display the international wheelchair insignia or other
  insignia approved by the commission that identifies such vehicle  as  an
  accessible  vehicle,  in  a  minimum  of two prominent locations on such
  vehicle's  exterior.  For  purposes  of  this  subdivision,  "accessible
  vehicle"  shall mean any vehicle approved for use by the commission as a
  taxicab  or  for-hire  vehicle  that  meets   the   specifications   and
  requirements  for  accessible  vehicles  pursuant  to the americans with
  disabilities act of 1990, as  amended,  and  rules  promulgated  by  the
  commission.
    i.  Any clean air vehicle licensed by the commission shall display the
  words "CLEAN AIR VEHICLE" or such other term or symbol approved  by  the
  commission  that  identifies  such  vehicle  as a clean air vehicle in a
  minimum of two prominent locations on such vehicle's exterior.  For  the
  purposes of this subdivision, "clean air vehicle" shall mean any taxicab
  or  for-hire vehicle approved for use by the commission that receives an
  air  pollution  score  of  9.0  or  higher  from   the   United   States
  environmental protection agency or its successor agency and is estimated
  to  emit  6.4  tons or less of equivalent carbon dioxide per year by the
  United States department of energy or  its  successor  agency;  provided
  that  such  vehicle  is powered by the fuel for which such vehicle meets
  the above-specified standards. In the event the test method used by  the
  United  States  environmental  protection agency or its successor agency
  for determining fuel economy is adjusted in a way  that  impacts  United
  States  department  of  energy  or  its  successor  agency  estimates of
  equivalent carbon dioxide emissions for motor vehicles,  the  commission
  shall, for vehicles that fall within the affected model years, modify by
  rule the equivalent carbon dioxide emissions estimate included herein so
  as to appropriately reflect such adjustment's impact consistent with the
  intent of this section.
