Section 19-512.1

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  19-512.1  Revocation  of  taxicab,  for-hire  or  HAIL  license  or
  licenses.  a. The commission or successor agency  may,  for  good  cause
  shown  relating  to a direct and substantial threat to the public health
  or safety and prior to giving notice and an opportunity for  a  hearing,
  suspend  a  taxicab,  for-hire  vehicle license or a HAIL license issued
  pursuant to this chapter and, after notice  and  an  opportunity  for  a
  hearing,  suspend  or  revoke  such license. The commission or successor
  agency may also, without having suspended a  taxicab,  for-hire  vehicle
  license  or  a HAIL license, issue a determination to seek suspension or
  revocation of such license and after notice and  an  opportunity  for  a
  hearing, suspend or revoke such license. Notice of such suspension or of
  a determination by the commission or successor agency to seek suspension
  or  revocation  of a taxicab, for-hire vehicle license or a HAIL license
  shall be served on the licensee by personal delivery or by certified and
  regular mail within five calendar days of the pre-hearing suspension  or
  of such determination. The licensee shall have an opportunity to request
  a  hearing  before  an administrative tribunal of competent jurisdiction
  within ten calendar days after receipt of any  such  notification.  Upon
  request such hearing shall be scheduled within ten calendar days, unless
  the  commission  or successor agency or other administrative tribunal of
  competent jurisdiction determines that such hearing would be prejudicial
  to an ongoing criminal or civil investigation. If the tenth day falls on
  a Saturday, Sunday or holiday, the hearing  may  be  held  on  the  next
  business  day.  A  decision  shall  be  made  with  respect  to any such
  proceeding within sixty calendar days after the close of the hearing. In
  the event such decision is not made within that time period, the license
  or medallion which is the subject of the proceeding shall be returned by
  the commission or successor agency to the licensee and deemed to  be  in
  full  force  and  effect  until  such  determination is made, unless the
  commission or successor  agency  or  other  administrative  tribunal  of
  competent   jurisdiction   determines   that   the   issuance   of  such
  determination would be prejudicial  to  an  ongoing  criminal  or  civil
  investigation.
    b.  It shall be an affirmative defense that the holder of the taxicab,
  for-hire vehicle license or a HAIL license or the owner of the  taxicab,
  for-hire  vehicle or HAIL vehicle has (1) exercised due diligence in the
  inspection, management and/or operation of the taxicab, for-hire vehicle
  or HAIL vehicle and (2) did not know or have reason to know of the  acts
  of  any  other  person  with  respect  to that taxicab license, for-hire
  vehicle license or a HAIL license or taxicab, for-hire vehicle  or  HAIL
  vehicle  upon  which  a  suspension,  proposed  suspension  or  proposed
  revocation  is  based.  With  respect  to  any  violation  arising  from
  taximeter  tampering, an owner's due diligence shall include, but not be
  limited to, those actions set forth in subdivision h of section 19-507.1
  of this chapter. Any pre-hearing  suspension  period  shall  be  counted
  towards any suspension period made in any final determination.
