Section 19-508

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 19-508 Meters, radios and other equipment.  a. All taxicabs shall be
  equipped  with  meters,  and the equipment which shall store or transmit
  for storage fare data, including, but not limited to, the rate  of  fare
  and  the  times  or locations such rate of fares were in effect, pick up
  and  drop-off  information  and  any  other  data  as  required  by  the
  commission.  All  data  required  to  be  stored  or transmitted by such
  equipment shall be made available to the commission in a form and manner
  as required by the commission. A  licensed  driver's  fare  information,
  including rate of fare and pickup and drop-off information shall be made
  available  to such driver as required by the commission, at no charge to
  such drivers. The  commission  shall  prescribe  by  rule,  contract  or
  otherwise,  responsibility  for  compliance  with the provisions of this
  section, and for penalties for non-compliance with such provisions.  The
  commission  may permit or require other licensed vehicles to be equipped
  with the same or different types of meters.
    b. The commission may permit or require the installation of  radio  or
  other equipment of specified types in licensed vehicles, except that the
  commission  shall  require  that  all wheelchair accessible vans contain
  two-way radios where  the  owner  employs  a  dispatcher,  a  number  of
  portable  or  fixed seat belts equal to the maximum capacity of the van,
  safety ties sufficient to secure any wheelchair or wheelchairs which the
  van may at any  given  time  be  transporting  and  such  other  special
  equipment  as  the commission shall determine is necessary to insure the
  safe transportation of physically handicapped  persons.  The  commission
  shall  require  the  use  of a specified frequency for any radio used by
  licensed  vehicles,  said  frequency  to  be  assigned  by  the  federal
  communications commission.
    c.  1.  For  purposes  of this section, the term "trouble light" shall
  mean a help or distress signaling light system consisting  of  two  turn
  signal type "lollipop" lights.
    2. Every for-hire vehicle or taxicab placed into operation shall carry
  a  minimum  of  two  spare  turn signal type "lollipop" lights of a type
  approved by the commission. In the event that any authorized enforcement
  agent indicates to  a  for-hire  vehicle  or  taxicab  driver  that  the
  vehicle's  trouble  light  is  defective,  such  driver  shall  have the
  opportunity to return such defective trouble  light  to  proper  working
  order by replacing one or both bulbs, or by any other corrective action,
  in  the presence of such enforcement agent. If the replacement of a bulb
  or bulbs, or any other corrective action, restores the trouble light  to
  proper  working  order,  no summons or notice of violation may be issued
  for operating a for-hire vehicle or taxicab  with  a  defective  trouble
  light.  In  the event that repair of the defective condition is not made
  in the presence of such enforcement agent and a  summons  or  notice  of
  violation  is issued for a defective for-hire vehicle or taxicab trouble
  light, such summons or notice of violation shall  be  dismissed  by  the
  adjudicatory  body  before  which such summons or notice of violation is
  heard if:  (a)  proof  that  repair  of  such  defect  was  made  within
  twenty-four  hours of the issuance of the summons or notice of violation
  is provided to the adjudicatory body and (b) the vehicle  was  not  used
  for  hire  during  the period of time from when the summons or notice of
  violation was issued to the time the repair was made.
    3.  Any  person  found  to  have  violated  the  provisions  of   this
  subdivision  shall  be  liable  for  a  fine of one hundred seventy-five
  dollars for each such violation and in addition thereto the license  for
  such  vehicle  shall  be  suspended  until  the  defective  condition is
  corrected.
