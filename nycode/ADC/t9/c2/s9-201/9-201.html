    &sect; 9-201 Probation administrative fee.
    a.  In  accordance  with  section  257-c  of  the  executive  law, any
  individual currently serving or who shall be sentenced to  a  period  of
  probation  upon  conviction of any crime under article thirty-one of the
  vehicle and traffic law shall pay to  the  department  of  probation  an
  administrative fee of thirty dollars per month.
    b. The provisions of subdivision six of section 420.10 of the criminal
  procedure   law   shall   govern  for  purposes  of  collection  of  the
  administrative fee.
    c. The administrative fee authorized by  this  subdivision  shall  not
  constitute, nor be imposed, as a condition of probation.
    d.  The  department  of  probation  shall  waive  all  or  part of the
  administrative fee where, because of the indigence of the offender,  the
  payment of the administrative fee would work an unreasonable hardship on
  the  person  convicted, his or her immediate family, or any other person
  who is dependent on such person for financial support.
    e. In the event of non-payment of any fees that have not  been  waived
  by the department of probation, the city of New York may seek to enforce
  payment in any manner permitted by law for enforcement of a debt.
    f.  Monies  collected  pursuant  to this section shall be utilized for
  probation services by the department of probation.
