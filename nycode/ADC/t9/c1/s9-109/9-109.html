    &sect; 9-109 Classification. The commissioner of correction shall so far as
  practicable  classify  all  felons, misdemeanants and violators of local
  laws under the commissioner's charge,  so  that  the  youthful  or  less
  hardened  offenders  shall be segregated from the older or more hardened
  offenders. The commissioner of correction may set apart one or  more  of
  the penal institutions for the custody of such youthful or less hardened
  offenders, and he or she is empowered to transfer such offenders thereto
  from  any  penal institution of the city. The commissioner of correction
  is empowered to classify the transferred inmates, so far as practicable,
  with regard to age, nature of offense, or other fact, and to separate or
  group such offenders according to such classification.
