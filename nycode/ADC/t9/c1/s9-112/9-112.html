Section 9-112

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  9-112  Suspension of members of the uniformed force. Where a member
  of the uniformed force shall be charged with the commission of a  crime,
  he or she may be suspended without pay for the duration of the time that
  said  criminal  charges  are pending final disposition. If the member is
  found not guilty of such criminal charges he or she shall be  paid  full
  back  pay  for  the  period  of  suspension.  However,  after  the final
  disposition of said criminal charges no member of  the  uniformed  force
  shall  be suspended without pay for more than thirty days while awaiting
  disposition of departmental charges against such member. If  the  member
  is  found  not  guilty  of the departmental charges such member shall be
  paid full back pay for the period he or she  had  been  suspended  while
  awaiting disposition of the departmental charges against such member. In
  the  event  an  award  of back pay is made pursuant to this section, the
  amount of any salary or income earned by the  member  of  the  uniformed
  force during the period of suspension shall be deducted from the award.
