<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  14-118.1  Voluntary  fingerprinting  of  school  children.  a.  The
  commissioner shall, in cooperation with the board  of  education,  local
  school  boards and private schools, institute a program to train persons
  designated  by  the  appropriate  school  authority  to  administer  the
  voluntary  fingerprinting  of  New  York  city public and private school
  students in grades kindergarten through twelve and such  persons  to  be
  trained shall not be police or police auxiliary personnel.
    b.  The program shall provide resources so that every school may offer
  the parents or legal guardians of a child the opportunity  to  have  the
  child fingerprinted at school.
    c.   No  child  may  be  fingerprinted  without  first  presenting  an
  authorization form signed by a parent or legal guardian. Notwithstanding
  parental consent, any child over the age of fourteen shall also sign  an
  authorization form, or may refuse to participate in the program.
    d.  Any  fingerprints  or other information supplied under the program
  shall be placed in the sole custody of  the  child's  parents  or  legal
  guardians  on  the  same  day  as supplied and no copy or record of such
  fingerprints shall be retained by the commissioner or the  school.  Upon
  the  child  attaining  the  age  of  eighteen years, said child shall be
  entitled to the return of his/her fingerprints from the parents or legal
  guardians.
