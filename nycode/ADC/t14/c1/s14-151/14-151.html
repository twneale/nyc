Section 14-151

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  14-151  Bias-based Profiling Prohibited. a. Definitions. As used in
  this section, the following terms have the following meanings:
    1. "Bias-based profiling" means an act of a member of the force of the
  police department or other law enforcement officer that relies on actual
  or perceived race, national  origin,  color,  creed,  age,  alienage  or
  citizenship  status,  gender, sexual orientation, disability, or housing
  status as the determinative factor in initiating law enforcement  action
  against  an  individual,  rather  than an individual's behavior or other
  information or circumstances that links a person or persons to suspected
  unlawful activity.
    2. "Law enforcement officer" means  (i)  a  peace  officer  or  police
  officer  as defined in the Criminal Procedure Law who is employed by the
  city of New York; or (ii) a special patrolman appointed  by  the  police
  commissioner pursuant to section 14-106 of the administrative code.
    3.  The  terms  "national  origin,"  "gender,"  "disability,"  "sexual
  orientation," and "alienage or citizenship status" shall have  the  same
  meaning as in section 8-102 of the administrative code.
    4.  "Housing  status" means the character of an individual's residence
  or lack thereof, whether publicly  or  privately  owned,  whether  on  a
  temporary or permanent basis, and shall include but not be limited to:
    (i)  an  individual's ownership status with regard to the individual's
  residence;
    (ii) the status of having or not having a fixed residence;
    (iii) an individual's use of publicly assisted housing;
    (iv) an individual's use of the shelter system; and
    (v) an individual's actual or perceived homelessness.
    b. Prohibition.
    1. Every member of the police  department  or  other  law  enforcement
  officer shall be prohibited from engaging in bias-based profiling.
    2.  The  department  shall  be  prohibited from engaging in bias-based
  profiling.
    c. Private Right of Action
    1. A claim of bias-based profiling is established under  this  section
  when an individual brings an action demonstrating that:
    (i)  the  governmental  body  has  engaged  in  intentional bias-based
  profiling of one or more individuals and the governmental body fails  to
  prove  that  such  bias-based  profiling  (A)  is necessary to achieve a
  compelling governmental  interest  and  (B)  was  narrowly  tailored  to
  achieve that compelling governmental interest; or
    (ii)  one  or more law enforcement officers have intentionally engaged
  in bias-based  profiling  of  one  or  more  individuals;  and  the  law
  enforcement  officer(s)  against  whom such action is brought fail(s) to
  prove that the law enforcement  action  at  issue  was  justified  by  a
  factor(s) unrelated to unlawful discrimination.
    2.  A  claim  of  bias-based  profiling is also established under this
  section when:
    (i) a policy or practice within the police department or  a  group  of
  policies  or  practices  within  the  police  department  regarding  the
  initiation of law enforcement action has had a disparate impact  on  the
  subjects  of  law  enforcement  action  on  the basis of characteristics
  delineated in paragraph 1 of subdivision a of this  section,  such  that
  the policy or practice on the subjects of law enforcement action has the
  effect of bias-based profiling; and
    (ii)  The police department fails to plead and prove as an affirmative
  defense  that  each  such  policy  or  practice  bears   a   significant
  relationship  to  advancing  a  significant law enforcement objective or
  does not contribute to the disparate impact; provided, however, that  if
  such  person  who  may  bring  an  action  demonstrates  that a group of

  policies or practices results in a disparate impact, such  person  shall
  not  be  required  to  demonstrate  which specific policies or practices
  within the group results in such  disparate  impact;  provided  further,
  that a policy or practice or group of policies or practices demonstrated
  to  result in a disparate impact shall be unlawful where such person who
  may bring an action produces substantial evidence  that  an  alternative
  policy  or  practice  with  less  disparate  impact is available and the
  police department  fails  to  prove  that  such  alternative  policy  or
  practice would not serve the law enforcement objective as well.
    (iii)  For  purposes of claims brought pursuant to this paragraph, the
  mere existence  of  a  statistical  imbalance  between  the  demographic
  composition of the subjects of the challenged law enforcement action and
  the  general  population  is  not  alone sufficient to establish a prima
  facie case of disparate impact violation unless the  general  population
  is  shown to be the relevant pool for comparison, the imbalance is shown
  to be statistically significant and there is an identifiable  policy  or
  practice  or  group  of  policies or practices that allegedly causes the
  imbalance.
    d. Enforcement
    1. An  individual  subject  to  bias-based  profiling  as  defined  in
  paragraph  1  of subdivision a of this section may file a complaint with
  the New York City Commission on Human Rights, pursuant to Title 8 of the
  Administrative Code of the City of New York, or may bring a civil action
  against (i) any governmental  body  that  employs  any  law  enforcement
  officer  who  has  engaged,  is  engaging,  or  continues  to  engage in
  bias-based profiling, (ii) any law enforcement officer who has  engaged,
  is  engaging,  or continues to engage in bias-based profiling, and (iii)
  the police department where it has engaged, is engaging, or continues to
  engage in bias-based profiling or policies or practices  that  have  the
  effect of bias-based profiling.
    2.  The  remedy  in  any  civil  action  or  administrative proceeding
  undertaken pursuant to this section shall be limited to  injunctive  and
  declaratory relief.
    3.  In any action or proceeding to enforce this section, the court may
  allow a prevailing plaintiff reasonable attorney's fees as part  of  the
  costs, and may include expert fees as part of the attorney's fees.
    e.  Preservation  of  rights. This section shall be in addition to all
  rights, procedures, and  remedies  available  under  the  United  States
  Constitution,  Section  1983  of Title 42 of the United States Code, the
  Constitution of the State of New York and all other federal  law,  state
  law,  law  of  the  City of New York or the New York City Administrative
  Code, and all pre-existing civil remedies, including  monetary  damages,
  created by statute, ordinance, regulation or common law.
