  criminal court. a. Every arrest made by any member of the force shall be
  made known immediately to the superior on duty in the  precinct  wherein
  the arrest was made, by the person making the same. It shall be the duty
  of  such  superior,  to  make  written  return  of  such  arrest  within
  twenty-four hours,  according  to  the  rules  and  regulations  of  the
  department,  with  the  name of the party arrested, the alleged offense,

  immediately upon an arrest, shall convey in person the  offender  before
  the  nearest  sitting judge of the criminal court, that he or she may be
  dealt with according to law. If the arrest is made during the hours that
  the judge of the criminal court does not regularly hold court, or if the
  judge of the criminal court is not holding court, such offender  may  be
  detained  in a precinct or station house thereof, until the next regular
  public sitting of the judge of the criminal court, and  no  longer,  and
  shall  then  be  conveyed without delay before the judge of the criminal
  court to be dealt with according to law.
