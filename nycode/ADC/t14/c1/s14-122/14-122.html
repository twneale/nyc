    &sect;  14-122  Relief from active duty due to disability. The commissioner
  shall have power to relieve from active duty on patrol any member of the
  police force, who, while in the actual performance of duty  and  without
  fault  or  misconduct  on  his  or her part, shall have become disabled,
  physically, as a result of injuries or illness attributable thereto,  so
  as  to be unfit to perform full police duty, such disability having been
  certified to by so many of the police surgeons as the  commissioner  may
  require.  Such  member  may be assigned to the performance of such light
  duties as he or she may be qualified to perform.
