  feasibility  of  fostering  public/private  partnerships  to develop and
  implement job centers for day laborers.
    b. The Commission shall consist of 20 members, at  least  12  of  whom
  shall  be  immigrant  day  laborers  or  representatives  of groups with
  experience working on issues affecting immigrant day laborers. The mayor
  shall appoint six of these members, at least  three  of  whom  shall  be
  immigrant  day  laborers,  and  the  speaker  of  the city council shall
  appoint six of these members, at least four of whom shall  be  immigrant
  day  laborers.  The mayor shall appoint four of the remaining members of
  the Commission, who shall include the commissioner of the mayor's office
  on immigrant affairs, the  commissioner  of  the  department  for  small
  business  services  and  the  commissioner  of  the new york city police
  department, or their designees. The speaker of the  city  council  shall
  appoint  four  of the remaining members. The Commission shall be chaired
  by the commissioner for the mayor's office of  immigrant  affairs  or  a
  designee.  The  Commission  shall  include  at  least  one  person  with
  experience in academic research regarding immigrant day labor.
    c. The members of the Commission shall be appointed within  forty-five
  days  of  the  effective  date  of  this section and shall serve without
  compensation, except that  each  member  shall  be  allowed  actual  and
  necessary  expenses  to  be  audited  in  the  same manner as other city
  charges. Any member of the Commission may be removed from the Commission
  by the appointing official for cause. Any vacancy occurring  by  removal
  or  for  any  other reason shall be filled by the appointing official in
  the same manner as the original appointment. The terms of members of the
  Commission shall expire one  month  after  the  Commission  submits  the
  report required by subdivision h of this section.
    d.  Membership on the Commission shall not constitute the holding of a
  public office and members of the Commission shall  not  be  required  to
  take and file oaths of office before serving on the Commission.
    e.  No  person  shall  be  ineligible for membership on the Commission
  because such person holds any public office, employment  or  trust,  nor
  shall  any  person be made ineligible for or forfeit such person's right
  to any public office, employment or trust by reason of such appointment.
    f. The Commission may ask the mayor's office on immigrant  affairs  to
  provide  staff  assistance  to  the  Commission in all matters under the
  Commission's jurisdiction.
    g. The Commission may request and may  receive  information  from  any
  agency  as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter,
  in accordance with applicable laws, rules  and  regulations,  including,
  but  not  limited  to,  the  exceptions  to disclosure of agency records
  contained in the public officers law. Nothing in this chapter  shall  be
  construed  as  limiting  any right or obligation of agencies pursuant to
  the public officers law,  including  the  exceptions  to  disclosure  of
  agency  records  contained  in  such  law,  with respect to access to or
  disclosure of records or  portions  thereof.  The  commission  also  may
  request  from  any  private organization providing services to immigrant
  day laborers information necessary to carry out the provisions  of  this
  chapter.
    h.  No later than nine months from the effective date of the local law
  that added this chapter, the Commission shall submit to  the  Mayor  and
  the  Speaker  of  the  Council  a  report  containing  the  findings and
  recommendations of the Commission.
