Section 21-507

<pre>
    
 
    * &sect;  21-507  Grievance procedure. The commissioner shall establish and
  maintain  a  grievance  procedure  for  the  filing  and  resolution  of
  complaints   by  participants  who  are  not  members  of  a  collective
  bargaining unit. Such grievance procedure shall provide  for  a  hearing
  within  twenty  business  days  after  the  filing  of  a  participant's
  complaint. The commissioner shall notify the participant  of  the  date,
  time,  and  place  of  the  hearing  within five business days after the
  filing of such complaint. The commissioner  may  attempt  to  informally
  resolve  any  complaint prior to the hearing, but any such attempt shall
  not delay the date of the hearing,  unless  a  participant  specifically
  consents  in  writing  to  a  postponement  of  such  hearing. A written
  decision shall be issued within ten business  days  after  the  hearing.
  Nothing  in  this  section  shall be construed to limit the right of any
  participant, including a participant who is a  member  of  a  collective
  bargaining  unit  or  a participant represented by a designated employee
  spokesperson,  from  pursuing  other  available   remedies   under   any
  applicable  collective  bargaining  agreement,  or any federal, state or
  local law.
    * NB Declared invalid by NYS Supreme Court 5/9/2003
