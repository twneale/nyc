Section 21-502

<pre>
    
 
    * &sect; 21-502 Transitional jobs program.
    a. The mayor shall direct the commissioner to establish a transitional
  jobs  program,  which  shall  consist  of  a  total of two thousand five
  hundred temporary jobs in  the  public  sector  and  in  community-based
  organizations,  at  least  two-thirds  of  which shall be created within
  local government agencies in the public sector. Such total number of two
  thousand five hundred  temporary  jobs  shall  exist  for  a  period  of
  thirty-six  months,  commencing  on  January  first,  two  thousand one;
  provided, however,  that  each  participant  in  the  transitional  jobs
  program   shall   only   be  employed  by  a  sponsoring  or  affiliated
  organization for a period not to exceed twelve  months,  and  that  each
  specific  job created pursuant to the transitional jobs program shall be
  retained for at least twelve months. An initial group  of  two  thousand
  five  hundred  participants  shall commence employment on January first,
  two  thousand  one.  A  second  group  of  two  thousand  five   hundred
  participants  shall  commence  employment on January first, two thousand
  two, and a final group of two thousand five hundred  participants  shall
  commence employment on January first, two thousand three.
    b.  The  jobs  created  in  local government agencies pursuant to this
  chapter shall, consistent with applicable collective bargaining laws and
  agreements, be accreted to appropriate  existing  collective  bargaining
  units.
    c.  In  implementing  the  transitional  jobs program, the mayor shall
  direct the commissioner to select which local government agencies  shall
  be   sponsoring   organizations.   In  making  such  determination,  the
  commissioner may work in cooperation with  the  commissioners  of  other
  local  government  agencies  and  may, consistent with obligations under
  collective bargaining laws and agreements, consult  with  the  heads  of
  collective  bargaining  organizations, and may consider each prospective
  agency's prior experience hiring welfare recipients and the  unemployed,
  its  prior  experience  assisting  such individuals in finding jobs, its
  prior experience providing education and  training,  career  counseling,
  and  related  services to its employees, its plans to address or fulfill
  the needs of communities throughout the city of New York, its  plans  to
  employ  or facilitate the employment of certified individuals, its plans
  to provide case management to participants, and its plans to  assist  in
  the permanent placement of participants following their participation in
  the transitional jobs program.
    d.  In  meeting  the  goal  of placing participants in community based
  organizations pursuant  to  this  chapter,  the  mayor  may  direct  the
  commissioner  to  issue  a request for proposals or to utilize any other
  procurement  method  that  he  or  she   deems   necessary   to   select
  community-based  organizations  to  become  sponsoring organizations. To
  determine which community-based organizations  shall  become  sponsoring
  organizations,  the  commissioner  may  consider an organization's prior
  experience hiring welfare  recipients  and  the  unemployed,  its  prior
  experience  assisting  such  individuals  in  finding  jobs,  its  prior
  experience providing education  and  training,  career  counseling,  and
  related  services  to its employees, its plans to address or fulfill the
  needs of communities throughout the city  of  New  York,  its  plans  to
  employ  or facilitate the employment of certified individuals, its plans
  to provide case management to participants, and its plans to  assist  in
  the permanent placement of participants following their participation in
  the  transitional jobs program. Where the employees of a community-based
  organization that has been selected to become a sponsoring or affiliated
  organization  are  members  of  a  collective  bargaining   unit,   such
  collective  bargaining unit shall, consistent with applicable collective
  bargaining laws and agreements, have the opportunity to comment on  such

  selection.  The  commissioner  shall  respond  to  such  comments within
  fifteen days of their receipt.
    e. Each sponsoring or affiliated organization may employ any certified
  individual,  and employment with a sponsoring or affiliated organization
  shall be for a period not to exceed twelve months.
    f. The sponsoring organizations shall provide  each  participant  with
  the  necessary  case  management to enable the participant to succeed in
  the transitional jobs program, build his or her job skills, and  enhance
  his  or her chances of securing permanent employment after participating
  in the transitional jobs program.
