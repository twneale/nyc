  lack  of  basic  work-related  skills,  a high school diploma or English
  proficiency. In addition, any person who is  either  a  teen  parent,  a
  former  substance  user,  disabled,  homeless  or  a  victim of domestic
  violence, or any person who  has  a  criminal  record,  HIV/AIDS  or  an
  HIV/AIDS-related  illness or any other life-threatening illness shall be
  presumed to face serious barriers to employment;
    2. To establish an application procedure for those individuals seeking
  to participate in the transitional jobs program;
    3.  To  request  that  community-based  organizations  and  all  local
  government   agencies,   including  private  industry  councils,  social
  services  intake  centers  and  unemployment  offices,   publicize   the
  existence  of the transitional jobs program to those individuals who may
  be eligible to participate in such program;
    4. To notify recipients of family assistance and safety net assistance
  of their right to apply  for  participation  in  the  transitional  jobs
  program;
    5.   To   certify   eligible  individuals  for  participation  in  the

  of their certification in writing,  and  to  establish  a  list  of  all
  certified individuals for use by the sponsoring organizations;
    6.  To  develop  an assessment formula to evaluate the job skills, the
  prior work and educational experience and the case management  needs  of
  each  certified  individual,  and  to  provide  such  information to the
  appropriate sponsoring organization;
    7.  To  ensure  that  the  sponsoring   organizations   provide   each
  participant  with  the necessary case management to help the participant
  to succeed in the transitional  jobs  program,  build  his  or  her  job
  skills,  and enhance his or her chances of securing permanent employment
  after participating in the transitional jobs program;
    8. To ensure that participants are informed of  their  eligibility  to
  receive  state  and  federal  earned  income  tax credit and are offered
  assistance in applying for advance payment of such credit;
    9. To ensure that each community-based organization is  in  compliance
  with  section  21-505(g)  of  this chapter, and to further ensure that a
  community-based  organization  that  submits  false  information   under
  section  21-505(g)  of  this  chapter  shall  not  be  permitted to be a
  sponsoring or affiliated organization in the transitional jobs  program;
  and

  forth in this section are carried out by public employees.
