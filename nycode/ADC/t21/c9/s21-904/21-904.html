  new comprehensive plan to provide services to children in  contact  with
  ACS  who  may  be  deemed eligible for Special Immigrant Juvenile Status
  ("SIJS") or other immigration benefits. Such plan shall, at  a  minimum,
  systemize  how  ACS,  with  assistance  from  foster  care agencies, (i)
  identifies the country of birth, to the extent practicable, of  children
  in  contact  with ACS; (ii) identifies all children within ACS, as early
  as possible, who may qualify for SIJS  or  other  immigration  benefits;
  (iii)  tracks  such  children,  to the extent practicable and consistent
  with client confidentiality requirements, until the completion of  their
  SIJS or other immigration relief; (iv) assists such children, as soon as
  they  are  identified,  in obtaining the immigration services they need,
  including birth certificates if  they  do  not  possess  them;  and  (v)
  provides  mandatory training programs on immigration benefits, including
  SIJS, for appropriate ACS and contract agency case workers and staff.
    b. Reporting. 1. Six months from the effective date of this local law,
  ACS shall submit the plan to the city council. 2. The plan shall include
  detailed descriptions of (i) how ACS  will  accomplish  a(i)-(v)  above;
  (ii)  the  structure  and  operation  of  the ACS offices that will have
  responsibility for identifying, tracking and ensuring  the  referral  of
  youths for SIJS or other immigration benefits; (iii) the number and type
  of  positions  within ACS that will have responsibility for identifying,
  tracking  and  ensuring  the  referral  of  youths  for  SIJS  or  other
  immigration  benefits,  including  whether each such position is full or
  part time  and  temporary  or  permanent;  (iv)  program  standards  for
  contract  agencies  regarding  SIJS  identification  and coordination of
  immigration services; (v) ACS's mechanisms and indicators for monitoring
  its own and contract agencies' compliance with  and  achievements  under
  the  plan;  and  (vi) ACS's method(s) for collecting data and evaluating
  outcomes for immigrant youth that it has made contact with under the new
  plan. 3. No later than one year after completion and submission  of  the
  plan,  ACS  shall  prepare  and  submit to the city council a report (i)
  regarding its ability to  identify,  track  and  coordinate  immigration
  services  for  youths  with  whom  it  has  had contact; (ii) containing
  indicators sufficient to show the agency's  progress  towards  achieving
  the  goals  of the plan; and (iii) containing such programs, procedures,
  memoranda, or training materials as concern the implementation and goals
  of the plan. Subsequent reports shall be submitted annually on the first
  of April thereafter.
