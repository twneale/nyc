Section 21-704

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  21-704  Notice  of rights and responsibilities. a. The agency shall
  inform  applicants,  recipients  and   participants   of   all   rights,
  entitlements and agency obligations required under this chapter.
    b.  Any  notice  directing  an  applicant, recipient or participant to
  report for an assessment, the development of an employability plan, or a
  work-related assignment, shall contain a description of  the  rights  to
  pursue  education  and training activities as set forth in this chapter,
  and shall contain the following statement:
    "Your Education and Training Rights
    When you come for your appointment, we will tell you about your rights
  to participate in education and training programs. The hours  you  spend
  in   education   and  training  programs  may  count  toward  your  work
  requirement.
    A Master List of Programs
    You have a right to receive the complete "HRA Consolidated Master List
  of Approved Training Programs." This is a list of education and training
  programs you can choose to go to. Hours spent in  any  program  on  that
  list will count toward your work requirement.
    Other Choices for Training and Education
    You  can also go to education or training programs that are not on the
  Consolidated Master List. However, those programs must meet  appropriate
  City or State standards.
    Time To Find the Right Program for You
    If  you  need  to  participate  in an education or training program in
  order to improve your chances of getting a job,  we  must  give  you  15
  business  days  before  your  assessment,  upon your request, to find an
  appropriate education or training program.
    If You Are Already In an Education or Training Program
    If you are already in school we must  allow  you  to  remain  in  your
  program  as long as your program appears on the "HRA Consolidated Master
  List of Approved Training Programs" or meets the City or State standards
  mentioned above.
    Reassessment
    If you are dissatisfied with the work activity to which you have  been
  assigned for six months or more and you believe that you are eligible to
  attend  education or training, you should request a reassessment of your
  employability. If you are found to be eligible to attend a  training  or
  education program, you can switch into an education or training program.
  Again,  your  choice must appear on the "HRA Consolidated Master List of
  Approved Training Programs" or meet appropriate City or State standards.
  If you are already in a work activity, you do not have a 15 business day
  period to find an education or training program. In this case, you  must
  continue  in  your  work  activity  while  you  look for an education or
  training program.
    Your Right to a Fair Hearing
    The agency must give you a copy of your employability plan. You have a
  right to a fair hearing to challenge your assignment."
