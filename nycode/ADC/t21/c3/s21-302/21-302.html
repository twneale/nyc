    &sect;  21-302  Housing-readiness  training  and aftercare programs. a. The
  commissioner shall establish,  maintain  and  operate  housing-readiness
  training  for  all eligible homeless persons determined to be in need of
  such  training.  This  training  shall  include  such  subjects  as  the
  commissioner  shall  determine  are  necessary  to  enable such eligible
  homeless persons to acquire the skills necessary for adjustment  to  and
  remaining  in  permanent  housing.  On  or before December 31, 1995, the
  commissioner shall promulgate a housing-readiness training  plan  to  be
  used  in  such training as shall be established, maintained and operated
  pursuant  to  this  section.  Beginning  on  December  31,  1995,   such
  housing-readiness training shall be available no less frequently than on
  a quarterly basis.
    b.  The  commissioner  shall establish, maintain and operate aftercare
  programs to assist eligible homeless persons who  have  been  placed  in
  permanent  housing  to  adjust  to  and  remain  in  such  housing.  The
  commissioner shall determine the period for which such eligible homeless
  persons may remain in aftercare  programs.  For  the  purposes  of  this
  section,  aftercare  shall be defined to include, but not be limited to,
  follow-up case  management  services  and  assisting  formerly  eligible
  homeless  persons  who  have  been placed in permanent housing to access
  needed services in their communities.
