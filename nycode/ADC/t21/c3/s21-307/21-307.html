Section 21-307

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  21-307  Interagency  coordinating  council.    a. There shall be an
  interagency coordinating council established by the  mayor  which  shall
  consist  of  representatives  of each city agency providing transitional
  housing or services to eligible  homeless  persons  and  other  homeless
  individuals  and  families.  Such interagency coordinating council shall
  include, but shall not be limited to, representatives of the  department
  of  homeless services, the department of social services, the department
  of housing preservation and development and such other agencies  as  the
  mayor shall designate. The mayor shall designate a deputy mayor to serve
  as chairperson of the interagency coordinating council. The commissioner
  of  the  department  of  homeless  services  shall  provide  appropriate
  personnel  to  assist  the  interagency  coordinating  council  in   the
  performance of its functions.
    b. The interagency coordinating council shall:
    1.  Not  later than October 1, 1995 and each year thereafter, prepare,
  in consultation with the office of  management  and  budget,  an  annual
  breakdown  of each member agency's expenditures for housing and services
  to the homeless in the adopted budget;
    2. review the organization and  operations  of  member  agencies  with
  respect  to  contracted  service  providers  to  the homeless, including
  service delivery, management and evaluation of performance;
    3. recommend means by which the duplication and fragmentation  of  the
  provision  of housing for, and delivery of services to, the homeless may
  be reduced and the efficiency,  effectiveness  and  economy  of  service
  delivery may be enhanced;
    4.   consider  proposals  for  the  improvement  of  transitional  and
  permanent housing programs and service delivery to the homeless; and
    5. recommend to the mayor and the city council joint  agency  projects
  or  programs  which  could  facilitate  more  efficient  use of existing
  resources.
    c. The interagency coordinating council shall meet at least  quarterly
  and  shall  hold  at  least one public hearing annually, at which public
  testimony shall be taken. A report on each such public hearing shall  be
  submitted  in writing to the speaker of the city council within ten days
  of the date on which such public hearing shall have been held. Where the
  interagency coordinating council fails to hold such meetings  or  public
  hearings  as  required  pursuant  to this subdivision, a report shall be
  submitted in writing to the speaker of the  city  council  including  an
  explanation of the failure to hold such meetings or public hearings.
