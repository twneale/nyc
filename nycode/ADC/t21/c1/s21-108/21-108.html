Section 21-108

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 21-108 Support of poor persons by relatives. a. The spouse or parent
  of  a  recipient  of  public assistance or care or of a person liable to
  become in need thereof shall, if of sufficient ability,  be  responsible
  for  the  support  of  such  person,  provided  that  a  parent shall be
  responsible only for the support of his or her minor child. Step-parents
  shall in  a  like  manner  be  responsible  for  the  support  of  minor
  step-children.
    b.  If  a sufficiently able relative of a poor person fails to support
  him or her, as in this section provided, and such person is being  cared
  for  or  is about to be cared for by the commissioner, such commissioner
  may apply to the family court for an order to compel him or her  to  pay
  the  reasonable  charge  determined by such commissioner for the care of
  such  relative  during  his  or  her  stay  in  the  public  or  private
  institution,  or  home where the commissioner has placed him or her. The
  proceedings to be taken to make such order and to enforce the same shall
  be in the name of and conducted by the commissioner.  The  determination
  of such commissioner as to the reasonableness of such charges may at any
  time be reviewed in the family court.
    c.  Evidence that the poor person mentioned in this section is without
  adequate means of support shall be presumptive proof of the  possibility
  of  his  or  her  becoming  a  public  charge. The relative against whom
  proceedings are begun for the support of a poor person shall be taken to
  be of sufficient ability  to  contribute  to  the  support,  unless  the
  contrary  shall affirmatively appear to the satisfaction of the court or
  a judge or justice thereof.
    d. Instead of bringing legal proceedings as in this section specified,
  the commissioner can directly enter into an agreement  with  a  relative
  for the payment of the charges determined by such commissioner to be the
  reasonable  charge  for the care of the person maintained or about to be
  maintained by such commissioner as a public charge.
