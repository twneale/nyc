    &sect;  21-130.  Shelter  and  related  services  for  victims  of domestic
  violence.  a. The city shall provide emergency  shelter  and/or  related
  services  to  victims  of  domestic  violence  to the extent required by
  sections 131-u and 459-a  of  the  social  services  law.  A  victim  of
  domestic  violence  shall  include  any  person  over the age of 16, any
  married person, or any parent accompanied by his or her minor  child  or
  children,  in  situations in which such person, parent or person's child
  is a victim of an act which would constitute a violation  of  the  Penal
  Law, including, but not limited to acts constituting disorderly conduct,
  harassment,   menacing,   reckless  endangerment,  kidnapping,  assault,
  attempted assault, or attempted murder; and
    (1) such act or acts have resulted in  actual  physical  or  emotional
  injury  or have created a substantial risk of physical or emotional harm
  to such person or such person's child; and
    (2) such act or acts are or are alleged to have been  committed  by  a
  family or household member.
    Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this  section,  "Family or
  household members" shall mean the following individuals:
    (i) persons related by blood or marriage;
    (ii) persons legally married to one another;
    (iii) persons formerly married to one another  regardless  of  whether
  they still reside in the same household;
    (iv)  persons  who  have  a child in common regardless of whether such
  persons are married or have lived together at any time;
    (v) unrelated persons who are  continually  or  at  regular  intervals
  living  in  the same household or who have in the past continually or at
  regular intervals lived in the same household; or
    (vi) unrelated persons who have  had  intimate  or  continuous  social
  contact with one another and who have access to one another's household.
    b. Victims of domestic violence who apply for emergency shelter and/or
  related  services  pursuant  to section 131-u of the social services law
  may not be denied emergency shelter or related services solely based  on
  lack of documentary evidence of the incidence of domestic violence, such
  as a police report or order of protection.
