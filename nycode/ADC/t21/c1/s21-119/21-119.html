<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  21-119  Screening  of  child  care  services  personnel by persons,
  corporations or other entities under contract with  the  city.  a.  Each
  person,  corporation,  or  other  entity under contract with the city to
  provide child care services shall be responsible for the recruitment  of
  appropriate  personnel;  verification  of  credentials  and  references;
  review of criminal record information;  screening  of  all  current  and
  prospective  personnel;  and  selection  and  hiring  of  all  personnel
  necessary to furnish child care services. Screening shall  include,  but
  not be limited to (1) fingerprinting; (2) review of criminal convictions
  and  pending  criminal  actions,  provided that the contractor shall not
  dismiss or  permanently  deny  employment  to  current  and  prospective
  personnel  who are subjects of pending criminal actions, but may suspend
  such current personnel or defer employment decisions on such prospective
  personnel until disposition of the pending criminal action; (3)  inquiry
  with the statewide central register of child abuse and maltreatment and;
  (4)  for  prospective personnel, inquiry with the applicant's three most
  recent employers. Each such contractor is hereby authorized and required
  to have all  current  and  prospective  personnel  fingerprinted  by  an
  appropriate city agency.
    b.  As  a  condition  of  employment  and  continued  employment,  the
  contractor shall obtain written consent from all current and prospective
  child care services personnel for  fingerprinting  and  criminal  record
  review. Denial of such consent shall be grounds for dismissal or refusal
  to hire.
    c.  The  department  shall  require appropriate documentation from the
  contractor indicating compliance with this section. The requirements  of
  subdivisions  a and b of this section shall be incorporated in contracts
  for child care services entered into by  the  city,  and  any  violation
  thereof  shall  be a material breach of the contract sufficient to cause
  termination.
    d. For purposes of this section, "personnel" shall  include  day  care
  employees,  family  day  care providers and members of their households,
  and head start employees.
