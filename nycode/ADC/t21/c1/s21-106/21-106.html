Section 21-106

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  21-106 Payments to private institutions. Payments shall not be made
  by the city to any charitable, eleemosynary or reformatory  institutions
  wholly  or  partly under private control, for the care, support, secular
  education or maintenance of any destitute, neglected or delinquent child
  therein, except upon the certificate of the commissioner that such child
  has been received and is retained by such institution  pursuant  to  the
  rules  and regulations established by the state board of social welfare.
  Moneys paid by the city to any such institution for the  care,  support,
  secular  education  or  maintenance of its inmates shall not be expended
  for any other purpose. Whenever the  commissioner  shall  decide,  after
  reasonable notice to such institution and a hearing, that any such child
  who  is received and retained in such institution is not a proper charge
  against the public, and written notice of such decision is given by  the
  commissioner  to  such  institution,  thereupon all right on the part of
  such institution to receive compensation from the city for  the  further
  retention  of  the child shall cease. The commissioner shall file in the
  office of the department a statement of  the  reasons  for  his  or  her
  decision  and of the facts upon which it is founded, and shall furnish a
  copy to such institution where the child is detained. The commissioner's
  decision may be reviewed on certiorari by the supreme court.
    No money shall be paid out of any  appropriation  to  any  charitable,
  eleemosynary  or  reformatory  institution  which  shall  deny  or limit
  admission to  any  destitute,  neglected  or  delinquent  children  duly
  committed  by  the  commissioner or a court of appropriate jurisdiction,
  because of the race, color  or  religion  of  such  children,  provided,
  however,  that  no  institution of a particular religious faith shall be
  required to accept children adhering to a religious faith other than its
  own.
    The commission on foster care of children shall  have  the  power  and
  continuing  duty  to  investigate and determine, upon complaint made and
  shall have the power on its own initiative to investigate and  determine
  whether any institution is practicing discrimination in violation of the
  provisions  of  the  preceding paragraph. The commission may direct that
  such investigation shall be conducted by one or more of its  members  or
  by its secretary or assistant secretary. Whenever in the judgment of the
  commission, such investigation discloses that there is reason to believe
  that  an  institution is practicing discrimination, the commission shall
  cause a hearing to be held before the commission or before two  or  more
  of  its  members,  as  it  may  direct,  upon  reasonable notice to such
  institution. The commission shall dismiss the proceedings  if  it  finds
  upon  the basis of such hearing, that such institution is not practicing
  discrimination. In the event the commission shall find on the  basis  of
  such  hearing,  that  such  institution is practicing discrimination, it
  shall certify to the commissioner its findings of  fact,  together  with
  its  determination of the period of time, not to exceed one year, within
  which the institution shall be permitted  to  amend  its  practices  and
  comply  with  said  provisions.  The  commissioner shall thereupon serve
  notice of such certification on such institution. All right on the  part
  of such institution to receive moneys from the city shall cease upon the
  date  specified  in  said  certification unless, prior to the expiration
  thereof, such institution shall have submitted to the  commission  proof
  that it has ceased to engage in said violations and the commission shall
  have  found  and certified to the commissioner that said institution has
  complied with said provisions. The institution shall not be deprived  of
  payments  for  services  rendered  prior  to  the  date specified in the
  certification. The determination of the commission that  an  institution
  is  practicing  discrimination,  or  having  been  ordered to cease said
  discrimination has failed to cease,  may  be  reviewed  by  the  supreme

  court,  which  may,  for  good  cause shown, during the pendency of such
  review, stay the termination of the right of such institution to receive
  moneys from the city. The commission, or any of its  members  authorized
  by  it  to  conduct  a  hearing,  may,  at  any such hearing, compel the
  attendance of witnesses, administer oaths, take  the  testimony  of  any
  person under oath and require the production of any evidence relating to
  the   matter  in  question  at  the  hearing.  The  department  and  the
  corporation counsel are authorized upon request by  the  commission,  to
  make  members  of  their  respective  staffs available, upon a temporary
  basis, to the commission, to assist it in conducting the  investigations
  and hearings provided by this section.
