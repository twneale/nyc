  shall serve without compensation.
    b. Not later than seven months from the effective date of this section
  as  amended, the temporary task force on child care funding shall submit
  a report to the mayor and the speaker of the council. Such report  shall
  include,  but shall not be limited to: (1) identification of the current
  public and  private  funding  sources  for  child  care  facilities  and
  services;  (2)  analysis  of  the allocation and use of the public funds
  provided to such child care facilities and services; (3) recommendations
