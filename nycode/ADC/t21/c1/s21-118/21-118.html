    &sect;  21-118 New York city commission for the foster care of children. a.
  There is hereby established the New York city commission for the  foster
  care  of  children  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the "commission") to
  consist of fifteen public members, who shall serve without compensation,
  to be appointed by the mayor from among residents of  the  city  of  New
  York  who have been active in, identified with, or otherwise known to be
  interested in the field of child care. In making such appointments,  the
  mayor shall make every effort to appoint individuals associated with the
  major  federations  concerned  with foster care services to children and
  individuals who are associated with organizations which, through  direct
  services to children, coordination or planning of services for children,
  or  through  research  in  the  field  of  child  care, are making major
  contributions to the planning of services for the children of  the  city
  of  New York. The membership of the commission shall reflect disciplines
  basic to a wholesome child  welfare  program  including  mental  health,
  education,  religion,  law  with  some  specialty  in  family  and child
  welfare, and pediatrics. The mayor  may  appoint,  and  at  his  or  her
  pleasure remove, an executive director and an assistant to the executive
  director of the commission. The salary of the executive director and the
  assistant  to  the  executive  director  shall be fixed by the mayor and
  shall be paid from appropriations  made  to  the  department.  The  said
  public members shall serve for a term of four years except that the term
  of  office  of the members first taking office shall expire, five at the
  end of two years, five at the end of three years and five at the end  of
  four  years. No member shall serve for more than eight consecutive years
  after July one, nineteen hundred sixty-four. The mayor shall  appoint  a
  chairperson and a vice chairperson from among the members, each to serve
  in  that capacity for two year terms. Any public member appointed by the
  mayor to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration  of  the  term
  for  which  his  or her predecessor was appointed shall be appointed for
  the remainder of such term.
    b. The commission shall meet at least once every month  except  during
  the  months  of  July  and  August and shall meet at such other times as
  meetings are called by the chairperson. Whenever requested to do  so  in
  writing by any six members of the commission, the chairperson shall call
  a special meeting of the commission. Full time professional and clerical
  assistance,  properly  qualified,  shall  be provided as required to the
  commission by the department.
    c. The commission shall have the following powers and duties:
    (1) Make recommendations to the commissioner and to the administrative
  judge of the family court of the state of New York within  the  city  of
  New  York  on  all  phases  of  the  foster  care  of children including
  recommendations designed to prevent the need for such care.
    (2) Make  recommendations  to  the  appropriate  authorities  for  the
  establishment  of  proper  standards  for  the  foster care of children,
  except insofar as such standards have been established pursuant  to  law
  by  the  board  of health of the city of New York or the board of social
  welfare of the state of New York.
    (3) Study and report the extent and nature of the facilities  required
  to provide adequate foster care for children.
    (4)  Coordinate temporary care services and make recommendations as to
  the type of children and the age range to be admitted to  any  temporary
  shelter, in order that the needs of children may be served by the proper
  and adequate provision of accommodations, and so as to avoid duplication
  or overlapping of service.
    (5)   Individually   or   collectively  visit  temporary  shelters  in
  accordance with rules promulgated by the commission;  recommend  to  the
  commissioner  and to the administrative judge of the family court of the

  state of New York within the city of New York  studies  of  foster  care
  facilities with the cooperation of private agencies.
    (6)  Recommend  that  the department maintain such records and compile
  such statistics as the commission may deem  desirable,  subject  to  the
  approval of the commissioner.
    (7)  Through  appropriate  channels,  advise  foster care agencies and
  institutions receiving public funds  on  all  matters  relating  to  the
  development  and  modification  of programs to meet changing foster care
  needs.
    (8) Make appropriate recommendations to the commissioner  and  to  the
  administrative judge of the family court of the state of New York within
  the  city  of  New  York  for  submission  to  the  mayor on all matters
  affecting the foster  care  of  children,  annually  or  more  often  as
  required.
    (9) Make appropriate recommendations to reduce insofar as possible the
  length of stay of children in temporary shelters.
    d.  Whenever  required  to  do  so  by the commission or an authorized
  representative thereof, any public official or agency of the city of New
  York possessing information relating to the maintenance or operation  of
  institutions  or  agencies  for  the  care  of  children, or maintaining
  records with respect thereto, shall make such  information  and  records
  available,  and  shall  furnish  transcripts  or  copies thereof, to the
  commission.
    e. It shall be the function of this commission to utilize all  methods
  provided  by law to discourage and prevent any discrimination because of
  race, color or national origin in the foster care of children.
    f. In relation to foster care of children the  commission  shall  make
  appropriate  recommendations  for  the  enforcement of all provisions of
  laws relating to foster care including those laws which provide for  the
  preservation  and  protection of the religious faith of the child to the
  end that whenever a child is placed or committed by  the  department  or
  remanded  or  committed by the family court to any family or to any duly
  authorized association, agency, society, or institution, such placement,
  remand or commitment must be made, when practicable, to a family or to a
  duly authorized association, agency, society, or institution  under  the
  control  of persons of the same religious faith or persuasion as that of
  the child; provided that  any  and  all  such  foster  care  placements,
  whenever  made,  shall  assure  the  preservation  and protection of the
  religious faith of the child.
    g. Whenever used in this section the following  terms  shall  mean  or
  include:
    (1)  "Foster  care  for  children."  The care of abandoned, destitute,
  dependent, neglected or  delinquent  children  or  persons  in  need  of
  supervision away from their own homes in institutions or foster homes or
  temporary  shelters,  in  whole  or in part at public expense, under the
  jurisdiction of a social services official or other authorized agency as
  defined in the social services law.
    (2) "Temporary shelter." Any establishment or agency receiving  public
  funds  which  is  operated  or  maintained  for  the  temporary  care of
  destitute, dependent, neglected or delinquent  children  or  persons  in
  need of supervision.
    (3)  "Temporary  care."  Care  of  an  abandoned, destitute dependent,
  neglected or delinquent child or person in need  of  supervision,  in  a
  temporary  shelter  for  a brief and transient period, pending return of
  the child to its own home or placement in long-term care away  from  its
  own home.
