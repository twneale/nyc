  enter  into  a  contract to make rental payments to the owner, landlord,
  lessee, managing agent of, or other person entitled to rent and  receive
  rental  payments for, housing accommodations whenever (a) a recipient of
  public assistance and care  has  neglected  or  failed  to  make  rental
  payment  and  payment  has  not  otherwise  been  made, or (b) a housing
  accommodation is vacant and the owner, landlord, lessee, managing  agent
  or  such  other  person  agrees  in  such  contract to hold such housing
  accommodation vacant and to accept as a new tenant a recipient of public
  assistance and care designated  by  the  commissioner,  and  until  such
  housing  accommodation  is  occupied  by and rental payments are made by
  such new tenant; provided, however, that no  rental  payments  shall  be
  made  in  accordance  with  this provision if such housing accommodation
  remains vacant for more than sixty days.
