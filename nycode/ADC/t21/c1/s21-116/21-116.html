    &sect;  21-116 Commissaries. a. The commissioner may establish a commissary
  at camp LaGuardia and a commissary at the Neponsit home for the aged for
  the use and benefit of the residents and employees thereof.  All  moneys
  received  from  the  sales  in  such  commissaries  shall  be  paid over
  semi-monthly to the  commissioner  of  finance  without  deduction.  The
  provisions of section 12-114 of the code shall apply to every officer or
  employee who receives such money in the performance of his or her duties
  in  such commissaries. The accounts of the commissaries shall be subject
  to supervision, examination and audit by the comptroller and  all  other
  powers  of  the  comptroller  in  accordance  with the provisions of the
  charter and code.
    b. All moneys received from the sales in such  commissaries  shall  be
  kept in a separate and distinct fund to be known as the commissary fund.
  Such fund shall be used for:
    1. The purchase of all merchandise for resale in such commissaries;
    2.  The  purchase  of  supplies,  materials,  and  equipment  for such
  commissaries;
    3. The furnishing of work or labor to be done for such commissaries;
    4. The salaries of all employees of the Neponsit  home  for  the  aged
  commissary  and the incentive allowance authorized by certificate of the
  director of the budget to be paid to the residents of camp LaGuardia who
  are permitted to work in the camp LaGuardia commissary; and
    5. All other costs and expenses of operating such commissaries.
    c. Any surplus remaining in the commissary fund  after  deducting  all
  items  described  in  subdivision b hereof shall be used for the general
  welfare of the residents of camp LaGuardia and the Neponsit home for the
  aged. In the event such fund at any time exceeds ten  thousand  dollars,
  the excess shall be transferred to the general fund.
    d.   All   expenditures  for  items  described  in  paragraph  one  of
  subdivision b of this section shall be made upon vouchers issued by  the
  commissioner  and  subject  to  audit  by  the  comptroller.  All  other
  expenditures described in  subdivision  b  and  subdivision  c  of  this
  section  shall  be made by the commissioner in accordance with schedules
  approved by the mayor or  of  the  director  of  the  budget  acting  in
  accordance  with  a  delegation  of  power from the mayor. All supplies,
  materials, equipment and merchandise to be furnished  and  all  work  or
  labor to be done, the cost of which is payable from the commissary fund,
  shall  be  furnished  or  provided  in accordance with the provisions of
  chapter thirteen of the charter and chapter one of title thirteen of the
  code.
    e. All appointments to positions in the Neponsit  home  for  the  aged
  commissary  shall  be  made in accordance with the civil service law and
  rules. The salaries of employees of such commissary shall  be  fixed  by
  the  mayor.  Such  salaries and all pension contributions required to be
  made by the city on behalf of such employees  shall  be  paid  from  the
  commissary fund.
    f.  Any officer, employee or resident, whose duties in connection with
  the commissary fund involve possession of or control over  funds,  shall
  execute  a  bond  to the city for the faithful performance of his or her
  duties in such sum as may be fixed and with sureties to be  approved  by
  the comptroller, or shall in the alternative be included in the coverage
  of  a blanket bond insuring the city for the faithful performance of his
  or her duties in such sum as may  be  fixed  and  with  sureties  to  be
  approved by the comptroller.
