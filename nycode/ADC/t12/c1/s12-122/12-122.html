Section 12-122

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  12-122  Temporary  transfer  of employees. Whenever the mayor shall
  determine that there is such an accumulation of work in any agency,  the
  performance of which work will impose upon the regular employees thereof
  unreasonable  and unwarranted burden, the mayor, upon application by the
  head of such agency,  and  with  the  consent  of  the  commissioner  of
  citywide  administrative  services,  may  assign  to  it  for  temporary
  employment, employees from any other agency, with  the  consent  of  the
  head  thereof.  Such transfer shall be for a limited period to be stated
  in the order of the mayor and may be extended  if  the  mayor  shall  so
  determine.  Such  transfer shall not in any way affect the civil service
  standing, continuity of service, right to pension, grade or compensation
  of an employee so transferred.
