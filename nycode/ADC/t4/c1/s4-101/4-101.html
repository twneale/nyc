    &sect;  4-101 Acquisition of certain lands; by reversion. In the event that
  any site or plot of ground, transferred to the United  States,  for  the
  erection and maintenance of a light and fog signal at Hunt's Point Park,
  in  the  borough  of the Bronx, should become unnecessary or cease to be
  used for such purposes, such site shall revert to the city, as  if  such
  transfer had not been made.
