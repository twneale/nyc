  the  port  of  New  York or in or upon any dock, wharf, pier, warehouse,
  building or other structure bordering upon or adjacent to such port, may
  prohibit the approach to such fire or to a vessel,  dock,  wharf,  pier,
  warehouse  or  other  building  or structure in danger therefrom, of any
  tugboat or other vessel, or of any person; or may remove or cause to  be
  removed  and  kept  away  from the vicinity of such fire all tugboats or
  other vessels. It shall be  unlawful  for  any  person  in  any  way  to

  of  the department to control the operations in protection of the public
