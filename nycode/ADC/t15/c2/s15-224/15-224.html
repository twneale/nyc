<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  15-224  Service  of  orders.  Orders  of  the  department or of the
  commissioner shall be addressed to  the  owner  or  owners,  lessees  or
  occupants  of  the  building,  structure,  enclosure,  vessel,  place or
  premises affected thereby. It shall be  unnecessary  to  designate  such
  owner  or  owners,  lessees or occupants, by name in any such order, but
  the premises shall be designated in the address, so that the same may be
  readily identified. Service of any such order may be made by delivery of
  a copy thereof to the owner or any one of several owners, to a lessee or
  any one of several lessees,  or  to  any  person  of  suitable  age  and
  discretion  in  charge or apparently in charge of the premises, or if no
  person be found in charge of the premises then by  affixing  a  copy  of
  such order prominently upon the premises.
