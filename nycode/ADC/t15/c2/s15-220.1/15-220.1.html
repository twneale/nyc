Section 15-220.1

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;   15-220.1   False   statements   in  certificates,  forms,  written
  statements, applications, reports or certifications  of  correction.  a.
  Any  person  who  shall  knowingly  make  a false statement or who shall
  knowingly falsify or allow to be falsified any certificate, form, signed
  statement, application, report or certification of the correction  of  a
  violation   required  under  the  provisions  of  any  laws,  rules,  or
  regulations enforceable by the department, shall be punished by  a  fine
  of  not  less  than  one  thousand  dollars  nor more than five thousand
  dollars or by imprisonment not to exceed six months, or  both  for  each
  such offense.
    *  b. Such person shall also be liable for a civil penalty of not less
  than one thousand dollars nor more than five thousand dollars which  may
  be  recovered in a proceeding before the environmental control board. In
  any  such  proceeding  which  relates  to  a  false   statement   in   a
  certification  filed  pursuant  to section 15-230, if an inspection made
  within six  months  after  the  filing  of  the  certification  finds  a
  condition  constituting  a  violation which is the same as the condition
  described in  the  notice  of  violation  with  respect  to  which  such
  certification  was  filed,  there shall be a rebuttable presumption that
  the condition described in such notice of violation continued and is the
  same condition found in the inspection.
 
    * NB Added L.L. 80/85 &sect; 8, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 &sect; 14
