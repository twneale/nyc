  such  suspension  with regard to plastic and beverage cartons shall take
  effect no earlier than July first, two thousand two and shall expire  no
  later  than  June  thirtieth,  two  thousand three. During any period in
  which the collection of glass, plastic or beverage cartons as designated

  department  shall  be  authorized  to  collect  the suspended recyclable
  materials with other non-recyclable solid waste.
    b. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision  of  this  chapter,  the
  department shall be authorized, by written order of the commissioner, to
  suspend  the  provisions  of  section  16-308  of this chapter. Any such

  three  and shall expire no later than June thirtieth, two thousand four.
  During any period in which the provisions  of  section  16-308  of  this

  be  authorized  to  collect  yard  waste with other non-recyclable solid
  waste.
    c. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of this chapter,  during
  a  period  of  suspension,  the  department  shall  only  be required to
  maintain  fiscal  year  two  thousand  two  tonnage  amounts  for  those
  recyclable  materials  whose  collection  has  not  been suspended. Upon
  expiration of any period of  suspension,  the  department  shall  resume
