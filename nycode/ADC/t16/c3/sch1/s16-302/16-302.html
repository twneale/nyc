    &sect; 16-302 Declaration of policy. It is hereby declared to be the public
  policy  of  the  city  to  reduce environmental pollution and dangers to
  health, to decrease the demand for scarce landfill  space,  to  minimize
  the  size  and  cost  of  the proposed resource recovery program, and to
  encourage the conservation of valuable natural resources and energy.  It
  is  the policy of the city to promote the recovery of materials from the
  New York City solid waste stream  for  the  purpose  of  recycling  such
  materials  and  returning  them  to  the  economy. This chapter shall be
  liberally construed in order to effectuate the  purposes  set  forth  in
  this section.
