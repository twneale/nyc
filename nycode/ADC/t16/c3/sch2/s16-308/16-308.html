<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  16-308  Organic  waste.  a.  1.  No  later  than October first, two
  thousand  thirteen,  the  commissioner  shall  establish   a   voluntary
  residential  organic  waste  curbside  collection  pilot program for the
  diversion of organic waste from households in one designated  collection
  area.  Such  pilot  program  shall  end  no earlier than July first, two
  thousand fifteen. For purposes of this subdivision,  a  household  shall
  mean  a  single  dwelling  or  a residential unit within a dwelling that
  contains two or more residential units and a designated collection  area
  shall mean a contiguous area within a borough comprised of no fewer than
  one thousand households.
    2.   No   later   than  January  first,  two  thousand  fourteen,  the
  commissioner shall establish a school  organic  waste  collection  pilot
  program  for  the  diversion  of  organic waste from no fewer than three
  hundred schools located in no fewer than three boroughs. Provided  there
  is  sufficient  capacity  in  trucks on collection routes for such pilot
  program, the department shall provide organic waste  collection  service
  to  residential  buildings  with  nine or more units that are located on
  such collection routes and that  volunteer  for  such  collection.  Such
  pilot  program  shall  end  no  earlier  than  July  first, two thousand
  fifteen.
    3.  No  later  than  January  first,  two   thousand   fourteen,   the
  commissioner  shall  expand  the  voluntary  residential  organic  waste
  curbside collection pilot program established pursuant to paragraph  one
  of  this  subdivision  to  no  fewer  than  a  total of three designated
  collection areas, each of which shall be  in  a  different  borough.  No
  later  than  June  first,  two thousand fourteen, the commissioner shall
  expand the voluntary residential organic waste curbside collection pilot
  program established pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision to  no
  fewer  than  a  total of four designated collection areas, each of which
  shall be in a different borough, with a goal  of  expanding  such  pilot
  program to no fewer than one hundred thousand households by such date.
    4. No later than January first, two thousand fifteen, the commissioner
  shall   expand   the  school  organic  waste  collection  pilot  program
  established pursuant to paragraph two of this subdivision  to  no  fewer
  than  a  total  of  four  hundred  schools located in no fewer than five
  boroughs. Provided there is sufficient  capacity  in  trucks  conducting
  collection  on  collection routes for such pilot program, the department
  shall provide organic waste collection service to residential  buildings
  with  nine  or more units that are located on such collection routes and
  that volunteer for such collection.
    5. The commissioner shall have the authority, during the  duration  of
  the  pilot  program  established  pursuant  to  paragraph  one  of  this
  subdivision, to discontinue voluntary residential organic waste curbside
  collection service to a designated collection area,  provided,  however,
  that  the  commissioner shall select a replacement designated collection
  area within sixty days of any such discontinuation.
    6. The department or its designee shall conduct outreach and education
  to residents for the duration of the pilot programs established pursuant
  to this subdivision. Such outreach and education shall include, but need
  not be limited to,  the  environmental  benefits  of  source  separating
  organic  waste  for  composting, instructions for how to properly source
  separate organic waste and the benefits of reducing organic waste.
    7.  On  June  first,  two  thousand  fourteen  and  every  six  months
  thereafter  for  the duration of the pilot programs established pursuant
  to this subdivision, the department shall report to the  mayor  and  the
  council  the  total amount of organic waste diverted during the previous
  six-month period from households and schools that participated  in  such
  pilot  programs  during  the  entirety  of  such  six-month  period. The

  department shall include such diversion information in the  department's
  annual  recycling  report  required pursuant to subdivision k of section
  16-305 of this chapter.
    8. No later than January first, two thousand fifteen, the commissioner
  shall  conduct  a study on improving community composting and submit the
  findings of such study to the mayor and the  council.  The  study  shall
  include,  but  need  not  be limited to: (i) recommendations for how the
  city can optimize the use of existing community composting locations and
  resources; (ii) an assessment of markets for finished compost within the
  city, including use by city agencies and  potential  retail  sales;  and
  (iii) strategies to expand community composting locations in each of the
  five boroughs.
    9. No later than October first, two thousand fifteen, the commissioner
  shall  issue a report to the mayor and the council on the pilot programs
  established pursuant to this subdivision, which shall include, but  need
  not  be  limited  to  information  on:  (i)  the  number  of households,
  residential buildings, and schools participating; (ii) the total  amount
  of organic waste diverted; (iii) the costs associated with the programs;
  (iv)  the  availability  of  organic material processing capacity in and
  around the  city;  and  (v)  resident  feedback  concerning  such  pilot
  programs,  including the adequacy of the receptacles used for such pilot
  programs and any other issues of  concern.  Such  report  shall  include
  recommendations  as  to  whether the voluntary residential organic waste
  curbside  collection  pilot  program  and  the  school   organic   waste
  collection  pilot  program should be expanded and, if so, a schedule for
  expanding such pilot program to additional designated  collection  areas
  in the city.
    b.  On  and  after  July first, two thousand sixteen, the commissioner
  shall provide for the source separation, collection  and  composting  of
  department-managed  yard  waste generated within designated areas of the
  city in which a substantial amount of yard waste is generated from March
  first to July thirty-first and September first to November thirtieth  of
  each  year,  unless  the  generator  otherwise provides for recycling or
  storage for composting or mulching. In addition, the commissioner  shall
  provide  for  the  collection and composting of yard waste generated and
  source separated at residential properties owned or operated by the  New
  York  city housing authority. There shall be operated by or on behalf of
  the department one or more  yard  waste  composting  facilities  through
  which  the department shall compost yard waste collected by or delivered
  to the department pursuant to this section. In order to comply with this
  provision, the department may utilize the services of privately-owned or
  operated facilities. The department shall also work in consultation with
  the composting  facility  siting  task  force  established  by  the  two
  thousand  and  six  solid  waste  management plan to identify additional
  locations to site yard waste composting  facilities  with  the  goal  of
  establishing at least one such composting facility in each borough where
  the department conducts yard waste composting collection.
    c.  Any city agency, or person under contract with a city agency, that
  generates a substantial amount of yard waste shall, in coordination with
  the department,  provide  for  the  source  separation,  collection  and
  composting  of  such  yard  waste. Unless otherwise provided by law, the
  department shall accept for composting any city agency yard waste source
  separated for department collection pursuant to this subdivision.
    d. Within twenty-four months of the effective date of  the  local  law
  that   amended  this  section,  no  landfill,  waste  transfer  station,
  intermodal facility, incinerator or resource  recovery  facility  owned,
  operated   or   used  by  the  department  shall  accept  truckloads  of
  department-managed waste primarily composed  of  yard  waste  for  final

  disposal  from March 1 to July 31 and September 1 to November 30 of each
  year, except that composted yard waste may be used as part of the  final
  vegetative cover for a department landfill.
    e.  All  city agencies responsible for the maintenance of public lands
  shall to the maximum extent practicable and feasible give preference  to
  the  use  of compost materials derived from the city's yard waste in all
  land maintenance activities.
    f. Generators of yard waste, except those identified in subdivision  g
  of  this  section, shall separate, tie, bundle, or place into paper bags
  or unlined rigid containers, in accordance with rules promulgated by the
  commissioner, any yard waste set out for collection  by  the  department
  pursuant to subdivision b of this section. The commissioner shall notify
  all  residents  in  districts  that receive yard waste collection by the
  department of such pre-collection procedures, and  undertake  any  other
  action necessary to effectuate the purposes of this subdivision.
    g.  No  person  engaged  in a business that generates yard waste shall
  leave such yard waste for collection by the department, or disperse such
  yard waste in or about the curb or  street.  Any  person  engaged  in  a
  business  that  generates  yard  waste  shall be required to collect and
  dispose of such yard waste at a permitted composting facility; provided,
  however, that if the department, by written order of  the  commissioner,
  determines  that  there is insufficient capacity at permitted composting
  facilities within the city of New  York  or  within  ten  miles  of  the
  borough  in  which  any such person generates yard waste, then such yard
  waste may be disposed of at  any  appropriately  permitted  solid  waste
  management facility.
    h. Each permitted composting facility within the city, including those
  operated by city agencies, shall annually report to the commissioner the
  amount  of yard waste and any other organic waste collected and disposed
  of by weight at such composting facility.  All  such  reports  shall  be
  submitted  prior  to  February  first  of  each  calendar year and shall
  contain the amount collected and disposed of for the  previous  calendar
  year.  The department shall consolidate the information contained in all
  reports  prepared  pursuant  to  this  subdivision  and   include   such
  information as part of the department's annual recycling report required
  pursuant to subdivision k of section 16-305 of this chapter.
    i.  No  person  residing  in  a district where the department provides
  residential yard waste composting collection pursuant to  subdivision  b
  of  this  section  shall dispose of grass clippings as regular waste for
  collection by  the  department  during  the  period  of  time  when  the
  department  conducts  such  composting  collection. The department shall
  conduct outreach and education to inform residents within such districts
  of the dates when it will conduct yard waste composting  collection.  No
  person  residing in a district where the department provides residential
  yard waste composting collection shall be held liable for a violation of
  this subdivision during the first  year  the  department  provides  such
  residential yard waste composting collection.
