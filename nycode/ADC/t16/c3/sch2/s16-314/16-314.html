Section 16-314

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  16-314 Recycling program revisions. The commissioner shall annually
  review the recycling program and all rules promulgated  thereunder,  and
  shall  make  the  necessary  revisions  to  improve  the  efficiency  of
  collecting, processing, marketing and  selling  the  materials  recycled
  pursuant  to  this  chapter.  These  revisions  may  include designating
  additional recyclable  materials.  The  commissioner  shall  not  delete
  designated  materials  without  designating additional materials so that
  the total quantity, by weight, of all  designated  recyclable  materials
  collected,  processed,  marketed  and  sold does not decrease. Where the
  commissioner determines that it is appropriate to  delete  a  designated
  material,  the  department  shall provide notice of such deletion to the
  mayor and the council, including the reason for such deletion, and shall
  provide any relevant data supporting such decision.
