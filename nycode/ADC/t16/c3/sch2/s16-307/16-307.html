Section 16-307

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 16-307 City agency waste. a. The commissioner shall adopt, amend and
  implement  rules,  as  necessary,  governing  the  source  separation or
  post-collection separation, collection, processing, marketing, and  sale
  of  designated  recyclable  materials  including,  but  not  limited to,
  designated metal, glass, plastic and paper generated by any  agency,  as
  such term is defined in section 1-112 of the code.
    b.  Every agency shall, no later than July first, two thousand eleven,
  prepare and submit to the commissioner for approval, a waste prevention,
  reuse and recycling  plan.  Such  plan  shall  provide  for  the  source
  separation of designated metal, glass, plastic and paper, and such other
  designated  recyclable  materials as the commissioner deems appropriate,
  in  all  offices  and  buildings  occupied  by  agencies  that   receive
  collection  service  from the department and, to the extent practicable,
  in those that  receive  private  carter  collection.  Such  plans  shall
  provide  for the source separation of designated recyclable materials in
  the lobbies  of  such  offices  or  buildings  that  receive  department
  collection,  unless  the  placement of bins for the source separation of
  designated recyclable materials would  be  in  violation  of  any  other
  provision of law, and, to the extent practicable, in the lobbies of such
  offices or buildings that receive private carter collection. Each agency
  shall  designate  a  lead  recycling  or  sustainability  coordinator to
  oversee implementation of such plans. If an agency has offices  in  more
  than  one  city-owned  building,  then  such  agency shall designate one
  assistant coordinator  for  each  building  in  which  such  agency  has
  offices,  except  the  building in which the lead coordinator has his or
  her office, to assist the agency's lead coordinator.
    c.  On  or  before  July  first,  two  thousand  twelve  and  annually
  thereafter,  every  lead  recycling  or sustainability coordinator shall
  submit a report to the head of his or her respective agency and  to  the
  commissioner,   summarizing   actions   taken  to  implement  the  waste
  prevention, reuse and  recycling  plan  for  the  previous  twelve-month
  reporting  period,  proposed actions to be taken to implement such plan,
  and updates or changes to any information included  in  such  plan.  The
  department  shall  consolidate  the information contained in all reports
  prepared pursuant to this subdivision and include  such  information  as
  part  of  the  department's annual recycling report required pursuant to
  subdivision k of section 16-305 of this chapter.
