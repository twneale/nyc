    &sect;  16-316  Recycling and composting economic development study. Within
  two years of the effective date of  this  section,  the  department,  in
  conjunction   with   the   mayor's  office  of  long-term  planning  and
  sustainability and the New York city economic  development  corporation,
  shall  perform  a study on the economics of recycling and composting and
  the development of recycling and composting-related  industries  in  the
  city  of  New  York.  Such  study  shall:  (i)  assess the New York city
  recycling market including but not limited  to  a  growth  forecast  for
  recycling  markets  and related industries for the next five years; (ii)
  describe those industries or businesses that would address  shortcomings
  in  the  city's  recycling and composting infrastructure and areas where
  opportunities for recycling and composting-related  job  growth  in  the
  city  appear  practical, describing barriers to recycling and composting
  businesses, and outlining financial and other incentives that  might  be
  successful in attracting new recycling and composting-related businesses
  or    encouraging    the    expansion    of   existing   recycling   and
  composting-related  businesses;  (iii)  examine  existing  markets   for
  processing  and  purchasing  recyclable  materials and the potential and
  steps necessary to expand these markets; and (iv)  look  at  the  city's
  taxation and finance authority to stimulate recycling and the demand for
  recycled materials. Sections of such study may be shared with or derived
  from the composting report required pursuant to section 16-316.2 of this
  subchapter.
