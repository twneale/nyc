Section 16-451

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 16-451 Declaration of policy. It is hereby declared to be the public
  policy  of  the  city  of New York to reduce environmental pollution, to
  reduce the toxicity  of  waste  materials  in  the  solid  waste  stream
  directed  to  resource recovery and sanitary landfill facilities, and to
  maximize the removal of plastic carryout bags and film plastic from  the
  waste  stream  in  order to recycle them. Plastic carryout bags and film
  plastic do not biodegrade, which means that such bags and  film  plastic
  ultimately  break  down  into  smaller  pieces that enter the ecosystem.
  These pieces of plastic cause illness, injury and death  to  animal  and
  marine life by entangling them or contaminating their food supplies. The
  production  of  plastic  bags  and  film  plastic worldwide uses over 12
  million barrels of oil per year, which causes significant  environmental
  impacts.
