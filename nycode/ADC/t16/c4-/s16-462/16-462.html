Section 16-462

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  16-462 Rewards. The commissioner shall establish a program to allow
  individuals to submit a sworn statement affirming the observation  of  a
  violation  of section 16-461 of this chapter and, where the commissioner
  deems it appropriate, allow for a reward for any such  sworn  statement.
  Where  a  notice  of  violation  or summons is issued for a violation of
  section 16-461 of this chapter based upon a sworn statement  by  one  or
  more  individuals and where the commissioner determines, in the exercise
  of his or her discretion, that such sworn statement, either alone or  in
  conjunction  with  the  testimony  of  the  person submitting such sworn
  statement at a civil or criminal proceeding or in  a  proceeding  before
  the  environmental  control  board,  contributes  to the imposition of a
  civil or criminal penalty upon any person for  a  violation  of  section
  16-461 of this chapter, the commissioner shall offer as a reward to such
  individual  or individuals an amount that, in the aggregate, is equal to
  fifty percent of any civil  or  criminal  penalty  collected.  No  peace
  officer,  employee  of  the  department  or of the environmental control
  board, employee of any company under contract with  the  department,  or
  employee  of  any  governmental  entity  that,  in  conjunction with the
  department, conducts enforcement activity relating  to  a  violation  of
  section  16-461 of this chapter, shall be entitled to obtain the benefit
  of any such reward when acting in the discharge of his or  her  official
  duties.
