Section 16-464

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 16-464 Enforcement.  a.  1. Any person who violates paragraph one of
  subdivision a of section 16-461 of this chapter shall be liable for  (i)
  a  criminal  fine  of five hundred dollars or imprisonment not to exceed
  forty-eight hours, or both, or (ii) a  civil  penalty  of  five  hundred
  dollars  for  the  first  offense,  seven  hundred fifty dollars for the
  second offense that occurs on a different day within any  eighteen-month
  period  and one thousand dollars for each subsequent offense that occurs
  on a different day within any eighteen-month period. For the purpose  of
  imposing  a  criminal  fine or civil penalty pursuant to this paragraph,
  every building or lot from which recyclable material  has  been  removed
  unlawfully  shall  constitute  a separate violation for which a criminal
  fine or civil penalty may be imposed.
    2. No person shall be in violation of paragraph one of  subdivision  a
  of  section  16-461  of this chapter if such person has removed three or
  fewer recyclable items, in the aggregate, per day  or  if  such  removed
  items  are  loose, individual magazines or soft-cover books that are not
  bundled and tied together with other mixed paper. This  paragraph  shall
  not  apply  to  any refrigerant-containing item, or any large bulk metal
  item as defined by the  commissioner  by  rule,  or  if  the  department
  observes  the  presence  of  additional recyclable material in the motor
  vehicle. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that  the  presence  of
  such  additional recyclable material in the motor vehicle indicates that
  such material was collected in violation of paragraph one of subdivision
  a of section 16-461 of this chapter.
    3. Any  person  who  violates  subparagraph  i  of  paragraph  two  of
  subdivision  a  of  section 16-461 of this chapter shall be liable for a
  civil penalty of one thousand dollars.
    4. Any person who violates subparagraphs iii, iv or v of paragraph two
  of subdivision a of section 16-461 of this chapter shall be liable for a
  civil penalty of one hundred dollars for each such violation.
    5. Any person who violates paragraph three of subdivision a of section
  16-461 of this chapter shall be liable  for  a  civil  penalty  of  five
  hundred dollars.
    b.  Any  person  who  violates subdivision b of section 16-461 of this
  chapter shall be liable for (i) a criminal fine of seven  hundred  fifty
  dollars  or  imprisonment  not  to exceed forty-eight hours, or both, or
  (ii) a civil penalty of  seven  hundred  fifty  dollars  for  the  first
  offense,  one  thousand  dollars for the second offense that occurs on a
  different day within an eighteen-month  period  and  one  thousand  five
  hundred  dollars  for each subsequent offense that occurs on a different
  day within such eighteen-month period. For the  purpose  of  imposing  a
  criminal  fine  or  civil  penalty  pursuant  to this subdivision, every
  building  or  lot  from  which  recyclable  material  has  been  removed
  unlawfully  shall  constitute  a separate violation for which a criminal
  fine or civil penalty may be imposed.
    c. Any person who violates subdivision c of  section  16-461  of  this
  chapter  shall be liable for (i) a criminal fine of one thousand dollars
  or imprisonment not to exceed forty-eight hours,  or  both,  or  (ii)  a
  civil  penalty  of  one  thousand  dollars for the first offense and two
  thousand dollars for each subsequent offense that occurs on a  different
  day  within  any  eighteen-month  period.  For the purpose of imposing a
  criminal fine or civil  penalty  pursuant  to  this  subdivision,  every
  building  or  lot  from  which  recyclable  material  has  been  removed
  unlawfully shall constitute a separate violation for  which  a  criminal
  fine or civil penalty may be imposed.
    d.  1. Any owner of a motor vehicle used in violation of subdivision a
  or b of section 16-461 of this chapter  shall  be  liable  for  a  civil
  penalty  of  five  hundred  dollars for the first offense, seven hundred

  fifty dollars for a second offense within any eighteen-month period  and
  one   thousand   dollars   for   each   subsequent  offense  within  any
  eighteen-month period, regardless of whether the same vehicle  was  used
  in  the  subsequent  offense.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, such motor
  vehicle owner shall not be liable if such  owner  establishes  that  the
  motor  vehicle was used for purposes of violating the provisions of this
  chapter without such owner's permission.
    2. Any owner of a motor vehicle used in violation of subdivision c  of
  section  16-461  of  this chapter shall be liable for a civil penalty of
  one thousand dollars for the first offense and two thousand dollars  for
  each  subsequent offense within any eighteen-month period, regardless of
  whether  the  same  vehicle  was  used  in   the   subsequent   offense.
  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  such  motor vehicle owner shall not be
  liable if such owner establishes that the motor  vehicle  was  used  for
  purposes  of  violating  the  provisions  of  this  chapter without such
  owner's permission.
    3. Any motor vehicle that has been used or is being used to  commit  a
  violation of subdivision a, b or c of section 16-461 of this chapter may
  be  impounded  by  the department and shall not be released until either
  all storage fees and the applicable fines and penalties have  been  paid
  or a bond has been posted in an amount satisfactory to the commissioner.
  Rules  of the department related to the impoundment and release of motor
  vehicles in chapter five of title sixteen of the rules of  the  city  of
  New  York  shall  be  applicable to the impoundment and release of motor
  vehicles pursuant to this paragraph. The  commissioner  shall  have  the
  power to promulgate amended rules concerning the impoundment and release
  of  motor  vehicles  and  the  payment  of  storage  fees for such motor
  vehicles,  including  the  amounts  and  rates  thereof.  Where  it   is
  determined  that the motor vehicle was not used to commit a violation of
  subdivision a, b or c of section 16-461 of this chapter, such fees shall
  be promptly returned.
    4. In addition to any other penalties provided  in  this  subdivision,
  the  interest of a vehicle owner in any motor vehicle impounded pursuant
  to paragraph three of this subdivision shall be  subject  to  forfeiture
  upon notice and judicial determination thereof if such vehicle owner has
  been  convicted  of or found liable for a violation of this chapter in a
  criminal or civil proceeding or in a proceeding before the environmental
  control board  three  or  more  times,  all  of  which  violations  were
  committed within any eighteen-month period.
    5.  Except  as otherwise provided in this subdivision, the city agency
  having custody of  a  motor  vehicle  after  judicial  determination  of
  forfeiture  shall  no  sooner  than thirty days after such determination
  upon a notice of at least five days, sell such forfeited  motor  vehicle
  at public sale. Any person, other than a vehicle owner whose interest is
  forfeited pursuant to this section, who establishes a right of ownership
  in  such motor vehicle, including a part ownership or security interest,
  shall be entitled to delivery of the motor vehicle if such person:
    (i) redeems the ownership interest which was subject to forfeiture  by
  payment to the city of the value thereof;
    (ii)  pays  the  reasonable  expenses of the safekeeping of such motor
  vehicle between the time of seizure and such redemption; and
    (iii) asserts a claim within thirty days after judicial  determination
  of forfeiture.
  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, establishment of a claim shall
  not  entitle  such  person  to  delivery  of  such  vehicle  if the city
  establishes that the violation for which the motor  vehicle  was  seized
  was expressly or impliedly permitted by such person.

    e.  Any  person  who  violates subdivision b of section 16-463 of this
  chapter shall be liable for (i) a criminal fine of one thousand  dollars
  or  imprisonment  not  to  exceed  forty eight hours, or both, or (ii) a
  civil penalty of one thousand dollars for  the  first  offense  and  two
  thousand  dollars  for each subsequent offense within any eighteen-month
  period. For the purpose of imposing a criminal  fine  or  civil  penalty
  pursuant to this subdivision, each receipt from a separate motor vehicle
  of recyclable material shall constitute a separate violation for which a
  criminal fine or civil penalty may be imposed.
    f.  Any  person  who  violates subdivision c of section 16-463 of this
  chapter shall be liable for (i) a criminal fine  of  one  thousand  five
  hundred  dollars  or  imprisonment  not  to exceed forty eight hours, or
  both, or (ii) a civil penalty of one thousand five hundred  dollars  for
  the first offense and three thousand dollars for each subsequent offense
  within  an eighteen-month period. For the purpose of imposing a criminal
  fine or civil penalty pursuant to this subdivision, each receipt from  a
  separate  motor vehicle of department-marked material shall constitute a
  separate violation for which a criminal fine or  civil  penalty  may  be
  imposed.
    g.  Any  person  who  violates subdivision d of section 16-463 of this
  chapter shall be liable for (i) a criminal fine  of  one  thousand  five
  hundred  dollars  or  imprisonment  not  to exceed forty eight hours, or
  both, or (ii) a civil penalty of one thousand five hundred  dollars  for
  the first offense and three thousand dollars for each subsequent offense
  within any eighteen-month period. For the purpose of imposing a criminal
  fine  or civil penalty pursuant to this subdivision, each receipt from a
  separate motor vehicle of a refrigerant-containing item shall constitute
  a separate violation for which a criminal fine or civil penalty  may  be
  imposed.
    h.  The  provisions of this chapter may be enforced by the department,
  the police department,  the  department  of  consumer  affairs  and  the
  business integrity commission.
    i. Where a notice of violation is issued for a violation of any of the
  provisions  of  this  chapter,  such  process shall be returnable to the
  environmental control board or court of appropriate jurisdiction,  which
  shall  have  the  power  to  impose the civil penalties provided in this
  section.
