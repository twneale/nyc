    (2) In developing such plan, the department of small business services
  shall,  in  consultation with other city agencies, chambers of commerce,
  or other private organizations having expertise in  such  matters,  work
  with  small  business owners and non-profit organizations throughout New

  functioning of such small businesses and non-profit organizations during
  and after such events.
    (3)  The  plan  developed  or  updated in accordance with this section
  shall include but  need  not  be  limited  to  the  following  features,
  provided  that  nothing  herein shall be construed to interfere with the
  ability of agencies responding  to  an  emergency  to  implement  plans,
  modify  plans,  or  take  steps  not described in any written plan, in a
  manner appropriate to circumstances particular to that emergency: (i) an
  evaluation of the potential impact of disruptions  on  small  businesses
  and  non-profit  organizations  as  a result of such events, including a
  mechanism to conduct an impact analysis for major  categories  of  small
  businesses   and   non-profit   organizations,   as  determined  by  the
  commissioner  of  small  business  services,  in   order   to   identify
  disruptions  unique  to  each  such  category, and the implementation of
  measures to prevent or mitigate such disruptions and to support recovery
  of the small business and non-profit sectors; (ii) the establishment  of
  a  voluntary  database of small businesses and non-profit organizations,
  including but not limited to utilizing any existing  database  of  small
  businesses  and non-profit organizations maintained by the department of
  small  business  services,  to  provide   that   such   businesses   and
  organizations receive alerts regarding such events, recovery assistance,
  and  other  relevant information and to conduct outreach with such small
  businesses and non-profit organizations to encourage their  registration
  in such database; (iii) conducting a survey of small business owners and
  non-profit   organizations  after  such  events  to  identify  resources
  necessary for recovery, which shall include but not  be  limited  to  an
  assessment  of  small  businesses  such  as  whether a business is open,
  closed or partially in operation, damage to  business  facilities,  lost
  revenues,  the  number of employees affected and whether there is a plan
  for employees to return to such business if such employees are unable to
  work, whether additional workers are needed  or  hired  to  assist  with
  recovery  efforts, a description of the type of assistance necessary for
  recovery, the type and amount of insurance that such business  has,  and
  whether  such business has filed insurance claims and the status of such
  claims; (iv) strategies to inform such small businesses  and  non-profit
  organizations  about  how  to  obtain  such resources before, during and
  after such events; and (v) coordination  with  non-profit  organizations
  that  are capable of assisting small business owners with loan and grant
  applications,  and  business  counseling  services  to  facilitate   and
  expedite recovery.

  otherwise, with small businesses and  non-profit  organizations  as  set
  forth  in  this  section, shall be available in the most commonly spoken
