    &sect;  30-108  Traffic  management plan. The commissioner shall develop or
  update, no later than December first, two thousand thirteen,  a  traffic
  management  plan  in  consultation with other city agencies and relevant
  governmental entities, to be utilized during and  after  coastal  storms
  and  other  severe weather and natural disaster events where such events
  severely impact automotive, subway, and/or commuter train transportation
  in the city of New York. Such plan shall include but not be  limited  to
  the  following features, provided that nothing herein shall be construed
  to interfere with the ability of agencies responding to an emergency  to
  implement  plans,  modify  plans,  or  take  steps  not described in any
  written plan, in a manner appropriate  to  circumstances  particular  to
  that emergency:
    a.  the  installation  of  back-up power capability, including but not
  limited to the consideration of the effectiveness  of  installing  solar
  power and other alternative energy sources with respect to street lights
  and  traffic  control signals to keep the roadway network functioning to
  the maximum possible extent during power outages;
    b. alternative transportation options provided by governmental  and/or
  private  entities to be used in the event of subway service and/or major
  roadway shutdowns, including but not limited to expanded bus  and  ferry
  service;
    c.  alternative bus routing, including but not limited to criteria for
  the closing of streets to all traffic except buses;
    d. the expanded use of vehicles licensed by  the  taxi  and  limousine
  commission;
    e.  some  accessible  transportation  options for persons with special
  needs;
    f. closing or partially closing certain streets  or  designating  that
  one  or  more  lanes  of  traffic  on such streets are closed to traffic
  except  for  emergency  vehicles  and/or  vehicles  driven  by   certain
  individuals involved in rescue, recovery and clean-up operations;
    g.   where   appropriate,   recommending   to  the  appropriate  state
  transportation authorities the elimination  or  reduction  of  fares  on
  buses, subways and ferries; and
    h.  a mechanism to provide that, to the extent practicable, all public
  communications, written or otherwise, are available in the most commonly
  spoken languages of affected communities.
