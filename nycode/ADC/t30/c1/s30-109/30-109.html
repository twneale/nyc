Section 30-109

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  30-109  Fuel  management  plan.  The  commissioner shall develop or
  update, no later than December first,  two  thousand  thirteen,  a  fuel
  management  plan  in  consultation  with  other  city agencies and other
  relevant governmental entities, to be utilized during and after  coastal
  storms  and  other severe weather and natural disaster events where such
  events may disrupt or have disrupted the fuel supply in the city of  New
  York.    Such  plan  shall  include  but not be limited to the following
  features, provided that nothing herein shall be construed  to  interfere
  with  the  ability  of  agencies responding to an emergency to implement
  plans, modify plans, or take steps not described in any written plan, in
  a manner appropriate to circumstances particular to that emergency:
    a. the procedures and criteria for determining when  a  fuel  shortage
  exists  and for rationing of fuel in the event of a fuel shortage in the
  city of New York;
    b. the criteria for determining the amount of  fuel  reserves  in  the
  city  of  New  York  that  should  be  maintained  and for what priority
  purposes;
    c. the establishment and maintenance of lines of communication between
  the city and the industries that provide fuel to the city of New York;
    d. the prioritization of fuel access for persons involved  in  rescue,
  recovery and clean-up operations, including but not limited to emergency
  services and critical health, public safety and sanitation personnel;
    e.  a  process  for  assessing  transportation  routes to maximize the
  delivery of fuel within the city of New York; and
    f. a mechanism to provide that, to the extent practicable, all  public
  communications, written or otherwise, are available in the most commonly
  spoken languages of affected communities.
