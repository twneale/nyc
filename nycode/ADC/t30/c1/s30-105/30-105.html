Section 30-105

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  30-105  Sheltering  plan.  The  commissioner,  in consultation with
  relevant federal, state and local agencies, shall develop  or  update  a
  sheltering  plan  no  later  than December first, two thousand thirteen,
  that  anticipates  the  operation  of  shelters  for  short,  medium  or
  long-term periods of time as a result of coastal storms and other severe
  weather and natural disaster events. Such plan shall include, but not be
  limited to the following features, provided that nothing herein shall be
  construed  to  interfere  with  the ability of agencies responding to an
  emergency to implement plans, modify plans, or take steps not  described
  in any written plan, in a manner appropriate to circumstances particular
  to that emergency:
    a.  a  description  of  the  types of evacuation centers and shelters,
  number and location of evacuation centers, how persons  are  transferred
  from  an  evacuation  center  to  a shelter, and a mechanism to identify
  locations to be used as shelters, including shelters that  are  adequate
  for habitability for long-term stays;
    b. a description of shelter staffing and management, including but not
  limited  to  an  explanation  of how key shelter staff positions such as
  shelter managers and clinical staff will be determined and how  shelters
  will  be adequately staffed with trained medical personnel to the extent
  necessary for each such shelter's needs;
    c. a mechanism for clearly identifying to  residents,  volunteers  and
  other  staff at each shelter the individuals filling key staff positions
  at such shelter;
    d. a mechanism to provide that to the extent practicable  any  shelter
  manager  coordinates with a shelter manager on the immediately following
  shift  at  such  shelter  regarding  requests  for   supplies,   shelter
  conditions and other significant issues at such shelter;
    e.  a  mechanism  to  provide that there is adequate food and water at
  every shelter and that food options other than shelf  stable  items  and
  meals  ready to eat are available at any such shelter that is to be used
  for long term stays;
    f. a reassessment of the emergency shelter supply stockpile  at  least
  annually,  as  well  as  immediately  before  and  after  such  plan  is
  activated, to determine whether appropriate supplies are  available  and
  adequate;
    g. to the extent practicable, a plan for shower and laundry facilities
  for persons who remain in shelters after three days;
    h.  a  mechanism  for  tracking  the  daily  census  at  each shelter,
  including the number of persons with special medical needs,  the  number
  of persons who enter and exit each day, and to the extent practicable, a
  general description of the locations to which such persons exited;
    i.  a  mechanism to track the medical needs of persons at shelters who
  request assistance in meeting such needs, including but not  limited  to
  needed medications and placement in the proper type of shelter;
    j.  a  mechanism  to advise persons who receive federal, state or city
  public assistance benefits of how to avoid disruption of  such  benefits
  due  to  an  inability to meet program requirements as a result of their
  stay in such shelter;
    k. a mechanism to provide that all shelters are made usable to persons
  with disabilities to the extent practicable and to  identify  facilities
  in the shelter system that are accessible to persons with disabilities;
    l.  a  description  of how persons, including those with disabilities,
  are assigned to shelter facilities; and
    m. a mechanism to consult community based  organizations  and  service
  providers  with  relevant expertise in regard to the development of such
  plan.
