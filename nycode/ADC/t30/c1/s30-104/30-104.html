Section 30-104

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  30-104 Food and water access plan. In consultation with appropriate
  federal, state, and city government  agencies,  the  commissioner  shall
  develop  or update, no later than December first, two thousand thirteen,
  a food and water access plan to be utilized  after  coastal  storms  and
  other  severe  weather and natural disaster events where such events may
  disrupt access to food and water or may impact the ability to  purchase,
  prepare  or  consume  food or water. Such plan shall include, but not be
  limited to the following features, provided that nothing herein shall be
  construed to interfere with the ability of  agencies  responding  to  an
  emergency  to implement plans, modify plans, or take steps not described
  in any written plan, in a manner appropriate to circumstances particular
  to that emergency:
    a. a description of how the city  will  provide  access  to  food  and
  water, including but not limited to how and to what extent the city will
  disseminate information to the public about the availability of food and
  water   services;   manage   requests   for   support   from  emergency,
  not-for-profit entities that provide food  and  water;  arrange  for  or
  coordinate  disaster  feeding;  coordinate  the efforts of food benefits
  programs, food donations, food business and  emergency  food  providers;
  and  work to restore the public, private and non-profit sectors' ability
  to provide access to food and water;
    b. a mechanism to assess the city's food and water needs prior to  and
  after such conditions and incidents arise;
    c.   a   description   of  how  the  city  personnel  responsible  for
  implementing such  plan  will  be  identified,  including  how  a  clear
  hierarchy and points of contact of such personnel will be established;
    d.  criteria for how food and water distribution points are identified
  and how such distribution points will be publicized to ensure  that  the
  public is aware of the locations of such distribution points;
    e.  a  mechanism  to  provide  that  recipients  of food benefits have
  continued access to such benefits  during  and  immediately  after  such
  events   and   that  affected  communities  experiencing  transportation
  disruptions can access emergency food benefits locally;
    f. identification of contracts, if any, that can be  activated  during
  and  immediately  after  such  events  for  vendors that can provide and
  distribute food and water,  including  but  not  limited  to,  hot  food
  providers, trucks and drivers;
    g.  criteria  for  assessing  transportation routes that allow for the
  distribution of food and water that  accounts  for  emergency  road  and
  bridge closures;
    h.  a mechanism to provide that, to the extent practicable, all public
  communications, written or otherwise, are available in the most commonly
  spoken languages of affected communities; and
    i. a mechanism to consult community based  organizations  and  service
  providers  with  relevant expertise in regard to the development of such
  plan.
