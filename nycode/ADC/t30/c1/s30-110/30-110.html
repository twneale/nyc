    &sect;   30-110  Special  medical  needs  shelters.  The  commissioner,  in
  consultation with relevant federal,  state  and  local  agencies,  shall
  develop  or  update  a  plan  no later than December first, two thousand
  thirteen for the tracking of persons in special medical  needs  shelters
  established  as  a result of coastal storms and other severe weather and
  natural disaster events. Such plan shall include but not be  limited  to
  the  following features, provided that nothing herein shall be construed
  to interfere with the ability of agencies responding to an emergency  to
  implement  plans,  modify  plans,  or  take  steps  not described in any
  written plan, in a manner appropriate  to  circumstances  particular  to
  that emergency:
    a. a mechanism to adequately track persons who enter or exit a special
  medical needs shelter;
    b.  a  mechanism  for the dissemination of bracelets or other wearable
  identification devices to be used on a voluntary  basis  by  any  person
  entering  a  special  medical  needs shelter if such device has not been
  provided by the state, which shall include to the  extent  permitted  by
  state  and  federal  law  such person's name, address, emergency contact
  information, and information provided regarding  the  medical  needs  of
  such  person,  or an identification number or other identifier that will
  enable the shelter operator to locate such information;
    c. a mechanism to track the  medical  needs  of  any  person  using  a
  special medical needs shelter if such mechanism has not been provided by
  the  state and to the extent information regarding such medical needs is
  available, including but not limited to needed medications;
    d. a mechanism for enabling persons  who  use  special  medical  needs
  shelters  and  who  do  not object to disclosure of their location to be
  contacted  by  their  family  members  and  guardians,   including   the
  establishment  of a designated point of contact for such information and
  a description of how such mechanism will be publicized; and
    e. a  mechanism  for  consulting  community  based  organizations  and
  service  providers with relevant expertise, including but not limited to
  those representing the interests of  individuals  with  special  medical
  needs, in regard to the development of such plan.
