    &sect;  30-111  Plan  for outreach and recovery to vulnerable and homebound
  individuals. The commissioner, in consultation  with  relevant  federal,
  state  and  local  agencies,  shall  develop  or  update,  no later than
  December first, two thousand thirteen, an outreach and recovery plan  to
  assist  vulnerable  and  homebound  individuals before, during and after
  coastal storms and other severe weather  and  natural  disaster  events.
  Such  plan  shall  include but not be limited to the following features,
  provided that nothing herein shall be construed to  interfere  with  the
  ability  of  agencies  responding  to  an  emergency to implement plans,
  modify plans, or take steps not described in  any  written  plan,  in  a
  manner appropriate to circumstances particular to that emergency:
    a. a description of how the office will identify, conduct outreach to,
  communicate   with,   and  otherwise  assist  vulnerable  and  homebound
  individuals before, during and after the impact of such events;
    b. the development of a mechanism for utilizing lists of homebound and
  vulnerable  individuals,  to  the  extent  consistent  with   applicable
  confidentiality  requirements,  which  shall  include:  (1)  the  use of
  existing  lists  of  such  individuals  maintained  by  community  based
  organizations,  service  providers  and relevant agencies, including but
  not limited to the department for the aging, the  department  of  health
  and  mental  hygiene,  the department of social services/human resources
  administration, and  the  New  York  city  housing  authority;  (2)  the
  office's  Advance  Warning System or successor system; and (3) a process
  whereby vulnerable and homebound individuals receive  information  about
  how to request that they be included in such existing lists or system;
    c.  a  description  of  how  the  office will coordinate with relevant
  agencies, community based organizations and service providers to  assist
  such individuals before, during and after the impact of such events;
    d.  the creation of a Door-to-Door Task Force that will be responsible
  for  developing  and  implementing  a  strategy  to  locate  and  assist
  vulnerable  and  homebound  individuals,  provide  such individuals with
  information, and assist with any recovery efforts that take place  after
  such events, including the delivery of necessary supplies and services;
    e.   a   description  of  how  information,  supplies,  services,  and
  transportation will be made available to such individuals to  facilitate
  the relocation of such individuals if necessary;
    f.  a mechanism to provide that, to the extent practicable, all public
  communications, written or otherwise, are available in the most commonly
  spoken languages of affected communities; and
    g. a  mechanism  for  consulting  community  based  organizations  and
  service  providers with relevant expertise, including but not limited to
  those  representing  the   interests   of   homebound   and   vulnerable
  individuals, in regard to the development of such plan.
