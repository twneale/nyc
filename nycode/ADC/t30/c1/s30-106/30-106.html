  interfere  with  the  ability  of agencies responding to an emergency to
  implement plans, modify plans,  or  take  steps  not  described  in  any
  written  plan,  in  a  manner appropriate to circumstances particular to
  that emergency event:
    a. the  establishment  of  community  recovery  directors  and  deputy
  recovery  directors or other such similar positions for each of the five
  boroughs, where appropriate for the geographic impact of  the  emergency
  event, including:
    (1)  the  criteria  for  how  such  directors,  deputies or other such
  similar positions are chosen; and
    (2) a description of the basic duties  and  responsibilities  of  such
  directors,  deputies  or other such similar positions including, but not
  limited to: the timing of deployment in the field following such events;
  how such director and deputies or other such similar positions  will  be
  responsible  to  act as the main points of contact for providing general
  services and fulfilling  the  most  critical  needs  of  individuals  in
  impacted  areas;  how  such  director,  deputies  or  other such similar
  positions will work with federal and  state  representatives  to  assist
  impacted individuals with access to emergency disaster benefits; and how
  such  director,  deputies or other such similar positions will work with
  community based  organizations,  service  providers  and  volunteers  in
  recovery assistance operations;
    b.  a  description  of ways to leverage the participation of community
  based organizations, service providers, and volunteers with the goal  of
  commencing  a  unified  recovery  assistance  operation  as  rapidly  as
  possible;
    c. a description of ways to leverage federal and state resources in an
  expedited manner to provide that resources from all levels of government
  become available as soon as practicable after such events take place;
    d. the creation of a uniform information sharing and distribution plan
  to be used by  each  community  recovery  director  to  properly  inform
  residents,  elected officials and the press about the services available
  through the community recovery director and  his  or  her  team  on  the
  ground, and ways to contact community recovery personnel;
    e.  the  establishment  of  field recovery offices in or near affected
  communities as soon as practicable after such events take place;
    f. a description  of  how  the  administrative  and  functional  items
  necessary  for  immediate  and  successful  operation  of field recovery
  offices will be established; and
    g. an information dissemination strategy that identifies and  utilizes
  major  hubs and distribution centers, including partnering with non-city
  distribution sites, to share information  about  services  available  to
  clients,  elected  officials,  and  press, and that requires that to the
  extent practicable, all public communications, written or otherwise, are
  available in the most commonly spoken languages of affected communities.
