Section 16-514

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;   16-514   Emergency   suspension   of   license   or  registration.
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter or rules promulgated
  thereto, the commission may, upon a determination that the operation  of
  the  business  of  a  licensee  or  the  removal  of waste by a business
  required by this chapter to be registered creates an imminent danger  to
  life  or property, or upon a finding that there has likely been false or
  fraudulent information submitted in an application pursuant  to  section
  16-507  or  section  16-508  of  this  chapter, immediately suspend such
  license or registration without a prior hearing, provided that provision
  shall be made for an immediate appeal of such suspension to the chair of
  the commission who shall determine such appeal forthwith. In  the  event
  that  the  chair  upholds  the  suspension, an opportunity for a hearing
  shall be provided on an expedited basis, within a period not  to  exceed
  four  business days and the commission shall issue a final determination
  no later than four days following the conclusion of such hearing.
