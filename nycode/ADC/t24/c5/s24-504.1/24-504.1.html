  debris  in the city sanitation system, including the ability of effluent
  chlorination to disinfect the medical debris;
    4. the feasibility and cost of  separating  the  medical  debris  from
  other sewage treatment plant debris before disposal;
    5. the feasibility and cost of alternative disposal methods; and
    6.  a  strategy for eliminating or mitigating the deposit and disposal
  of this medical debris in the city sewerage and sanitation systems.
