  opportunities,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  incentives,  such as
  expedited permitting and property tax  relief,  for  infill,  brownfield
  redevelopment  and  other  environmentally  beneficial  development, and
  disincentives, such as stricter development guidelines, for  development
  that may adversely impact Jamaica bay;
    (4)  a  protocol  for coordination with appropriate federal, state and
  city governmental entities that have jurisdiction over the  Jamaica  bay
  area,  with  respect  to,  but  not  limited  to, efforts to restore and
  maintain the water quality and ecological integrity of Jamaica  bay  and
  notification  regarding proposed development projects within the Jamaica
  bay watershed/sewershed that may adversely impact Jamaica bay;
    (5) a protocol for coordination with the  office  of  operations  that
  ensures  that  environmental  assessments and reviews of projects within

  bay and are conducted pursuant to all applicable federal, state and city
  environmental quality review laws and regulations;
    (6) a  public  education  program,  including,  but  not  limited  to,

  and other local organizations and entities to increase  awareness  about
  the  ecological  significance  and degradation of Jamaica bay; potential
  threats to Jamaica bay; restoration and watershed stewardship activities
  undertaken by the department  and  others  involving  Jamaica  bay;  and
  methods and practices to reduce pollution in Jamaica bay; and
    (7)  a  program  to  target  enforcement efforts that will help reduce
