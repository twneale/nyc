    &sect;   24-503   Drainage  plan.  a.  The  commissioner  of  environmental
  protection shall devise and prepare a plan for the proper  sewerage  and
  drainage  of the city, so far as the same has not already been done, for
  the purpose of thoroughly draining and  carrying  off  water  and  other
  matter. He or she shall lay out the city into as many sewerage districts
  as  he  or  she may deem necessary for such purpose, and shall determine
  and show, on suitable maps or plans:
    1. The location, course, size  and  grade  of  each  sewer  and  drain
  proposed for each of such districts;
    2.  The contemplated depth of such sewers and drains below the present
  surface and below the established grades of streets and avenues;
    3. The proposed alterations and improvements in existing sewers;
    4. Such other particulars as may  be  necessary  for  the  purpose  of
  exhibiting a complete plan of the proposed sewerage therein.
    b.  Such  plan  shall  indicate  the  location  and size of all sewage
  disposal works or plants, and the necessary  appurtenances  thereto,  as
  determined by the department of environmental protection.
    c.  The commissioner of environmental protection shall submit such map
  or plan simultaneously to the department of health and  mental  hygiene,
  the  director  of  city  planning, each affected community board and the
  office of the appropriate borough president. The  department  of  health
  and  mental  hygiene  shall  review such map or plan with respect to the
  creation or abatement of any health hazard. Such department shall file a
  statement with the commissioner  of  environmental  protection  and  the
  director  of  city  planning,  in  relation  to such map or plan, within
  fifteen  days  subsequent  to  such  submission  either   approving   or
  disapproving such map or plan.
    d.  The  director  of  city  planning  shall  review and determine the
  conformance of such map or plan with the  city  map,  as  adopted.  Upon
  determination  that  such  map  or plan conforms with the city map, such
  director  shall  certify  such  determination  to  the  commissioner  of
  environmental  protection.  Unless  the  director shall file a statement
  with such commissioner in relation to such map  or  plan  within  thirty
  days  subsequent to the submission of said map or plan, such map or plan
  shall be deemed to conform with the city map and  shall  constitute  the
  certification thereof.
    e.  Copies  of  such  map  or  plan as approved in accordance with the
  provisions of this  section  shall  be  filed  by  the  commissioner  of
  environmental  protection in each county office of record, the community
  board for the community in which any portion of  such  map  or  plan  is
  situated and the office of the borough president in which any portion of
  such  map  or  plan  is  situated within the city of New York and in the
  offices of the department of transportation and department of health and
  mental hygiene of such city.
