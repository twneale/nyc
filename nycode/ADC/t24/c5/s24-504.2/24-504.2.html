    &sect;  24-504.2  Combined Sewer Overflow and Floatables, Including Medical
  Debris, Study. a. The department  shall,  within  eight  months  of  the
  effective  date  of  this  section, complete an analysis of the combined
  sewer outfall system  and  its  relationship  to  floatables,  including
  medical  debris,  discharged  through the system, which are deposited on
  beaches and other shorelines throughout the city.  This  analysis  shall
  include, but not be limited to, identifying, evaluating and providing:
    1.  The  location  of each combined sewer regulator and outfall within
  the city of New York;
    2. A list identifying priority combined sewer regulators, specifically
  indicating those which discharge within five hundred feet of  designated
  bathing areas;
    3.  The  general  composition  and  quantity  of floatables, including
  medical debris, that are discharged from the combined sewer  system,  to
  be compiled from available data;
    4.  Environmental  impacts of floatables, including medical debris, to
  be compiled from available data;
    5. The long-term solutions to be advanced to reduce the  discharge  of
  floatables,  including  medical debris, from combined sewer systems onto
  beaches and shorelines throughout the city,  and  the  costs  associated
  with these efforts;
    6. A quarterly report about the status of this debris, as evidenced by
  the  city-wide  floatables  study,  which  shall  include any short-term
  collection  and  containment  methods   discovered,   which   could   be
  implemented  in  order  to  reduce  the discharge of floatables from the
  combined sewer system onto beaches and shorelines throughout  the  city,
  and the proposed costs associated with these efforts.
    b.  The  commissioner shall, within eight months of the effective date
  of this section, submit to the council a report on the findings of  such
  analysis  and  any  recommendations  as  to  regulations  or legislation
  necessary to implement the recommendations of the analysis.
