    &sect;   24-151  Emission  of  air  contaminant;  concealment  and  masking
  restricted. (a) No person shall cause or permit the installation or  use
  of  any  device  or  use  of  any  means  which,  without resulting in a
  reduction in the total amount of air contaminant  emitted,  conceals  an
  emission of the air contaminant which would otherwise violate subchapter
  six of this code.
    (b)  No  person  shall  cause or permit the installation or use of any
  device or use of any means designed to  mask  the  emission  of  an  air
  contaminant which causes or may cause detriment to the health, safety or
  welfare of any person.
