    (b) If the allegation in the notice of violation is one  for  which  a

  contested, then the respondent must either:
    (1) Include a copy of any permit or certificate  that  the  respondent
  asserts was issued by the department; or
    (2) Deny that such permit or certificate is required by law.
    (c) If any of the allegations in the notice of violation are those for
  which  a  hearing  is  required  by section 24-178 of this code, and are
  contested, the written response shall contain a concise statement of the
  facts constituting each ground of defense.
    (d) If allegations in  the  notice  of  violation  are  admitted,  the
  written response of the respondent shall consist of:
    (1)  A statement that he or she admits all of the material allegations
  to be true; and
    (2) A statement of any attempts subsequent to service of the notice of
  violation to comply with this code or with the order or regulation.
    (e) Failure of the respondent to serve a written response  within  the
  time provided shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of his or her right
  to appear and contest the allegations in the notice.
