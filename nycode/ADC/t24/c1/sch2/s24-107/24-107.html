Section 24-107

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 24-107 Testing by order of commissioner. (a) If the commissioner has
  reasonable  cause  to believe that any equipment or fuel is in violation
  of this code, the commissioner may order the owner of the  equipment  or
  fuel  to  conduct  such  tests  as  are  necessary in the opinion of the
  commissioner to determine whether the equipment, its operation,  or  the
  fuel  is  in  violation  of  this  code, or whether material used in any
  manufacturing process is contributing to any violation of this code  and
  to submit the test results to the commissioner within ten days after the
  tests are completed.
    (b)  Such  tests  shall  be  conducted  in  a  manner  approved by the
  commissioner. The test shall be certified by a laboratory acceptable  to
  the  commissioner.  The  entire  test  results  shall  be  reviewed  and
  certified by a professional engineer.
    (c) The owner shall notify the commissioner of the time and place of a
  test  at  least  seven  days  before  the  commencement  of  such  test.
  Reasonable  facilities  shall  be made available for the commissioner to
  witness the test.
    (d) If in the opinion of the commissioner tests by the department  are
  necessary,  the  commissioner  may  order  the owner to provide sampling
  holes at such points in the stack, conduit, flue, duct or vent,  as  the
  commissioner  may reasonably request, to provide a power source suitable
  to the points of testing, and to provide allied facilities, exclusive of
  sampling and sensory devices. These provisions  shall  be  made  at  the
  expense of the owner of the equipment. The owner shall be furnished with
  copies of the analytical results of the samples collected.
