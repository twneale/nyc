    b. Diesel fuel-powered school buses shall utilize a  closed  crankcase

  identified  and  approved  as  part  of  the  diesel  retrofit  verified
  technologies  list  by the United States environmental protection agency
  or the list of currently verified diesel emission control strategies  by
  the  California  air  resources board, to reduce engine emissions to the
  school bus cabin, in accordance with the following schedule:
    (1) fifty percent of diesel fuel-powered school buses used to  fulfill
  each  school bus contract shall be equipped with such a closed crankcase
  ventilation system by September 1, 2010;
    (2) one hundred percent of diesel fuel-powered school  buses  used  to
  fulfill  each  school  bus contract shall be equipped with such a closed
  crankcase ventilation system by September 1, 2011;
    c. Diesel fuel-powered school buses shall not be used to  fulfill  any
  school  bus  contract beyond the end of the sixteenth year from the date
  of manufacture, as noted on the vehicle registration, or the end of  the
  school year in which that date falls, whichever is later.
    d.  School  buses  shall be replaced pursuant to subdivision c of this
  section with (1) a school bus meeting  the  most  recent  diesel  engine
  emissions standards issued by the United States environmental protection
  agency,  or  (2)  an  all-electric, gasoline-powered, compressed natural
