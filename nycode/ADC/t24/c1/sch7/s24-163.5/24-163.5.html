  commissioner for  a  nonroad  vehicle,  for  reducing  the  emission  of
  pollutants  that  achieves reductions in particulate matter emissions at
  the highest classification level for diesel emission control strategies,
  as set forth in subdivision d of this section, that is applicable to the
  particular engine and application. Such  technology  shall  also,  at  a
  reasonable cost, achieve the greatest reduction in emissions of nitrogen
  oxides  at such particulate matter reduction level and shall in no event
  result in a net increase in the emissions of either  particulate  matter
  or nitrogen oxides.
    (2)  "City  agency"  means  a  city,  county, borough, administration,
  department, division, bureau, board or  commission,  or  a  corporation,

  finding,  which  is  approved,  in  writing, by the commissioner, that a
  sufficient quantity of ultra low sulfur diesel fuel, or diesel fuel that
  has a sulfur content of no more than thirty parts per  million  where  a
  determination is in effect pursuant to subdivision f of this section, is
  not  available  to  meet the requirements of this section, provided that
  the contractor, to the extent practicable, shall use  whatever  quantity
  of ultra low sulfur diesel fuel or diesel fuel that has a sulfur content
  of  no  more  than  thirty parts per million is available for its diesel
  fuel-powered vehicles. Any waiver issued pursuant  to  this  subdivision
  shall  expire  after  two  months,  unless  the  city  agency renews the
  finding, in writing, and the  commissioner  approves  such  renewal,  in
  writing.
    h.  The  commissioner  may  issue  a  waiver  for  the use of the best
  available retrofit technology by a diesel fuel-powered motor vehicle  or
  diesel  fuel-powered  nonroad  vehicle  where  the  city agency that has
  entered into the applicable solid waste contract or recyclable materials
  contract makes a written finding, which is approved, in writing, by  the
  commissioner,  that such technology is unavailable for purchase for such
  vehicle, in which case the contractor  shall  be  required  to  use  the
  technology  for  reducing  the  emission of pollutants that would be the
  next best best available retrofit technology and that is  available  for
  purchase   for   such  vehicle.  Any  waiver  issued  pursuant  to  this
  subdivision shall expire after three years. The commissioner  shall  not
  renew  any  waiver  issued pursuant to this subdivision after January 1,
