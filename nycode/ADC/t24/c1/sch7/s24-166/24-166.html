    &sect;  24-166  Use  of  combustion  shutoff;  halting  of  emission of air
  contaminant. (a) Whenever the use of a combustion shutoff is required by
  this  code  or  by  the  commissioner,  the  combustion   shutoff   must
  automatically  halt  the  operation of fuel burning equipment using fuel
  oil within two minutes after the emission of an  air  contaminant  of  a
  density  which  appears  darker  than  number  one on the standard smoke
  chart, or of an opacity which obscures vision to a degree  greater  than
  smoke of number one density on the standard smoke chart.
    (b)  No  person  shall  cause  or  permit the resumption of the normal
  operation of the fuel burning equipment whose operation was halted by  a
  combustion  shutoff  until the equipment operates in accordance with the
  standards of this code.
