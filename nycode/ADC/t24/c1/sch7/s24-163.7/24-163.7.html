    &sect;  24-163.7  Use  of  ultra  low sulfur diesel fuel and best available
  retrofit technology in school bus transportation.  a.  Definitions.  For
  the  purposes  of  this section only, the following terms shall have the
  following meanings:
    (1) "Best available retrofit technology" means technology, verified by
  the United States environmental protection agency or the California  air
  resources  board,  for reducing the emission of pollutants that achieves
  reductions in particulate matter emissions at the highest classification
  level  for  diesel  emission  control  strategies,  as  set   forth   in
  subdivision  e  of  this  section,  that is applicable to the particular
  engine and application. Such technology  shall  also,  at  a  reasonable
  cost,  achieve the greatest reduction in emissions of nitrogen oxides at
  such particulate matter reduction level and shall in no event result  in
  a net increase in the emissions of either particulate matter or nitrogen
  oxides.
    (2)  "Department  of  education" means the New York city department of
  education, formerly known as the New York city board of  education,  and
  any  successor  agency or entity thereto, the expenses of which are paid
  in whole or in part from the city treasury.
    (3) "Person" means any natural  person,  partnership,  firm,  company,
  association, joint stock association, corporation or other legal entity.
    (4) "Reasonable cost" means that such technology does not cost greater
  than  thirty  percent  more  than  other  technology  applicable  to the
  particular  engine  and  application  that   falls   within   the   same
  classification  level  for  diesel  emission  control strategies, as set
  forth in subdivision e of this section, when considering the cost of the
  strategies, themselves, and the cost of installation.
    (5) "School bus" means any vehicle operated pursuant to a  school  bus
  contract, designed to transport ten or more children at one time, of the
  designation  "Type  C  bus"  or "Type D bus" as set forth in 17 NYCRR &sect;&sect;
  720.1(Z) and (AA), and used to transport children to or from any  school
  located  in  the  city  of  New York, and excluding any vehicle utilized
  primarily to transport children with special educational  needs  who  do
  not  travel  to  and  from  school in vehicles used to transport general
  education students.
    (6) "School bus contract" means any agreement between any  person  and
  the department of education to transport children on a school bus.
    (7) "Ultra low sulfur diesel fuel" means diesel fuel that has a sulfur
  content of no more than fifteen parts per million.
    b. (1) Beginning July 1, 2006, any diesel fuel-powered school bus that
  is  operated  by  a  person who fuels such school bus at any facility at
  which ultra low sulfur diesel fuel is available, or of which such person
  has the exclusive use and control, or  at  which  such  person  has  the
  ability  to  specify  the fuel to be made available, shall be powered by
  ultra low sulfur diesel fuel.
    (2) Beginning September 1, 2006, any diesel fuel-powered school bus to
  which paragraph one of this subdivision does not apply shall be  powered
  by ultra low sulfur diesel fuel.
    c.  Diesel  fuel-powered school buses shall utilize the best available
  retrofit technology in accordance with the following schedule:
    i. 50% of school buses used to fulfill each  school  bus  contract  by
  September 1, 2006;
    ii.  100%  of school buses used to fulfill each school bus contract by
  September 1, 2007.
    d. (1) The commissioner shall make determinations, and shall publish a
  list containing such determinations, as to the best  available  retrofit
  technology to be used for each type of diesel fuel-powered school bus to
  which  this  section  applies. Each such determination shall be reviewed

  and revised, as needed, on a regular basis, but in no event  less  often
  than once every six months.
    (2)  No  person  shall  be required to replace best available retrofit
  technology  or  other  authorized  technology  utilized  for  a   diesel
  fuel-powered  school  bus  in  accordance  with  the  provisions of this
  section within three years of having first utilized such technology  for
  such bus, except that technology that falls within Level 4, as set forth

  until it has reached the end of its useful life.
    (3) For purposes of this  subdivision,  any  best  available  retrofit
  technology,  or substantially similar technology, purchased or installed
  in whole or in part with funds provided by the state of New York or  the
  federal  government  pursuant  to  a specific diesel emissions reduction
  program in effect upon the date of  enactment  of  this  section,  shall
  constitute  the  best  available retrofit technology for a period of not
  less than three  years  from  the  date  on  which  such  equipment  was
  installed.
    e.  The  classification  levels for diesel emission control strategies
  are as follows, with Level 4 being the highest classification level:
    i. Level 4 - strategy reduces diesel particulate matter  emissions  by
  85  percent or greater or reduces engine emissions to less than or equal
  to 0.01 grams diesel particulate matter per brake horsepower-hour;
    ii. Level 3 - strategy reduces diesel particulate matter emissions  by
  between 50 and 84 percent;
    iii. Level 2 - strategy reduces diesel particulate matter emissions by
  between 25 and 49 percent;
    iv.  Level 1 - strategy reduces diesel particulate matter emissions by
  between 20 and 24 percent.
    f. The commissioner shall issue a written determination  that  permits
  the  use of diesel fuel that has a sulfur content of no more than thirty
  parts per million to fulfill the requirements of subdivision b  of  this
  section  if  ultra  low  sulfur diesel fuel is not available to meet the
  needs of school buses to fulfill the requirements of this section.  Such
  determination  shall  expire  after  six  months and shall be renewed in
  writing every  six  months  thereafter  if  such  lack  of  availability
  persists, but in no event shall be in effect after September 1, 2006.
