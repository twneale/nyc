Section 24-163.10

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  24-163.10  Use of auxiliary power units in ambulances. a. When used
  in this section, "auxiliary power unit" means a device located on or  in
  a  vehicle  that  supplies cooling, heating and electrical power to such
  vehicle while the vehicle's engine is turned off. Not later than January
  first, two thousand fourteen, the  fire  department  shall  develop  and
  implement  a  pilot  project  for  a period of not less than one year to
  ascertain the benefits and  reliability  of  utilizing  auxiliary  power
  units in ambulances operated by the city of New York. Such pilot project
  shall  employ  auxiliary power units to power the ambulance's electrical
  load, diagnostic devices,  ancillary  electrical  equipment,  tools  and
  cabin  temperature  without the need to engage the engine or use another
  source of power.
    b.  Not  later  than  July  first,  two  thousand  fifteen,  the  fire
  department  shall  submit  a  report to the mayor and the speaker of the
  council detailing the findings of such pilot project, including but  not
  limited  to  data  on  actual  reduction  in  vehicular emissions, and a
  cost-benefit analysis for equipping  the  entire  ambulance  fleet  with
  auxiliary power units.
