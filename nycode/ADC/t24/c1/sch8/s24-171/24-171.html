Section 24-171

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  24-171  Sulfur  exemption certificates. (a) Except for fuel burning
  equipment that must comply with the sulfur dioxide emission standards of
  section 24-144 of this code, the commissioner may grant a certificate of
  exemption from the sulfur content restrictions of section 24-169 of this
  code  if  the  applicant  establishes  to  the   satisfaction   of   the
  commissioner  that  the  fuel  burning  equipment  is operated in such a
  manner, or is equipped with such control apparatus, as  to  continuously
  prevent  the  emission  of any sulfur compound or compounds in an amount
  greater than that which would have  been  emitted  from  the  same  fuel
  burning  equipment,  if  operated,  in the absence of control apparatus,
  using fuel which  complies  with  the  sulfur  content  restrictions  of
  section 24-169 of this code.
    (b)  The  commissioner  may grant a temporary certificate of exemption
  from the sulfur content restrictions of section 24-169 of this code,  if
  the  applicant  establishes to the satisfaction of the commissioner that
  the application  is  for  the  purpose  of  conducting  an  experimental
  operation prior to application for a sulfur exemption certificate.
    (c)  A  sulfur  exemption certificate shall be valid for one year from
  the date  granted  or  renewed,  unless  sooner  suspended  or  revoked.
  Application  for renewal shall be made by the holder of the certificate,
  and shall be postmarked, or where personally delivered, date stamped  by
  the  department no later than ninety days prior to the expiration of the
  certificate. The commissioner may renew a sulfur  exemption  certificate
  if  he  or  she  is  satisfied  that the provisions of this code and the
  conditions and terms contained in the certificate will be met.
    (d) Any sulfur exemption certificate  or  temporary  sulfur  exemption
  certificate  issued by the commissioner shall be limited to the kind and
  amount of fuel specified, and to use in the equipment described, and may
  be further limited as determined by the commissioner.
    (e) A separate application  for  a  sulfur  exemption  certificate  or
  temporary  sulfur  exemption  certificate shall be made for each unit of
  fuel burning equipment for which exemption is sought.
    (f) In addition to the conditions and limitations for the issuance  of
  a sulfur exemption certificate or temporary sulfur exemption certificate
  specified  in  this  section,  the commissioner may provide such further
  conditions or limitations as he or she may deem appropriate.
    (g) A temporary sulfur exemption certificate shall be valid for  three
  months  from  the  date  granted  or renewed, unless sooner suspended or
  revoked. The commissioner may renew a temporary certificate no more than
  once upon application which is postmarked or dated by the department  no
  later than fourteen days prior to the expiration of the certificate.
