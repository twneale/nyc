    &sect;  24-169  Sulfur  content  of fuel restricted. Except for ocean-going
  vessels engaged in international or interstate trade, no  person,  other

  the use, or if intended for use in New York city,  the  purchase,  sale,
  offer for sale, storage or transportation of:
    (a)  Fuel  oil  grade  no. 2 as classified by the American Society for
  Testing and Materials that contains more than 0.2 percent of  sulfur  by
  weight  and  after  June  30,  2012,  more  than the amount set forth in
  section 19-0325 of the environmental conservation law or as provided  by
  an executive order of the governor issued pursuant to such section.
    (b)  Residual  fuel  oil and fuel oil grade no. 4 as classified by the
  American Society for Testing and Materials or solid fuel on a dry  basis
  that contains more than the following percentages of sulfur by weight:
    (1) 0.30 percent and
    (2)  for  fuel  oil  grade no. 4 after October 1, 2012, more than 0.15
  percent, provided that the commissioner may waive  the  requirements  of
  this  paragraph  if the commissioner finds that there is an insufficient
  quantity of fuel oil grade no. 2  that  contains  no  more  than  0.0015
  percent  of  sulfur  by  weight.  Any  waiver  issued  pursuant  to this
  subdivision shall expire after three months, unless renewed  in  writing
  by  the  commissioner. The provisions of paragraph 1 of this subdivision
  shall apply during the period such waiver is in effect.
    (c) Residual fuel oil or fuel oil grade no. 4  as  classified  by  the

    (1)  For  a period ending October first, nineteen hundred seventy-one,
  one percent;
    (2) For a period ending October first, nineteen  hundred  seventy-two,
  an annual average of 0.55 percent;
    (3) After October first, nineteen hundred seventy-two, 0.30 percent.
    (d)  Those  facilities  burning  solid  fuel  which  are  operated  in
  compliance with this code may, at the discretion  of  the  commissioner,
  continue  to  burn  solid fuel containing up to 0.7 percent sulfur after
  October first, nineteen hundred seventy-one, provided that there  is  no
  increase  or  expansion  of  use  and  further  provided  that a report,
  satisfactory to the commissioner, is submitted setting forth a  detailed
  program,  including a specific time schedule, for the termination of use
  of such solid fuel.
    (e) Sulfur by weight  shall  be  calculated  by  the  methods  of  the
  American society for testing and materials.
