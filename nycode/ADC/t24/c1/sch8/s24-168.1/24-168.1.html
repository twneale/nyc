  where heating oil from a dual-use tank supplies both such boiler and  an
  emergency generator.
    (2)  The  commissioner  may authorize the use of any renewable fuel in
  heating systems if  he  or  she  determines  that  such  fuel  meets  an
  applicable  American Society for Testing and Materials standard or other
  standard as determined by the commissioner, and the emissions from  such
  fuel  contain  equal  or  lesser  amounts  of particulate matter, sulfur
  dioxide and nitrogen oxides than the emissions from fuel oil  grade  no.
  2.
    (c)  The  commissioner  may  waive  the requirements of paragraph 1 of
  subdivision b of this section in accordance with the provisions of  this
  subdivision.
    (1)  A waiver may be issued for a particular type of boiler or fuel if
  the commissioner finds that:

    (i) a sufficient quantity of bioheating fuel  containing  two  percent
  biodiesel is not available in the city for that boiler type;
    (ii) the price of available bioheating fuel for that boiler type is at
  least fifteen percent more than the price of a comparable fuel oil grade
  of one hundred percent petroleum heating oil;
    (iii)  the  use  of  bioheating  fuel  would  void  the manufacturer's
  warranty for that boiler type; or
    (iv) there is no applicable American Society of Testing and  Materials
  standard  or  other standard as determined by the commissioner to govern
  the specification of the bioheating fuel for purposes of receiving  bids
  and enforcing contracts.
    (2)  Any  waiver  issued  pursuant  to  subparagraph  (i)  or  (ii) of
  paragraph 1 of this subdivision shall expire after three months,  unless
  renewed in writing by the commissioner.
    (3)  Any  waiver  issued  pursuant  to  subparagraph  (iii) or (iv) of
  paragraph 1 of this subdivision shall expire after  six  months,  unless
  renewed in writing by the commissioner.
    (4) A waiver may be issued for a specific district steam system if the
  commissioner  finds  based  on documentation submitted by the applicant,
  including but not limited  to  a  report  certified  by  a  professional
  engineer,  that  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  paragraph 1 of
  subdivision b of this section would result in damage to  equipment  used
  to  generate  steam within such district steam system. Any waiver issued
  pursuant to this paragraph shall expire after one year,  unless  renewed
  in writing by the commissioner.
    (d)(1)  No later than September 1, 2013, and no later than September 1
