Section 24-608

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  24-608  Emergency  response. a. When the commissioner has reason to
  believe that there has been a release  or  there  exists  a  substantial
  threat  of a release into the environment of a hazardous substance which
  may present an immediate and substantial danger to the public health  or
  welfare  or  the  environment,  the  commissioner  may,  in  his  or her
  discretion, order any  or  all  responsible  persons  to  implement  any
  response  measures,  or to cooperate with and assist the commissioner in
  implementing any response measures, deemed by  the  commissioner  to  be
  necessary  to  protect  the public health or welfare or the environment,
  or, if the commissioner, in the  exercise  of  his  or  her  discretion,
  concludes  that seeking the implementation of any such response measures
  by a responsible person may be detrimental to public health  or  welfare
  or the environment due to the likelihood of delay or the ineffectiveness
  of  such  response  measures,  or  for any other appropriate reason, the
  commissioner may implement  such  response  measures.  The  commissioner
  shall,  where  appropriate, consult with the commissioner of health, the
  police commissioner and the fire commissioner concerning  the  need  for
  and   implementation   of   such   response  measures  and  orders.  The
  commissioner may also order the production  of  documents  relevant  for
  determining the nature and extent of the release or threat of release.
    b.  Nothing  in  this  subchapter  shall  be construed to preclude the
  implementation of response measures by any  other  city  agency,  either
  prior  or  subsequent  to  any  response measure implemented pursuant to
  subdivision a of this section.
