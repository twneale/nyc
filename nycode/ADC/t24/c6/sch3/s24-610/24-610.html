Section 24-610

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  24-610  Orders to responsible persons; civil and criminal penalties
  and imprisonment.
    a. (1) An order of the commissioner issued pursuant to  subdivision  a
  of section 24-608 shall specify the work to be performed and shall fix a
  reasonable  time  for compliance from the date of service of such order.
  Such  order  shall  contain  a  statement  that  upon  failure  of   the
  responsible  person  to  comply with the commissioner's order within the
  stated time, the department may perform the work specified in the  order
  or  apply  for  a court order directing the responsible person to comply
  with the commissioner's order.
    (2) (i) Service of such order  shall  be  made  upon  the  responsible
  person  personally  or  by certified or registered mail addressed to the
  last known address of such person or in any manner provided for  service
  of process by article three of the civil practice law and rules.
    (ii)  In  instances  where the commissioner knows that the responsible
  person served pursuant to subparagraph (i) of this paragraph is not  the
  owner  of  the property at which the response measures ordered are to be
  implemented, notice that such order has been served, and a copy of  such
  order,  shall  be  sent  by  both certified or registered mail and first
  class mail to the last known address of the person whose name appears on
  the records in the office of the city collector as being  the  owner  or
  agent  or as the person designated by the owner to receive tax bills or,
  where no name appears, to such property, addressed to either  the  owner
  or  the  agent.  Such  notice  shall  have  stamped or printed thereon a
  reference to this section. Any failure  to  provide  written  notice  as
  prescribed  by  this  subparagraph  shall  not  in  any  way  affect the
  liability of any person for the  cost  incurred  by  the  city  for  any
  response measures implemented in accordance with this chapter.
    (3)  A  copy  of  such  order  shall  be  filed with the office of the
  register in the county in which is situated the property with respect to
  which such order was issued.
    (4) After service of such order upon a responsible person, such person
  may request a hearing, except in  circumstances  of  imminent  peril  in
  which  the  commissioner has determined that response measures are to be
  implemented without any delay. The commissioner shall  promulgate  rules
  and  regulations setting forth the times within which and the procedures
  by which requests for hearings shall be made and hearings shall be held.
  At such hearing  the  responsible  persons,  shall  be  entitled  to  be
  represented  by  counsel  and  to present evidence. The commissioner may
  affirm, modify or revoke the order.
    b.  In  addition  to  any  response  measures   implemented   by   the
  commissioner pursuant to section 24-608, if the responsible person fails
  to  comply  with  the  commissioner's  order  within  the time fixed for
  compliance pursuant to subdivision a of this section, the department may
  perform the work specified in the order, or may apply to  any  court  of
  competent jurisdiction, upon such notice and in such manner as the court
  shall  direct,  for  an order directing the responsible person to comply
  with the commissioner's order.
    c. Any responsible person  who  without  sufficient  cause,  willfully
  violates,  or  fails  or  refuses  to  comply  with,  any  order  of the
  commissioner issued pursuant to section 24-608 may be liable: (1) for  a
  civil  penalty  of  not  more  than ten thousand dollars for each day in
  which such violation  occurs  or  such  failure  or  refusal  to  comply
  continues; and (2) for an additional civil penalty in an amount at least
  equal  to,  and  not  more  than  three  times,  the amount of any costs
  incurred by the city as a result of such person's willful violation,  or
  failure or refusal to comply. Such penalties may be recovered in a civil

  action brought in the name of the commissioner or in a proceeding before
  the environmental control board.
    d.  In  addition  to  the penalties set forth in subdivision c of this
  section and subdivision b of section 24-609, any  person  who  knowingly
  violates or fails to comply with any order, rule or regulation issued by
  the  commissioner  pursuant  to  this  chapter  shall  be  guilty  of  a
  misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punishable by a  fine
  of not less than twenty-five thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not to
  exceed one year, or both, for each violation.
