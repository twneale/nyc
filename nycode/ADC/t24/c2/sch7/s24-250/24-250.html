  (a)  The  commissioner  shall act within a reasonable time not to exceed

  notify the applicant in writing of his or her approval or disapproval of

    (b) If an application is disapproved, the commissioner shall set forth
  his or her  objections  in  the  notice  of  disapproval  or  notice  of
  violation.
    (c)  Within sixty days after service on the applicant of the notice of
  disapproval, exclusive of the day of service, the applicant may  request
  the  commissioner  to reconsider the application by answering in writing
  the commissioner's objection to the application.
