  granted  or  renewed,  the  commissioner  may  require  the applicant to
  conduct such tests as are necessary in the opinion of  the  commissioner
  to  determine the sound level emitted from a device or an activity or to
  determine whether  the  device  or  its  operation  or  an  activity  is
  contributing to, or is in violation of this code. The test shall be made
  at the expense of the applicant.
    (b)  Such  test shall be conducted, reviewed and certified as provided
