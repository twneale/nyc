    &sect;  24-208  Registrations. (a) The commissioner may require the written
  registration of air  compressors,  paving  breakers,  refuse  compacting
  vehicles  and  rapid transit railroads, including but not limited to its
  rolling stock, track  and  trackbeds,  passenger  stations,  circulation
  devices  rated  300,000  BTUs  or  higher, tunnels, elevated structures,
  yards, depots and garages. A period of sixty days shall be  allowed  for
  the filing of such registration measured from the date such registration
  is  required  by  the  commissioner or with respect to devices installed
  after  such  requirement  is  instituted  measured  from  the  date   of
  installation.  However,  in  cases  of  emergency,  the commissioner may
  designate a shorter period of time.
    (b) Registration shall be made on forms furnished by  the  department.
  The  forms  may require information concerning the device covered by the
  registration, the sound level caused by the  device  or  any  additional
  information  required  by  the commissioner for the purpose of enforcing
  this code. The registrant shall maintain  the  registration  in  current
  status  by  notifying  the  department  of  any  change  in  any item of
  information furnished in  compliance  with  this  subdivision  within  a
  reasonable time not exceeding thirty days after the change is made.
    (c)  Registration  shall  be  made  by  the  owner of the device. If a
  registrant is a partnership or  group  other  than  a  corporation,  the
  registration  shall  be  made  by  one individual who is a member of the
  group. If the registrant is a corporation,  the  registration  shall  be
  made by an officer of the corporation.
