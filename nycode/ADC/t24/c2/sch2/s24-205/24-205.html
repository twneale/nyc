    &sect;  24-205  Investigations  and  studies  by  the commissioner. (a) The
  commissioner may make or cause to be made  any  investigation  or  study
  which  in  his  or her opinion is desirable for the purpose of enforcing
  this code or controlling or abating an unreasonable or prohibited noise.
  For such purposes, the commissioner may make  tests,  conduct  hearings,
  compel  the attendance of witnesses, and take their testimony under oath
  and may  compel  the  production  of  books,  papers  and  other  things
  reasonably necessary to the matter under consideration.
    (b)  The  commissioner  shall  study and propose strategies to control
  and/or reduce sound levels associated with airports, rapid  transit  and
  railroad  operations and within twenty-four months of the effective date
  of this section shall report to  the  mayor  his  or  her  findings  and
  recommendations, specifically identifying those recommendations that may
  only be implemented through state or federal legislation or rules.
    (c) The commissioner, in conjunction with the police department, shall
  study  noise  abatement  strategies  for  audible  motor vehicle burglar
  alarms and within twenty-four months  of  the  effective  date  of  this
  section   shall   report   to   the   mayor  his  or  her  findings  and
  recommendations.
    (d) The commissioner, in conjunction with the police department, shall
  study on an ongoing basis emerging technology in acoustical  measurement
  and  shall  periodically  report  to  the  mayor his or her findings and
  recommendations regarding the testing and potential use of equipment for
  enforcement  of  this  code.  In  conjunction  with  such   study,   the
  commissioner  may  issue  a  request  for  expressions  of  interest  to
  determine new and emerging  technological  solutions  for  accurate  and
  efficient measurement of sounds as enumerated in this code.
    (e)  The  commissioner shall study the impact of motor vehicle back-up
  warning devices installed on motor vehicles on ambient sound levels  and
  within  twenty-four  months  of the effective date of this section shall
  report  to  the  mayor  his  or  her   findings   and   recommendations,
  specifically   identifying   those  recommendations  that  may  only  be
  implemented through state or federal legislation.
