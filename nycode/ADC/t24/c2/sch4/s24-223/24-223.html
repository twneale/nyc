Section 24-223

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  24-223  After hours work authorization. (a) Notwithstanding section
  24-222 of this subchapter, an agency authorized  to  issue  permits  for
  construction work may, along with such permit, issue an after hours work
  authorization  for  the  work  site.  Such after hours authorization may
  permit construction work to be performed at the site before  7  a.m.  or
  after  6  p.m. on weekdays and/or on Saturdays and/or Sundays subject to
  the conditions and restrictions set forth in this section.
    (b) The agency issuing such authorization must obtain a  certification
  from  its  permittee that the permittee has developed a noise mitigation
  plan for the site in accordance with this subchapter and that such  plan
  is  in  compliance  with  the  noise  mitigation  rules.  In the case of
  emergency work such certification shall be submitted within 3 days after
  the commencement of the work.
    (c) If after hours  work  at  the  site  is  not  being  performed  in
  compliance  with such plan or where no plan is in effect, the department
  or the  agency  issuing  such  authorization,  at  the  request  of  the
  commissioner  or  on  its  own  account,  may  take  appropriate action,
  including but not limited to the  refusal  to  renew  such  after  hours
  authorization.
    (d)  Where there is full compliance with the noise mitigation plan yet
  nevertheless aggregate sound levels from the site where an  after  hours
  authorization  is  in effect exceed 8dB(A) above the ambient sound level
  as measured in any residential receiving property  dwelling  unit  (with
  windows   and  doors  that  may  affect  the  measurement  closed),  the
  commissioner may request the person performing the work to  confer  with
  representatives  of the department regarding additional noise mitigation
  measures that may be employed at the  site  to  reduce  aggregate  sound
  levels.  After  such conference the commissioner may direct amendment of
  the noise mitigation plan for the site. Failure to respond to a  request
  for  a  conference or to amend the noise mitigation plan within the time
  prescribed in a notice issued by the department shall be a violation  of
  this code.
    (e) Authorization for after hours construction work may only be issued
  in the following circumstances:
    (1)   Emergency  work.  Agencies  shall  authorize  such  after  hours
  construction work  for  emergency  conditions,  inside  or  outside  the
  property  line, involving a threat to public safety or causing or likely
  to cause the imminent interruption of service required by law,  contract
  or  franchise.  An  emergency  authorization  issued  pursuant  to  this
  paragraph shall expire as determined by the agency but no later than the
  ninetieth day after its issuance and shall be  renewable  in  accordance
  with agency procedures while the emergency continues.
    (2)  Public  safety.  Agencies  may  authorize  such after hours work,
  inside or outside of the property line, where the agency determines that
  the work cannot reasonably  or  practicably  be  performed  on  weekdays
  between  the  hours  of  7 a.m. and 6 p.m. because of traffic congestion
  and/or concern for worker and/or public safety. An authorization  issued
  pursuant  to this paragraph shall expire as determined by the agency but
  no later than  the  ninetieth  day  after  its  issuance  and  shall  be
  renewable in accordance with agency procedures.
    (3)  City  construction  projects.  Agencies may authorize after hours
  work by or on behalf of city agencies for projects that  are  judicially
  mandated  or  the  subject  of  consent orders and/or where a project is
  necessary  in  the  public  interest  including  but  not   limited   to
  facilities,  equipment,  and  infrastructure for the provision of water,
  sewerage, sanitation, transportation and other  services  necessary  for
  the  health or safety of the public. An authorization issued pursuant to

  this paragraph for a city construction project shall  remain  in  effect
  for the duration of the project.
    (4)   Construction   activities   with   minimal   noise  impact.  The
  commissioner shall promulgate rules setting forth a list of construction
  activities with minimal  noise  impact  and  specific  noise  mitigation
  measures  applicable  to  such  activities.  Agencies  may authorize the
  performance of such construction activities after  hours  in  accordance
  with such rules.
    (5)  Undue  hardship.  Agencies  may authorize after hours work if the
  commissioner certifies that the permit holder has substantiated a  claim
  of undue hardship resulting from unique site characteristics, unforeseen
  conditions,   scheduling  commitments  and/or  financial  considerations
  outside the control of the permit holder  and  that  the  applicant  has
  received approval from the department of an alternative noise mitigation
  plan  pursuant  to  section  24-221  of  this subchapter, specifying the
  activities  and  devices  that  will  be  used  for  such  after   hours
  construction and setting forth the additional mitigation measures, above
  and  beyond  those  measures  otherwise  required  for  such devices and
  activities pursuant to the department's rules, that the  applicant  will
  use  to  significantly limit noise emissions from the site of such after
  hours work. Applications for such certification shall  be  submitted  to
  the  department in a form and manner to be set forth in the rules of the
  department. The applicant for an after hours  authorization  under  this
  paragraph shall submit such certification to the issuing agency.
