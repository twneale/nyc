Section 24-221

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  24-221 Alternative noise mitigation plan. (a) Upon application, the
  commissioner may approve an alternative  noise  mitigation  plan  for  a
  particular  construction  site that deviates from strict compliance with
  the noise mitigation rules. Application for approval of such plan  shall
  be  submitted  to the department at least ten business days prior to the
  commencement of construction or as soon as practicable but no later than
  24 hours prior to the commencement of construction in a form and  manner
  and  accompanied  by  such information and documentation as shall be set
  forth in the rules of the department. The commissioner may approve  such
  alternative noise mitigation plan if he or she finds that:
    (1)  strict  compliance  with  the noise mitigation rules would not be
  possible or would create an undue hardship because of  the  location  or
  unique  characteristics  of  the  site or of the construction devices or
  activities to be employed or performed at the site; and
    (2) the alternative noise mitigation strategies,  methods,  procedures
  or  equipment  proposed are consistent with the purposes and policies of
  this code.
    (b)  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing  provisions,  with   respect   to
  construction  sites where construction is performed pursuant to a permit
  issued prior to the effective date of this section or  in  the  case  of
  construction  by  or  on  behalf  of a city agency where construction is
  performed under a contract bid out prior to the effective date  of  this
  section,  application  for  approval  of an alternative noise mitigation
  plan may be submitted within 60 days after the effective  date  of  this
  section. The commissioner may approve such plan if he or she finds that:
    (1)  strict  compliance  with  the noise mitigation rules would not be
  possible or would create an undue hardship because of  the  location  or
  unique  characteristics  of  the  site or of the construction devices or
  activities employed or performed at the site, or
    (2) strict compliance with such rules would be unreasonable or  unduly
  burdensome with respect to construction work that is imminent or ongoing
  on the effective date of this section, or
    (3)  with respect to city construction projects, the implementation of
  contract modifications to achieve  strict  compliance  with  such  rules
  would  result  in  unreasonable delay and/or increased expenditure for a
  necessary public improvement, and
    (4) the alternative noise mitigation strategies,  methods,  procedures
  or  equipment  proposed are consistent with the purposes and policies of
  this code.
    (c) Where the commissioner rejects  an  alternative  noise  mitigation
  plan,  an  applicant  may  appeal  such rejection in accordance with the
  rules of the department. An alternative plan  shall  not  be  in  effect
  unless  and  until  it has been approved by the commissioner except that
  where a timely alternative plan has been filed with the commissioner for
  approval, a construction site in compliance with such  alternative  plan
  shall  be  deemed to be in compliance with this section unless and until
  such plan is rejected by the commissioner  and  for  a  reasonable  time
  thereafter as determined by the commissioner.
