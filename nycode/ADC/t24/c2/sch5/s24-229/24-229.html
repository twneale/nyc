<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  24-229  Containers  and  construction material. (a) No person shall
  handle or transport or cause to be handled or transported on any  public
  right-of-way any container or any construction material in such a way as
  to  create  an  unreasonable  noise.  For  the  purposes of this section
  unreasonable noise shall  include  but  shall  not  be  limited  to  the
  following prohibited noise levels:
    (1)  Sound,  other  than  impulsive  sound, attributable to the source
  measured at a level of 10 dB(A) or more above the ambient  sound  level,
  as measured at any point within a receiving property or as measured at a
  distance of 15 feet or more from the source on a public right-of-way.
    (2)  Impulsive  sound, attributable to the source, measured at a level
  of 15 dB(A) or more above the ambient sound level, as  measured  at  any
  point  within  a  receiving  property or as measured at a distance of 15
  feet or more from the source on a public right-of-way.  Impulsive  sound
  levels shall be measured in the A-weighting network with the sound level
  meter  set  to  fast response. The ambient sound level shall be taken in
  the A-weighting network with the sound level meter set to slow response.
    (b) This section shall not apply to the operation of refuse collection
  vehicles regulated pursuant to section 24-225.
