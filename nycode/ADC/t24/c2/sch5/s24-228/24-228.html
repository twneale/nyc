Section 24-228

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 24-228 Construction, exhausts and other devices. (a) No person shall
  operate  or use or cause to be operated or used a construction device or
  combination of devices in such a way as to create an unreasonable noise.
  For the purposes of this section unreasonable noise  shall  include  but
  shall  not  be  limited  to  sound that exceeds the following prohibited
  noise levels:
    (1) Sound, other than impulsive sound, attributable to the  source  or
  sources,  that  exceeds  85  dB(A)  as measured 50 or more feet from the
  source or sources at a point outside the property line where the  source
  or sources are located or as measured 50 or more feet from the source or
  sources on a public right-of-way.
    (2)  Impulsive  sound, attributable to the source, that is 15 dB(A) or
  more above the ambient sound level as measured at  any  point  within  a
  receiving  property or as measured at a distance of 15 feet or more from
  the source on a public right-of-way. Impulsive  sound  levels  shall  be
  measured  in  the  A-weighting network with the sound level meter set to
  fast response. The ambient sound level shall be taken in the A-weighting
  network with the sound level meter set to slow response.
    (b) Where a particular sound source or device is  subject  to  decibel
  level limits and requirements specifically prescribed for such source or
  device  elsewhere in this code, such specific decibel limits shall apply
  to such device or source. However, if  aggregate  sound  levels  from  a
  construction   site  exceed  the  limits  set  forth  in  this  section,
  compliance with such specific decibel limits shall not be a  defense  in
  any proceeding relating to a violation of this section.
