Section 24-218

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  24-218  General prohibitions. (a) No person shall make, continue or
  cause or permit to be made or continued any unreasonable noise.
    (b) Unreasonable noise shall include  but  shall  not  be  limited  to
  sound, attributable to any device, that exceeds the following prohibited
  noise levels:
    (1)  Sound,  other  than  impulsive sound, attributable to the source,
  measured at a level of 7 dB(A) or more above the ambient sound level  at
  or  after  10:00  p.m.  and  before  7:00 a.m., as measured at any point
  within a receiving property or as measured at a distance of 15  feet  or
  more from the source on a public right-of-way.
    (2)  Sound,  other  than  impulsive sound, attributable to the source,
  measured at a level of 10 dB(A) or more above the ambient sound level at
  or after 7:00 a.m. and before 10:00  p.m.,  as  measured  at  any  point
  within  a  receiving property or as measured at a distance of 15 feet or
  more from the source on a public right-of-way.
    (3) Impulsive sound, attributable to the source, measured at  a  level
  of  15  dB(A)  or more above the ambient sound level, as measured at any
  point within a receiving property or as measured at  a  distance  of  15
  feet  or  more from the source on a public right-of-way. Impulsive sound
  levels shall be measured in the A-weighting network with the sound level
  meter set to fast response. The ambient sound level shall  be  taken  in
  the A-weighting network with the sound level meter set to slow response.
    (c)  Notwithstanding  the provisions of subdivision b of this section,
  where a particular sound source or device is subject  to  decibel  level
  limits  and  requirements  specifically  prescribed  for  such source or
  device elsewhere in this code, the decibel level  limits  set  forth  in
  this section shall not apply to such sound source or device.
    (d) The decibel level limits set forth in this section shall not apply
  to sound attributable to construction devices and activities.
    (e) Where the commissioner finds that sound from any refuse collection
  facility  regulated  by the department of sanitation exceeds the decibel
  level limits set forth in this section, the commissioner shall order the
  operator of such facility to submit a certification  by  a  professional
  engineer  as  to  whether  or not the facility is in compliance with the
  noise standards required by the department of sanitation rules (16  RCNY
  Ch.  4)  and  if not in compliance, the mitigation measures that will be
  undertaken to bring such  facility  into  compliance.  The  testing  and
  certification  must be submitted to the department and to the department
  of sanitation within forty-five days after the issuance of such order. A
  facility that complies with an order issued pursuant to this section and
  with  any  required  mitigation  measures  shall  be  deemed  to  be  in
  compliance  with the decibel limits of this section. With respect to any
  refuse collection facility  owned  or  operated  by  the  department  of
  sanitation  such  facility  shall be deemed to be in compliance with the
  decibel level limits of this section if it is in compliance with a  best
  management  practices plan developed in conjunction with the department.
  A notice of violation  may  only  be  issued  for  a  refuse  collection
  facility  pursuant  to  this section where the operator of such facility
  fails to comply with an order of the  commissioner  issued  pursuant  to
  this   subdivision   or   the   mitigation   measures  set  forth  in  a
  certification.
