    &sect;  24-237  Sound signal devices. (a) No person shall operate or use or
  cause to be operated or used any claxon installed on  a  motor  vehicle,
  except as a sound signal of imminent danger or in connection with use as
  an  audible motor vehicle burglar alarm as provided in section 24-238 of
  this code.
    (b) No person shall operate or use or cause to be operated or used  an
  air  horn  or gong installed on any motor vehicle other than as provided
  in section 24-241 of this code.
    (c) No person shall operate or use or cause to be operated or used any

  of  the  time  to  start  and stop work or as a sound signal of imminent
  danger.
    (d) No person shall operate or use or cause to be operated or used  on
  any  public  right-of-way  any electrically operated or electronic sound
  signal device (other than a safety device, such as but not limited to  a
  car  horn  or  back  up  signal,  that is actually used for its intended
  purpose) attached to, on or  in  a  motor  vehicle,  wagon  or  manually
  propelled  cart  from  which food or any other items are sold or offered
  for sale when the vehicle  is  stopped,  standing  or  parked.  For  the
  purposes  of  this subdivision the term "stopped" means the halting of a
  vehicle, whether  occupied  or  not,  except  when  necessary  to  avoid
  conflict  with  other  traffic or in compliance with a police officer or
  other authorized enforcement  officer  or  a  traffic  control  sign  or
  signal.  The  terms  "standing"  and "parked" shall be as defined in the
  vehicle and traffic law.
