    &sect; 24-712 Inspections of a facility. (a) The department, upon providing
  prior  notice,  shall  have the authority to inspect any facility during
  normal business hours. However, whenever there is a  reason  to  believe
  that a facility is in violation of the requirements of this chapter, the
  department  shall  be  authorized  to inspect the facility without prior
  notice. Any reasonable party who refuses to allow an authorized employee
  or representative of the department to  conduct  an  inspection  of  the
  facility  after  appropriate  credentials  are  presented  shall  be  in
  violation of this chapter and shall be subject to the penalties provided
  in subdivision c of section 24-713 of this chapter.
    (b) Within twenty business days of receipt of a written  complaint  in
  such form as may be prescribed by the commissioner, alleging a violation
  of  any  of  the  provisions  of  this  chapter,  the  department  shall
  investigate such complaint and  shall  inform  the  complainant  of  the
  results of such investigation.
