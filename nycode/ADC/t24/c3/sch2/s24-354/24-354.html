Section 24-354

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  24-354  Work  and materials to be procured by contract; exceptions;
  certificate of public interest. a. All work hereby authorized to be done
  and all  materials  hereby  authorized  to  be  furnished  involving  an
  expenditure  of over one thousand dollars, shall be procured by contract
  made in the manner required by and pursuant to the  provisions  of  this
  subchapter.  The  commissioner of environmental protection, however, may
  without contract cause such surveys to be made and such maps, plans  and
  estimates  to be prepared, as shall, in his or her opinion, be necessary
  to carry out the provisions of this subchapter, and may appoint and  fix
  the  compensation  of  suitable engineers and other persons to supervise
  and inspect all work hereby authorized to be done. The  commissioner  of
  environmental  protection  may  procure  any  work  to  be  done without
  contract, not involving an expenditure of over five thousand dollars, if
  the commissioner certifies that in his or her opinion,  it  is  for  the
  public  interest  that  such  work  be done; and in such certificate the
  commissioner shall state his or her reasons therefor.
    b. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provisions of this  subchapter  or
  of  any  general  or  special  law,  the  commissioner  of environmental
  protection, during the existence of a state of war  between  the  United
  States  of  America  and the governments of Germany, Japan and Italy, or
  any of them, and for six months immediately  following  the  termination
  thereof,  may  procure  or  contract  for,  without  public letting, any
  equipment or materials necessary for  the  completion  of  the  Delaware
  aqueduct  and  appurtenant  structures  and  for  any work to be done in
  connection with the installation of such equipment or materials  if  the
  commissioner  certifies  that in his or her opinion, it is in the public
  interest that any such equipment or material be procured  or  contracted
  for  or  any  such  work  be  done, without public letting, and any such
  certificate of the commissioner shall state his or her reasons therefor.
  Any such certificate shall be filed in the office of the comptroller  of
  the city of New York.
