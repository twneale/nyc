Section 24-350

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;    24-350   Public   opening   of   bids,   acceptance;   rejection;
  readvertisement.   After the expiration  of  the  time  limited  in  the
  advertisement,  such  bids  or proposals shall be publicly opened by the
  commissioner and  he  or  she  may  select  the  bid  or  proposal,  the
  acceptance  of  which  will, in the commissioner's judgment, best secure
  the efficient performance of the work, or the  commissioner  may  reject
  any  or  all  of  such  bids.  In case of the rejection of all bids, the
  commissioner shall readvertise such  contract,  and  shall  receive  and
  dispose  of  the  bids  tendered  under such advertisement in the manner
  hereinbefore provided. In case  any  work  shall  be  abandoned  by  any
  contractor,  or  the  contractor's  contract  terminated pursuant to the
  provisions thereof, it shall be readvertised and  relet  in  the  manner
  provided  for  in this subchapter for the original letting of such work,
  except that in such a case, the board of estimate by a  two-thirds  vote
  may  order  otherwise, and may authorize, upon the recommendation of the
  commissioner, the completion of the work in  such  manner  and  by  such
  means as the commissioner deems appropriate.
