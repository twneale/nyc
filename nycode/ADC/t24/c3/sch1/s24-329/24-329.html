Section 24-329

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 24-329 Interments near reservoir prohibited. It shall be unlawful to
  establish  any  cemetery  or place of burial, or burial vaults, or other
  place for the reception or burial of dead bodies, or to bury, or deposit
  in vaults, any dead body, within a  distance  of  half  a  mile  of  any
  reservoir,  or  any ponds used for the supply of the borough of Brooklyn
  with water. In the county of Nassau, however, it shall be lawful  to  do
  so  with  the  written consent of the state department of health and the
  commissioner of environmental protection upon such terms and  conditions
  as  may  be  prescribed  by  such  commissioner. This section shall not,
  however, be  construed  to  prevent  burials  in  any  cemetery  already
  established, or grounds now held by any religious corporation or society
  organized under the laws of this state.
