Section 24-343

    &sect;  24-343 Transfer of house service pipe connection to new water main.
  a.  In instances where the city has laid a water main in a street  where
  surface  grades have been established but where the surface has not been
  improved to the established grade and when a new water main is installed
  by the city because it is required by the grading of such street to  the
  established  grade,  the  commissioner of environmental protection shall
  issue an order directing the owner of  each  house  which  was  directly
  connected  with  the  main  as  previously  laid,  to transfer the house
  service pipe connection to the new main, at the expense  of  such  owner
  when  required  in  accordance  with  the  rules  and regulations of the
  commissioner.
    b. When a new water main is installed by the city to replace a private
  main, the commissioner shall issue an order directing the owner of  each
  house  fronting  on  the city main and receiving water from such private
  main to transfer the house service pipe connection to the city main,  at
  the  expense  of  such  owner  and  in  accordance  with  the  rules and
  regulations of the commissioner.
    c. An order issued pursuant to this section shall be served  upon  the
  owner of the premises, by registered mail sent to the address registered
  by  such  owner  in  the bureau of city collections in the department of
  finance, or if no address is registered in such  bureau,  by  registered
  mail  sent to the last known address of such owner, or to the address of
  such owner as shown on the records in the office  where  conveyances  of
  real property are recorded pursuant to law.
    d.  If  the  transfer is not made within ten days after the mailing of
  such order, the department of environmental  protection  may  make  such
  transfer through its officers, agents or contractors. The owner shall be
  personally  liable  for  the  expenses and disbursements incurred by the
  department in making such transfer. The  amount  of  such  expenses  and
  disbursements  shall  be  due  and  payable when definitely fixed by the
  commissioner of environmental protection and entered upon the records in
  the office of the city collector. A notice stating the  amount  due  and
  the  nature  of  the charge shall be mailed by the city collector within
  five days after such entry to the address registered by  such  owner  in
  the  bureau  of  city collections in the department of finance, or if no
  address is registered in such bureau, to the last known address  of  the
  owner  of  such property or to the address of such owner as shown on the
  records in the office where conveyances of real  property  are  recorded
  pursuant to law. If such amount is not paid on or before the last day of
  the month following the month of entry, it shall be the duty of the city
  collector to charge, collect and receive interest thereon at the rate of
  seven  per  cent  per annum to be calculated to the date of payment from
  the date of entry. The amount of such expenses and disbursements and the
  interest thereon shall be  a  lien  upon  the  premises  for  which  the
  transfer  of  the  house  service pipe connection was made, and shall be
  enforced and collected in the manner provided in chapter three of  title
  eleven  of  this  code for the enforcement and collection of water rents
  and the lien thereof.
