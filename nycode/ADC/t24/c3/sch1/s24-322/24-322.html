Section 24-322

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  24-322 Special water service for fire, sanitary and other purposes.
  a.   The board of  estimate  may  make  and  enter  into  contracts  and
  agreements for a term of years with any corporation duly organized under
  the  laws  of  this state, for the furnishing of a special water service
  for fire, sanitary and other purposes, and for supplying water  suitable
  therefor  from  any  source  with  a  pressure  equal to a head of three
  hundred feet above tide  water.  Such  contracts  and  agreements  shall
  contain  such  conditions, provisions and stipulations as such board may
  consider necessary and proper in the interests of the city, and shall be
  upon such terms as it deems best. Such  board,  by  such  contract,  may
  authorize  such  corporation to lay down pipes and erect hydrants in the
  streets of the city, under such restrictions and conditions  as  may  be
  prescribed by such board.
    b.  Such  contracts or agreements may also provide for the purchase by
  the city of all the rights and property secured by such corporation  and
  the  works  constructed  by  them  for furnishing water for such special
  purposes, when such board of estimate shall deem such purchase to be for
  the interest of the city. Such purchase,  however,  must  be  determined
  upon  by such board at the expiration of five years from the date of the
  contract. The cost of such purchase shall be determined  by  arbitrators
  appointed by the supreme court.
    c.  This  section  and  all contracts or agreements executed under its
  provisions, shall be construed so as not to interfere  with,  hinder  or
  delay  the construction and use of any works now or hereafter authorized
  by law, relating to procuring an increased  supply  of  water  from  the
  Croton aqueduct system of the city.
