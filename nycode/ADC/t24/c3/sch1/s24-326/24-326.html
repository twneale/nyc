Section 24-326

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 24-326 Regulation of use of lakes and reservoirs used for city water
  supply.  a.  Any natural lake or any reservoir used or built by the city
  for water supply purposes may be used by the public for boating, cutting
  ice and fishing. The city and its  representatives  shall  not  prohibit
  such  use,  and  they  are  required  to  afford access to such lakes or
  reservoirs, except that the city may prohibit such use in the event of a
  declaration of an emergency by the governor as hereinafter provided  and
  except  in  the event of the declaration of war by or against the United
  States of America. The city may grant permits to boat owners for the use
  of boats on such lakes and  reservoirs,  and  may  prescribe  rules  and
  regulations for their proper use.
    b.  If any emergency shall have been declared to exist by the governor
  in the manner hereinafter provided in subdivision c of this  section  or
  in  the event of a declaration of war by or against the United States of
  America, the mayor, for the duration of such emergency or of  such  war,
  may revoke, in whole or in part, the privileges set forth in subdivision
  a  hereof and prohibit the use by the public of the lakes and reservoirs
  of the city. The commissioner may make reasonable rules and  regulations
  as  to  the  use of such reservoirs during such emergency or war period.
  Any such order of revocation  shall  define  the  terms  and  extent  of
  revocation, and shall state the date on which it shall become effective.
  Any   rules   and   regulations   promulgated  by  the  commissioner  of
  environmental protection during such emergency shall be  published  once
  in  a  newspaper  circulating in each of the counties in which the water
  supply property to be affected thereby shall be located.
    c. The governor is hereby empowered to declare  the  existence  of  an
  emergency  affecting the city's water supply sources upon application of
  the  commissioner  of  environmental  protection  and  subject  to   the
  following conditions:
    1.  Notice  of  the  application  by  the  commissioner  to  have such
  emergency declared and of the date and place of the public hearing to be
  had thereon shall be published at least twice in a  newspaper  published
  in  each  county  in which are located the sources of water supply as to
  which it is claimed the emergency exists and in addition written  notice
  of  such  application  and  of the date and place of the hearing thereon
  shall be served on the clerk of the board of supervisors  of  each  such
  county at least eight days before such hearing.
    2.  After  such  public hearing, at which all persons interested shall
  have an opportunity to be heard, the governor, may, if he or  she  deems
  such  emergency  to  exist,  declare  the  existence  of  such emergency
  affecting the city's water supply sources and fix the period  for  which
  the  emergency  shall be deemed to exist. The duration of such period of
  emergency may be extended after the giving of similar notice  and  after
  holding of a similar public hearing.
    3.  Notwithstanding  the  requirements  of  paragraphs  one and two of
  subdivision c of this section, the governor  shall  have  the  power  to
  declare  the existence of an emergency affecting the city's water supply
  sources or any part thereof upon application of the commissioner without
  notice, and without a public hearing for a period not  exceeding  thirty
  days.  Where  such  emergency  is  so declared, however, it shall not be
  extended or renewed except after notice and public hearing  as  provided
  in such paragraphs one and two.
    d.  In the event of the declaration of an emergency by the governor or
  of the declaration of war by or against the United  States  of  America,
  duly  designated employees of the department of environmental protection
  are empowered and authorized to act as peace officers in any  county  in
  which  any  water supply property of the city is located for the purpose
  of enforcing the rules and regulations promulgated by  the  commissioner

  for  the  period  of  the  emergency.  The  department  of environmental
  protection shall file in the office of the sheriff of each such county a
  certificate of appointment of each such designated employee,  and  shall
  attach  to  each  such  certificate  a  complete  copy  of the rules and
  regulations promulgated  pursuant  to  subdivisions  a  and  b  of  this
  section. Copies of all amendments of such rules and regulations shall be
  filed  by  the  commissioner  with each such sheriff. The sheriff of any
  such county may cancel any such certificate  for  cause,  and  forthwith
  shall  mail  written  notice  of  such cancellation to the department of
  environmental protection,  specifying  the  cause  of  such  revocation.
  Immediately  upon  any such cancellation, the employee whose certificate
  shall have been cancelled, shall have no further authority to act  as  a
  peace  officer.  Each  employee  so appointed at all times when on duty,
  shall have in his or her possession a shield or other suitable badge  of
  authority  which  he  or  she  shall  exhibit at once to any person upon
  request.
    e. It shall be the special duty  of  the  employees  so  appointed  to
  prevent  breaches  of  the peace and unlawful depredations and to arrest
  and bring before the  proper  judicial  officer  any  person  guilty  of
  violating any of such rules and regulations.
    f.  Any person convicted of violating any of the rules and regulations
  promulgated pursuant to subdivision a of this section shall be  punished
  by  a  fine  of  not more than ten dollars for the first offense, twenty
  dollars or ten days imprisonment, or both, for the  second  offense,  or
  fifty  dollars or fifty days imprisonment, or both, for the third or any
  subsequent offense.
