Section 24-334

<pre>
    
 
    &sect; 24-334 Water meters; when to be placed. * a. (1) The commissioner is
  authorized to install or cause to be installed water meters, the pattern
  and maximum price of which shall be approved by the board of estimate in
  any  or all stores, workshops, hotels, lodging houses, factories, office
  buildings, and public edifices, at wharves, ferry houses,  and  stables,
  and  in  all places in which water is furnished for business consumption
  and in any or all new or substantially improved  or  altered  dwellings.
  When  authorized  thereto  by  resolution of the board of estimate or by
  local law, the commissioner may install such meters in any or all  other
  multiple  dwellings, and he or she shall install such meter or meters or
  cause them to be installed upon written demand of the owner of  any  lot
  or premises to which such water is supplied.
    (2) For purposes of this subdivision an improvement or alteration is a
  physical  change in an existing structure, other than painting, ordinary
  repairs and normal replacement of maintenance items. A  structure  shall
  be deemed to have been substantially improved or altered where:
    (a)  the  cost  of  improvement  or  alteration exceeds the sum of one
  hundred fifty thousand dollars; or
    (b) fifty percent or more of the dwelling units or square feet of  the
  structure  in multiple dwellings are improved or altered and the cost of
  such improvement or alteration  exceeds  the  sum  of  fifteen  thousand
  dollars per dwelling unit; or
    (c) there has been a conversion in the use of the structure.
 
    * NB Amended L.L. 53/85 &sect; 1, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 &sect; 14
 
    b.  Thereafter,  as  shall  be  determined  by  the  commissioner, the
  department shall make out  all  charges  for  water  furnished  by  such
  department   to  such  premises  in  ratable  proportion  to  the  water
  furnished, as ascertained by meter, subject to such minimum and  service
  charges as may be established. All expense and cost of meters, and their
  connections,  and  of their setting, repair and maintenance, unless with
  the approval of the board of estimate such expense and cost be borne  by
  the department, shall be a charge and lien upon the premises.
    c.  This  section  shall  not, however, be construed so as to remit or
  prevent  the  due  collection  of  arrearages  or  charges   for   water
  consumption  heretofore  incurred,  nor  interfere with the proper liens
  therefor, nor of charges, or rates, or liens hereafter  to  be  incurred
  for water consumption in any building or place which may not contain one
  of  the  meters  aforesaid. The moneys collected for service charges and
  for expense and cost of meters and their connections, and  for  setting,
  repairing,  maintaining  and  replacing  the same, may be applied by the
  commissioner to the payment of expenses incurred in procuring meters and
  their  connections  and  in  their  setting,  repair,  maintenance   and
  replacement.
