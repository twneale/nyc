Section 24-337

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  24-337 Waste of water prohibited; remedies. a. It shall be unlawful
  for water to be wasted, whether owing to  leak  or  wasteful  condition,
  regardless  of  fault,  from  any  water  pipe,  valve, faucet, conduit,
  equipment, facility or device connected to  the  city  water  system  or
  which  utilizes  city  water.  It shall be the duty of an owner, lessee,
  agent, manager, operator and of any other person in charge of or who has
  control  over  any  premises,  plant,  equipment,  facility,  device  or
  operation  to  make  frequent  regular inspections so as to minimize the
  likelihood of leak or waste and  within  a  reasonable  time  after  the
  discovery  or  notification  of any leak or wasteful condition to effect
  repairs or take other appropriate corrective action within the power  of
  such   person.   The  commissioner  of  environmental  protection  shall
  promulgate such reasonable rules and regulations as the commissioner may
  from time to time deem appropriate for the prevention of  the  waste  of
  water.
    b.   In  addition  to  enforcement  pursuant  to  section  24-346  the
  commissioner may serve a leak and waste notice upon any person having  a
  duty  to  repair  or  correct  a  leak or wasteful condition or upon any
  person in violation of the rules and regulations for the  prevention  of
  the  waste  of water. Such notice shall specify the repair or correction
  to be made and shall fix a reasonable time for  compliance.  Where  such
  notice  has  been served and water continues to be wasted after the time
  for correction has expired, the commissioner may, after  notice  and  an
  opportunity  for  a  hearing  before  the  commissioner  or  his  or her
  designee, turn off the water supply to the premises or impose a  penalty
  not to exceed fifty dollars per day for each day that water continues to
  be  wasted  after  the expiration date contained in the notice, or both.
  Any penalty imposed pursuant to this section may be added to  the  water
  rents;  except  that no such penalty may be imposed against any property
  unless both the leak and waste notice and notice of  the  proceeding  to
  impose  the  penalty was served upon the owner by mailing copies thereof
  to the person whose name appears on the records in  the  office  of  the
  city  collector  as being the owner or agent or as the person designated
  by the owner to receive tax bills  at  the  address  on  file  for  such
  purpose or where no name appears to the property addressed to "owner" or
  "agent" and such person has had an opportunity to be heard.
    The provisions of this subdivision shall not be construed to limit the
  commissioner's  power  to  shut off water supply without notice, or with
  such notice as the commissioner  may  deem  practicable,  where  a  leak
  exists; or where emergency action is otherwise deemed essential.
    (c)   The  department  shall  establish  or  reestablish  a  permanent
  committee on water conservation (the "committee") within six  months  of
  the  effective  date  of  this  section  consisting  of outside experts,
  representatives  of  public  interest,  environmental  and  professional
  groups  and  interested  citizens, two of whom shall be appointed by the
  city council and the rest shall be appointed by  the  commissioner.  The
  members  of the committee shall serve without compensation for a term of
  three years. The commissioner shall be the chairman.
    (d) Within one year after the effective  date  of  this  section,  and
  annually  thereafter,  the  committee shall submit to the city council a
  report evaluating the  effectiveness  of  paragraphs  a  through  e,  of
  subdivision  P.104.2  of  section  P.104.0  RS  16 describing the latest
  available   water-conserving    fixtures,    and    including    written
  recommendations.  The  department  shall make available to the committee
  any and all information  useful  and  necessary  for  the  committee  to
  prepare  and  complete the report for submission to the city council. To
  prepare such report the committee shall utilize any  information  and/or
  materials   determined   to  be  pertinent  that  have  been  published,

  distributed or in any other manner made available from  state  agencies,
  public  and  private  research  groups, multi-state agencies such as the
  Delaware River Basin Commission, and other  similar  public  or  private
  agencies  or  groups  with  expertise  with  respect to water-conserving
  plumbing fixtures. The report shall include, but not be limited to:
    (1) a review of compliance with paragraphs a through e, of subdivision
  P.104.2 of section P.104.0 of reference standard RS 16 of  the  appendix
  to  chapter  one  of title twenty-seven of this code, the impact of such
  compliance, and the relationship of the standards set  forth  herein  to
  current technology;
    (2)  recommendations as to the feasibility of requiring more stringent
  water-saving performance standards than provided in paragraphs a through
  e of subdivision P.104.2 of section P.104.0 of reference standard RS 16.
    (e) The department shall establish a  city-wide  comprehensive  public
  information campaign focusing on water-conserving fixtures, the benefits
  of  good  water-saving equipment, and the opportunity for rapid pay-back
  and long-term money savings, especially in energy costs, for home owners
  and landlords. Within six  months  after  the  effective  date  of  this
  section,  a  proposal  for  the  public  information  campaign  shall be
  submitted to the city council for review and commentary. The  department
  shall  report  annually  to the city council on the status of the public
  information campaign.
