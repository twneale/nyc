Section 24-343.1

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  24-343.1  Backflow  prevention device reporting. a. For purposes of
  this section the following terms shall have the following meanings:
    (1) "Backflow" shall mean a flow condition, induced by a  differential
  in pressure, that causes the flow of water or other liquids and/or gases
  into the distribution of pipes of a city water main, private water main,
  or  to  an  internal  water main from any source other than its intended
  source.
    (2)  "Backsiphonage"  shall  mean  the  backflow  of  contaminated  or
  polluted water, or water of questionable quality from a plumbing fixture
  or  other  source,  into a city water main, private water main, or to an
  internal water main due  to  a  temporary  negative  or  sub-atmospheric
  pressure within the public water supply system.
    (3)  "Backflow  prevention  device"  shall  mean  an approved air gap,
  reduced pressure zone device or double  check  valve  assembly  used  to
  contain potential contamination within a facility.
    (4) "Cross connection" shall mean a physical connection or arrangement
  between  two  separate  piping systems where one system contains potable
  water and the other  contains  steam,  gas,  a  chemical,  or  water  of
  questionable  safety,  and  there  may  be a flow from one system to the
  other.
    (5) "Hazardous facility" shall mean a facility in which substances may
  be present that  may  endanger  the  health  of  other  water  users  if
  introduced  into  the public water system, including but not limited to,
  laboratories, sewage treatment plants, chemical  plants,  hospitals  and
  mortuaries.
    b.  When  the  department  or  the  owner or operator of a building or
  structure has determined  that  there  is  a  cross  connection  and  no
  backflow  prevention  device,  or a defective or unapproved device, such
  that there is a possibility  of  backflow  or  backsiphonage  from  such
  building  or structure into a city water main, private water main, or to
  an internal water main, the  owner  or  operator  of  such  building  or
  structure  shall  be  under  a  duty to correct such potential or actual
  backflow or  backsiphonage  and  provide  the  proper  documentation  to
  certify  to  the  department  that a backflow prevention device has been
  installed and where appropriate, that a backflow prevention  device  has
  been  replaced.  Where  removal of a cross-connection or installation or
  replacement of a backflow prevention device has been performed  as  part
  of  a  project  for which a licensed professional engineer or registered
  architect has submitted plans that have been approved by the department,
  such  licensed  professional  engineer  or  registered  architect  shall
  inspect   and   submit  to  the  department  a  certification  that  the
  cross-connection has  been  removed  or  a  backflow  prevention  device
  installed   or  replaced  in  conformity  with  plans  approved  by  the
  department or the department of buildings.
    c. The department shall send out  a  mailing  to  or  shall  otherwise
  notify owners or operators of facilities identified by the department as
  potentially  requiring backflow prevention devices informing them of the
  potential need for such a device and of the process for installation  of
  backflow  prevention  devices under the auspices of the cross connection
  control program. The  materials  contained  in  such  mailing  shall  be
  translated  into  such  languages provided for in section 8-1002 of this
  code.
    d. On or before January 1, 2010, the department shall submit a  report
  to  the council setting forth the number of hazardous facilities and all
  other facilities which the department knows have had  required  backflow
  prevention  devices  installed  and  the  number  of  facilities in each
  category that have been notified  by  the  department  of  the  need  to
  install  one  or  more backflow prevention devices. Every July first and

  January first thereafter, the department shall submit a  report  to  the
  council  setting  forth  the  number  of facilities in each category for
  which one or more backflow prevention devices were installed  since  the
  last report was required, the number of facilities in each category that
  have  been  newly notified by the department of the need to install such
  devices, and the number of violations issued by the department  for  the
  failure to install a required backflow prevention device.
