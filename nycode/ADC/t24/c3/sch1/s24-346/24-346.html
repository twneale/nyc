Section 24-346

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  24-346  Enforcement  and  penalties.  a.  Notwithstanding any other
  provision of law, the commissioner of environmental protection  and  the
  environmental control board shall enforce the provisions of this chapter
  and  chapter four of this title and the regulations promulgated pursuant
  thereto or pursuant to section fourteen hundred three of  the  New  York
  city  charter as hereinafter provided. Such commissioner and board shall
  have the power to issue such orders as may be provided  for  herein  and
  such  additional  orders as may be necessary for the enforcement of such
  provisions.
    b. Any person who  violates  or  fails  to  comply  with  any  of  the
  provisions  of this chapter and chapter four of this title or any order,
  rule or regulation issued by the  board  or  commissioner  or  with  the
  conditions  of  any permit issued by the commissioner within the city of
  New York shall be liable for a civil penalty of not less than fifty  nor
  more than one thousand dollars for each violation, except that the civil
  penalty  for  the  removal  of  a  manhole cover in violation of section
  24-304 shall be not less than two thousand five hundred dollars nor more
  then ten thousand dollars. In the case of a  continuing  violation  each
  day's  continuance  shall  be  a  separate  and  distinct  offense.  The
  environmental control board shall have the power to  impose  such  civil
  penalties.  A  proceeding to impose such penalties shall be commenced by
  the service of a notice of violation  returnable  to  such  board.  Such
  board,  after  a hearing as provided by the rules and regulations of the
  board, shall have the power to enforce its final  decisions  and  orders
  imposing  such  civil penalties as if they were money judgments pursuant
  to subdivision d of section one thousand forty-nine-a of  the  New  York
  city charter. A civil penalty imposed by the board may also be collected
  in  an  action brought in the name of the city in any court of competent
  jurisdiction.  The board, in its discretion, may, within the limits  set
  forth  in  this  subdivision,  establish  a  schedule of civil penalties
  indicating the minimum and maximum penalty for each separate offense.
    c. In addition to the civil penalties set forth in  subdivision  b  of
  this  section  and except as otherwise specifically provided, any person
  who knowingly violates or fails to comply with  any  provision  of  this
  chapter  and chapter four of this title or any order, rule or regulation
  issued by the commissioner or board or with the conditions of any permit
  issued by the commissioner shall be guilty of a  misdemeanor  and,  upon
  conviction  thereof,  shall  be  punished by a fine of not less than two
  hundred fifty nor more than one thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not
  exceeding thirty days, or both  for  each  violation,  except  that  the
  punishment  for  the  removal of a manhole cover in violation of section
  24-304 shall be a fine of not less than five hundred  dollars  nor  more
  than ten thousand dollars, or imprisonment not exceeding thirty days, or
  both  for  each  violation.  In  the case of a continuing violation each
  day's continuance shall be a separate and distinct offense.
    d. 1. In the case of any continued or knowing violation of any of  the
  provisions  of this chapter and chapter four of this title or any order,
  rule or regulation issued  by  the  board  or  commissioner  or  of  the
  conditions  of  any permit issued by the commissioner within the city of
  New York or where the board finds that the  violation  of  any  of  such
  provisions  or  of  the  conditions  of  any such permit presents or may
  present a danger to the water supply or the  water  supply  system,  the
  board  after notice and the opportunity for a hearing in accordance with
  the rules and regulations of the board, may issue  a  cease  and  desist
  order  requiring  any  person  who  owns,  leases, operates, controls or
  supervises  any  building,  structure,  facility,   device,   equipment,
  installation  or  operation  to  cease  and  desist from any activity or

  process which causes or is conducted  so  as  to  cause  such  violation
  within the time specified in such order.
    2. Such order may provide that if the order is not complied with or so
  far  complied  with  as the commissioner of environmental protection may
  regard as reasonable within the time specified therein, the commissioner
  may take such action as shall be specified therein,  including  but  not
  limited to:
    (a)  sealing,  blocking  or  inactivating  any  equipment, facility or
  device; or
    (b) terminating the water supply.
    For such purpose the commissioner or his or her deputies or such other
  officers or employees as are designated by the commissioner may enter on
  any public or private property.
    e. 1. Whenever the commissioner has reasonable cause to believe that a
  violation of the provisions of this chapter and  chapter  four  of  this
  title  or  any  order,  rule  or  regulation  issued  by  the  board  or
  commissioner or in violation of the conditions of any permit  issued  by
  the  commissioner  within  the city of New York creates or may create an
  imminent danger to the water supply or to the water supply system or  to
  the  public health or to the life or safety of persons, the commissioner
  may issue a cease and  desist  order  requiring  any  person  who  owns,
  leases,  operates,  controls  or  supervises  any  building,  structure,
  facility, device, equipment, installation  or  operation  to  take  such
  action as may be necessary to halt or prevent such violation.
    2.  If  service  of  the  order cannot be made personally because such
  person cannot be located at such  time  then  service  may  be  made  by
  delivering  a  copy  to  a  person of suitable age and discretion at the
  residence or place of business of the person sought  to  be  served.  If
  service  cannot  be  made  personally or by such delivery to a person of
  suitable age and discretion because of inability to locate or to  obtain
  the  name or address of such person at such time, service may be made by
  conspicuously posting a copy of such order upon the property to which it
  relates. The posting of such order shall be sufficient  notice  of  such
  order  to  all  persons  having  a  duty  in  relation thereto under the
  provisions of this subdivision.
    3. If the order is not complied with or so far complied  with  as  the
  commissioner may regard as reasonable, within the time specified therein
  the commissioner may act to halt or prevent such violation by:
    (a)   sealing,  blocking  or  otherwise  inactivating  any  equipment,
  facility or device;
    (b) terminating the water supply; or
    (c)  any  other  means  or  method  that  is  reasonable   under   the
  circumstances.  For such purpose the commissioner or his or her deputies
  or  such  other  officers  or  employees  as  are  designated   by   the
  commissioner may enter on any public or private property.
    4.  Any  person affected by such an order may make written application
  to the environmental control board for a hearing. Such hearing shall  be
  provided,  pursuant to the rules and regulations of the board, and shall
  be held within forty-eight hours after the receipt of such  application.
  The board may suspend, modify or terminate such order.
    f.  If  the  respondent  fails  to comply with any order issued by the
  board or commissioner or with the conditions of any permit, or the board
  or commissioner otherwise deems it necessary, the  corporation  counsel,
  acting  in the name of the city, may maintain an action or proceeding in
  a court of competent jurisdiction to compel compliance with or  restrain
  by  injunction  the violation of any order or permit issued by the board
  or commissioner.

    g. Any person who  violates  or  fails  to  comply  with  any  of  the
  provisions  of this chapter and chapter four of this title or any order,
  rule or regulation or with the conditions of any permit  issued  by  the
  commissioner shall be liable to the city for any expense, loss or damage
  suffered by the city by reason of such violation.
    h.  Unless  otherwise  specifically provided, service of any notice or
  order may be made either personally or by mail  addressed  to  the  last
  known address of the person to be served.
