Section 24-366

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;   24-366   Assessment  of  electric  generation  viability.  a.  The
  department shall undertake a resource assessment of the  city's  potable
  water  supply and wastewater treatment systems and the natural bodies of
  water within the city's jurisdiction to determine the potential of  such
  systems  and  bodies  of water for generating electricity. In performing
  such assessment the department  shall  include  an  examination  of  the
  potential  to  construct and operate energy generating facilities within
  such systems and natural bodies of water; the means for transmitting the
  electricity   generated;   the   need   to   construct    and    operate
  generation-related  infrastructure;  grid-connection  issues; generation
  system installation and maintenance costs; and risks to the operation of
  water supply and wastewater treatment  systems  and  natural  bodies  of
  water posed by energy-generating facilities.
    b.  The  department shall conduct a technological review of in-conduit
  and free-flow hydropower  technologies  that  are  appropriate  for  the
  pressure  and  water flow rates for each site identified in the resource
  assessment.
    c. With  information  gathered  during  the  resource  assessment  and
  technological  review, the department shall conduct an economic analysis
  to determine the economic viability of generating electricity  for  each
  site identified in the resource assessment.
    d. The resource assessment, technological review and economic analysis
  shall  be  completed within eighteen months of the effective date of the
  local law that added this section and shall be submitted  to  the  mayor
  and the speaker of the council.
