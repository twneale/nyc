Section 24-803

<pre>
    
 
    &sect;24-803  Reduction  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  that contribute to
  global warming. a. (1) Reduction of emissions citywide. There shall  be,
  at minimum, a thirty percent reduction in citywide emissions by calendar
  year  2030,  relative  to  such emissions for the base year for citywide
  emissions.
    (2)  The  emissions  reduction  required  by  paragraph  one  of  this
  subdivision  shall be achieved through the applicable policies, programs
  and actions included in PlaNYC, and any  additional  policies,  programs
  and actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global
  warming.  If  the office determines that such emissions reduction is not
  feasible despite the best efforts of city government, such office  shall
  report  such findings and make recommendations with respect to policies,
  programs and actions that may be undertaken to achieve such reductions.
    b. Reduction of emissions from city government operations.  (1)  There
  shall  be,  at  minimum,  a  thirty percent reduction in city government
  emissions by calendar year 2017, relative to such emissions for the base
  year for city government emissions.
    (2)  The  emissions  reduction  required  by  paragraph  one  of  this
  subdivision  shall be achieved through the applicable policies, programs
  and actions included in PlaNYC, and any  additional  policies,  programs
  and actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global
  warming.  If  the office determines that such emissions reduction is not
  feasible despite the best efforts of city government, such office  shall
  report  such findings and make recommendations with respect to policies,
  programs and actions that may be undertaken to achieve such reductions.
    c. Carbon dioxide equivalent emission inventories. (1) No  later  than
  September 17, 2008, and no later than every September 17 thereafter, the
  office  shall complete and post on its website an inventory and analysis
  of citywide emissions measured in  carbon  dioxide  equivalent  for  the
  previous  calendar  year,  and  shall calculate the percentage change in
  citywide emissions  measured  in  carbon  dioxide  equivalent  for  such
  calendar year, relative to such emissions for the base year for citywide
  emissions.
    (2)  No  later  than  September  17,  2008,  and  no  later than every
  September 17 thereafter, the office  shall  complete  and  post  on  its
  website  an inventory and analysis of city government emissions measured
  in carbon dioxide equivalent for the fiscal year ending in the  previous
  calendar  year,  and  shall  calculate  the  percentage  change  in city
  government emissions measured in  carbon  dioxide  equivalent  for  such
  calendar  year,  relative  to  such emissions for the base year for city
  government emissions.
    d. Voluntary global warming emissions reduction program. The effort to
  reduce citywide emissions set forth in subdivision  a  of  this  section
  shall  include,  but not be limited to, voluntary programs developed and
  implemented no later than March 1, 2009, that encourage private entities
  operating within the city of New York to commit to  reducing  their  own
  greenhouse  gas  emissions measured in carbon dioxide equivalent to help
  facilitate the citywide emissions reduction effort.
