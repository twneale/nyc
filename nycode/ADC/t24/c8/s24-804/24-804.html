<pre>
    
 
    &sect;  24-804  Education  and outreach. a. No later than July 1, 2009, the
  office shall develop and implement programs  for  public  education  and
  outreach  regarding  global  warming and the reduction of greenhouse gas
  emissions by residents, businesses, public and  private  elementary  and
  secondary  schools, and other entities within the city of New York. Such
  program shall include,  but  not  be  limited  to,  awareness  campaigns
  tailored  to  specific  sectors  of the public, through which the office
  shall develop and  disseminate  information  regarding  global  warming,
  including  its  potential  impacts  on  the  city  of New York, and best
  practices to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.
    b. The New York city renewable energy  portal.  1.  The  office  shall
  develop  and  administer an interactive website called the New York city
  renewable energy portal. A link to the renewable energy portal shall  be
  prominently  displayed on the website of the department of buildings and
  any other city agency website that pertains  to  sustainable  growth  or
  environmental policy.
    2.  The purpose of the renewable energy portal shall be to effectively
  inform the public  about  the  feasibility  and  economic  viability  of
  installing  renewable energy systems in the city of New York. Content on
  the website shall be written in plain  language  whenever  possible  and
  shall  include, but not be limited to, information on solar photovoltaic
  panels, solar water heaters, geothermal heat pumps,  and  leadership  in
  energy  and environmental design (LEED) certification. Links featured on
  the website shall be verified on a quarterly basis.
    3. The renewable energy portal shall have or link to,  to  the  extent
  they  are  available,  programs  that  allow  the  user to calculate the
  estimated costs and benefits  of  renewable  energy  systems,  lists  of
  financial  incentives available at the federal, state, and local levels,
  and tools and guidelines  to  evaluate  the  feasibility  of  installing
  renewable energy technologies.
    4. The renewable energy portal shall assist users in determining which
  city,  state,  and  federal agencies, if any, must approve a prospective
  installation of renewable energy systems. The  renewable  energy  portal
  shall  link  to  the  website of any city, state, or federal agency that
  must be contacted in  connection  with  the  installation  of  renewable
  energy  systems,  and  may also link to any forms, if they are available
  online, that such  agency  may  require  of  prospective  installers  of
  renewable energy systems.
    5.  The renewable energy portal shall list the qualifications required
  for any contractor to perform installations of renewable energy  systems
  within the city of New York.
    6.  Nothing  within  this  section  shall  be  construed  to limit the
  authority of the  office  to  create  additional  resources  within  the
  renewable energy portal.
