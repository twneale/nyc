Section 24-406

<pre>
    
 
    *  &sect;  24-406  Removal  of  electric wires; Manhattan and the Bronx. a.
  After the grade of any street in the boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx
  shall have been finally determined and  established,  whenever,  in  the
  opinion  of  the board of estimate it shall be practicable to remove the
  electrical conductors  above  ground  in  such  street  and  place  them
  underground,  the commissioner of transportation shall notify the owners
  or operators of such conductors. Notice shall be to the effect that such
  electrical conductors must be removed within a certain time,  sufficient
  for removal, which shall be fixed by such commissioner. In the case of a
  corporation  duly  authorized  to  lay and operate electrical conductors
  underground in such street, the time shall be sufficient for the  proper
  laying  of  conductors  underground  in  place  of those removed. b. All
  electrical conductors authorized to be placed underground, shall  be  so
  placed  under  and  in accordance with the provisions of sections 24-410
  through 24-415 of the code. Whenever application shall be  made  to  the
  commissioner  of  transportation  for  permission  to  place underground
  electrical conductors in any such street, if such permission be granted,
  the  subways  therefor  shall  be  constructed  or  provided,  and  such
  electrical  conductors  placed  underground under and in accordance with
  the provisions of such sections. Such permission shall be  granted  only
  in accordance with the provisions of such sections.
