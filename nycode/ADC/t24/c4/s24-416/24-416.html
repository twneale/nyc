Section 24-416

<pre>
    
 
    *  &sect;  24-416  Underground  electrical conductors; Brooklyn, Queens and
  Richmond. Whenever the board of estimate, after hearing all the  parties
  interested,  shall deem it desirable and practicable that the electrical
  conductors above ground in any  street  in  the  boroughs  of  Brooklyn,
  Queens   and  Richmond,  be  placed  underground,  the  commissioner  of
  transportation shall notify the owners or operators of  such  electrical
  conductors.  The  notice  shall  be  to  the effect that such electrical
  conductors shall be placed underground within a certain time, sufficient
  for the proper construction of underground conduits or other channels in
  such street, to  be  fixed  by  such  commissioner.  Whenever  any  duly
  authorized   company   operating  or  intending  to  operate  electrical
  conductors in any such street, shall desire to place its  conductors  or
  any  of  them  underground,  it shall be obligatory upon such company to
  file with the commissioner of transportation a map or  maps  made  to  a
  scale,  showing  the  streets  which  are  desired  to  be used for such
  purpose, and giving the general location, dimensions and course  of  the
  underground  conduit  desired to be constructed. Before any such conduit
  shall be constructed it shall be necessary to obtain the approval of the
  commissioner of transportation of such plan of construction so proposed,
  and such commissioner shall have power  to  require  that  the  work  of
  removal  and of constructing every such system of underground conductors
  shall be done according to such plan so approved.
