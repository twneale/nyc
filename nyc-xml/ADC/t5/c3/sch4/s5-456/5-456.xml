    shall be annexed thereto a statement of the amounts, if any, previously taxed, to whom the same were payable and the date of such taxation. A notice shall be published in the City Record, for ten days, of the time and place of taxing such costs, charges
    and expenses, which shall be thereupon taxed by a justice of the supreme court, or by a referee under his or her special order. b. All such costs and expenses or disbursements shall be stated in detail in the bill of costs, charges and expenses, and
    shall be accompanied by such proof of the reasonableness and necessity thereof as is now required by law and the practice of the court upon taxation of costs and disbursements in other special proceedings or actions in such court.
