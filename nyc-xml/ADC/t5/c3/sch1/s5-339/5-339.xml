  <text>§ 5-339 Title acquired for streets; subject to rights of railroads. The city may acquire for street purposes title in fee or to an easement, as may be determined by the mayor to any real property heretofore acquired through purchase or condemnation
    by any railroad corporation in the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens for its corporate purposes and which real property lies within the lines of, is adjacent to, adjoins or separates any street or any part or parts thereof, now or hereafter laid out
    upon the city map, where the state commissioner of transportation certifies that the ownership or exclusive use of such real property or easement thereover is no longer necessary to the carrying out of such corporate purposes. Such title or easement,
    however, shall be acquired by the city subject to the right of the corporation to continue to use such real property during the term of its corporate existence and for its corporate purposes, or in lieu thereof to use for a like term and like purposes
    such other portion of the streets within which such real property shall lie, as the public service commission shall designate.</text>
