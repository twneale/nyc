    may be necessary, or to cause other property to be included therein, and to direct such further notices to be given to any party in interest, as it deems proper. If, in any particular, it shall, at any time, be found necessary to amend any pleading
    or proceeding, or supply any defect therein, arising in the course of any special proceeding authorized by this subchapter, the same may be amended or supplied in such manner as shall be directed by the supreme court, which is hereby authorized to
