  <text>ยง 3-502 Permits. In all cases where provision is made by law that the consent of a borough president shall be obtained to authorize any act to be done, he or she may grant a permit therefor, subject to the restrictions of all laws in relation thereto.
    Upon granting any such permit, the borough president may exact such cash deposit or bond, or both, as he or she may deem necessary to safeguard the interests of the city.
