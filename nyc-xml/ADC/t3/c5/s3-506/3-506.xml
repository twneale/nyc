  <text>ยง 3-506 Borough presidents to adjust numbering. In all cases where a street shall have been numbered or renumbered, the borough president having jurisdiction shall thereafter adjust and renumber such street as the same may be required from time to time.
    In numbering and renumbering houses, the borough president shall leave sufficient numbers on each block, so that, under any circumstances, there would be but one block where a change would be required, in case of renumbering at any subsequent time.</text>
