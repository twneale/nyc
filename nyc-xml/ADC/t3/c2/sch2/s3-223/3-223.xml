    required by this subchapter shall be charged a late filing penalty of ten dollars for each day a required statement or report is late. If more than one statement or report is late, the total late filing penalty shall be equal to the sum of ten dollars

    factors into account in determining whether a waiver or reduction is appropriate: (i) whether and how often the lobbyist or client has filed late in the past; (ii) the annual operating budget of the lobbyist or client; (iii) whether the lobbyist lobbies
    solely on its own behalf; (iv) for periodic reports, the number of lobbying matters, number of hours spent working on those matters, and amount of compensation and expenditures that were not reported during the relevant period; and (v) the significance
    of the impediments to timely filing faced by the lobbyist or client. * NB Effective May 16, 2014 (d) Any person or organization who violates any provision of this subchapter not punishable under subdivisions (a), (b) or (c) of this section shall be

    not be imposed or issued. (f) The amount of any assessment made or duration of order issued pursuant to this section shall be determined only after a hearing at which the party shall be entitled to appear and be heard. Any assessment imposed under

    deems such to be wilful, to report such determination to the department of investigation. Where the city clerk receives a report or otherwise suspects that a criminal violation of law, other than a violation of this subchapter, has been or may have
    been committed, the city clerk shall report any information relating thereto to the department of investigation. (h) The department of investigation shall provide assistance to the city clerk for the purpose of training personnel who are responsible

    time on or after December tenth, two thousand six. (2) Any lobbyist or client intending to participate in the amnesty program may file a written notice of intent to participate with the city clerk on forms prescribed by the city clerk, stating his,
    her or its intention to participate in such program, at any time prior to the effective date of the amnesty program. The city clerk shall not assess any late filing penalties or any civil penalties authorized by this section that could be assessed
    against any such lobbyist or client for the period from December tenth, two thousand six to the date of the filing of such notice. Any lobbyist or client filing a notice pursuant to this paragraph shall comply with all applicable provisions of this
    subchapter beginning on the day of such filing. (3) Any lobbyist or client intending to participate in the amnesty program, including any lobbyist or client who has filed a notice pursuant to paragraph two of this subdivision, shall file a written
    application on forms prescribed by the city clerk on or after the effective date of the amnesty program, but prior to the expiration of such program. Such application shall include a summary, which shall meet the requirements of the city clerk, of
    the lobbying activities, fundraising activities or political consulting activities performed by such lobbyist or received by such client from one year prior to the effective date of the amnesty program until the date of such application or valid filing
    pursuant to paragraph two of this subdivision. Such amnesty program shall provide that upon the filing of such application and upon compliance with all applicable provisions of this subchapter, the city clerk shall waive any late filing penalties
    and any civil penalties authorized by this section that could be assessed against any such lobbyist or client for the period from December tenth, two thousand six to the date of the filing of such application or, if the lobbyist or client made a valid
    filing pursuant to paragraph two of this subdivision, to the date of such filing. In addition, any such lobbyist or client shall not be subject to any criminal penalties authorized by this section for the period from December tenth, two thousand six

    by rule of the city clerk shall not exceed six months, after which no application for amnesty shall be accepted. Prior to the commencement of, and during the term of, the amnesty program, the city clerk shall publicize the amnesty program so as to
    maximize public awareness of and participation in such program. The city clerk shall consult with city agencies and the city council to develop notices and advertisements to be placed in print and electronic media that are intended to reach persons
    and organizations doing business with the city. (5) Notwithstanding any provision of this subdivision to the contrary, any lobbyist or client who is the subject of any criminal investigation relating to any violation of this subchapter and any lobbyist
    or client who is a party to any criminal litigation in any court of this state or the United States relating to any violation of this subchapter shall be ineligible to file the notice pursuant to paragraph two of this subdivision or the application
    pursuant to paragraph three of this subdivision or to otherwise receive relief from late filing penalties, or civil or criminal penalties under the amnesty program established pursuant to this subdivision. (6) The city clerk shall promulgate such
    rules, issue forms and instructions, and take any and all other actions necessary to implement the provisions of this subdivision. * NB Effective May 16, 2014</text>
