    may have committed a crime within the city. In such proclamation, the mayor may offer a reward not exceeding five hundred dollars for the apprehension of any such person and not exceeding ten thousand dollars for the apprehension and conviction of
    any such person, provided, however, that the mayor may offer a reward not exceeding one hundred thousand dollars for the apprehension and conviction of any person found guilty in connection with an act of terrorism involving loss of life or substantial
    injury to persons or property. Any such reward shall be paid out of the city treasury upon a certificate of the mayor that the service required has been performed. For purposes of this section, "terrorism" means premeditated, politically motivated
