    particular to that emergency: a. the installation of back-up power capability, including but not limited to the consideration of the effectiveness of installing solar power and other alternative energy sources with respect to street lights and traffic
    control signals to keep the roadway network functioning to the maximum possible extent during power outages; b. alternative transportation options provided by governmental and/or private entities to be used in the event of subway service and/or major
    roadway shutdowns, including but not limited to expanded bus and ferry service; c. alternative bus routing, including but not limited to criteria for the closing of streets to all traffic except buses; d. the expanded use of vehicles licensed by the
    taxi and limousine commission; e. some accessible transportation options for persons with special needs; f. closing or partially closing certain streets or designating that one or more lanes of traffic on such streets are closed to traffic except
    for emergency vehicles and/or vehicles driven by certain individuals involved in rescue, recovery and clean-up operations; g. where appropriate, recommending to the appropriate state transportation authorities the elimination or reduction of fares
    on buses, subways and ferries; and h. a mechanism to provide that, to the extent practicable, all public communications, written or otherwise, are available in the most commonly spoken languages of affected communities.</text>
