  <text>§ 30-104 Food and water access plan. In consultation with appropriate federal, state, and city government agencies, the commissioner shall develop or update, no later than December first, two thousand thirteen, a food and water access plan to be utilized
    after coastal storms and other severe weather and natural disaster events where such events may disrupt access to food and water or may impact the ability to purchase, prepare or consume food or water. Such plan shall include, but not be limited to
    the following features, provided that nothing herein shall be construed to interfere with the ability of agencies responding to an emergency to implement plans, modify plans, or take steps not described in any written plan, in a manner appropriate
    to circumstances particular to that emergency: a. a description of how the city will provide access to food and water, including but not limited to how and to what extent the city will disseminate information to the public about the availability of
    food and water services; manage requests for support from emergency, not-for-profit entities that provide food and water; arrange for or coordinate disaster feeding; coordinate the efforts of food benefits programs, food donations, food business and
    emergency food providers; and work to restore the public, private and non-profit sectors' ability to provide access to food and water; b. a mechanism to assess the city's food and water needs prior to and after such conditions and incidents arise;
    c. a description of how the city personnel responsible for implementing such plan will be identified, including how a clear hierarchy and points of contact of such personnel will be established; d. criteria for how food and water distribution points
    are identified and how such distribution points will be publicized to ensure that the public is aware of the locations of such distribution points; e. a mechanism to provide that recipients of food benefits have continued access to such benefits during
    and immediately after such events and that affected communities experiencing transportation disruptions can access emergency food benefits locally; f. identification of contracts, if any, that can be activated during and immediately after such events
    for vendors that can provide and distribute food and water, including but not limited to, hot food providers, trucks and drivers; g. criteria for assessing transportation routes that allow for the distribution of food and water that accounts for emergency
    road and bridge closures; h. a mechanism to provide that, to the extent practicable, all public communications, written or otherwise, are available in the most commonly spoken languages of affected communities; and i. a mechanism to consult community
    based organizations and service providers with relevant expertise in regard to the development of such plan.
