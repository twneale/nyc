  <text>ยง 1-103 Effect of local law. This chapter shall not operate to deprive the local legislative body of the city of New York of the power to enact local laws in relation to any matter in respect to which such power would otherwise exist, nor shall it limit
    such power. If this power otherwise exists, any provision of this chapter may be superseded, supplemented or amended by local law in the same manner and to the same extent as such provisions could be superseded, supplemented or amended had this chapter
    not been enacted.</text>
