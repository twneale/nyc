  <text>* ยง 21-502 Transitional jobs program. a. The mayor shall direct the commissioner to establish a transitional jobs program, which shall consist of a total of two thousand five hundred temporary jobs in the public sector and in community-based organizations,
    at least two-thirds of which shall be created within local government agencies in the public sector. Such total number of two thousand five hundred temporary jobs shall exist for a period of thirty-six months, commencing on January first, two thousand
    one; provided, however, that each participant in the transitional jobs program shall only be employed by a sponsoring or affiliated organization for a period not to exceed twelve months, and that each specific job created pursuant to the transitional
    jobs program shall be retained for at least twelve months. An initial group of two thousand five hundred participants shall commence employment on January first, two thousand one. A second group of two thousand five hundred participants shall commence
    employment on January first, two thousand two, and a final group of two thousand five hundred participants shall commence employment on January first, two thousand three. b. The jobs created in local government agencies pursuant to this chapter shall,
    consistent with applicable collective bargaining laws and agreements, be accreted to appropriate existing collective bargaining units. c. In implementing the transitional jobs program, the mayor shall direct the commissioner to select which local
    government agencies shall be sponsoring organizations. In making such determination, the commissioner may work in cooperation with the commissioners of other local government agencies and may, consistent with obligations under collective bargaining
    laws and agreements, consult with the heads of collective bargaining organizations, and may consider each prospective agency's prior experience hiring welfare recipients and the unemployed, its prior experience assisting such individuals in finding
    jobs, its prior experience providing education and training, career counseling, and related services to its employees, its plans to address or fulfill the needs of communities throughout the city of New York, its plans to employ or facilitate the
    employment of certified individuals, its plans to provide case management to participants, and its plans to assist in the permanent placement of participants following their participation in the transitional jobs program. d. In meeting the goal of
    placing participants in community based organizations pursuant to this chapter, the mayor may direct the commissioner to issue a request for proposals or to utilize any other procurement method that he or she deems necessary to select community-based
    organizations to become sponsoring organizations. To determine which community-based organizations shall become sponsoring organizations, the commissioner may consider an organization's prior experience hiring welfare recipients and the unemployed,
    its prior experience assisting such individuals in finding jobs, its prior experience providing education and training, career counseling, and related services to its employees, its plans to address or fulfill the needs of communities throughout the
    city of New York, its plans to employ or facilitate the employment of certified individuals, its plans to provide case management to participants, and its plans to assist in the permanent placement of participants following their participation in
    the transitional jobs program. Where the employees of a community-based organization that has been selected to become a sponsoring or affiliated organization are members of a collective bargaining unit, such collective bargaining unit shall, consistent
    with applicable collective bargaining laws and agreements, have the opportunity to comment on such selection. The commissioner shall respond to such comments within fifteen days of their receipt. e. Each sponsoring or affiliated organization may employ
    any certified individual, and employment with a sponsoring or affiliated organization shall be for a period not to exceed twelve months. f. The sponsoring organizations shall provide each participant with the necessary case management to enable the
    participant to succeed in the transitional jobs program, build his or her job skills, and enhance his or her chances of securing permanent employment after participating in the transitional jobs program. * NB Declared invalid by NYS Supreme Court
