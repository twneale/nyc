    means of enabling him or her to reimburse the city, an action may be maintained in a court of competent jurisdiction, by such commissioner, against such person or his or her estate to recover such sums of money as may have been expended by the city
    through such commissioner in the support or care or treatment of such person during the period of ten years next preceding such discovery or the death of such person. b. Instead of bringing the legal proceedings as in this section specified, such
    commissioner may determine the reasonable value of such support or care or treatment, and enter into an agreement for its payment.
