    title eleven of the code as such provisions pertain to such relocation. (1) In the case of a business that has relocated once, all eligible aggregate employment shares are apportioned to the premises to which the single relocation took place. In the
    case of a business that has relocated more than once, eligible aggregate employment shares are apportioned as follows: (i) If in a taxable year, the sum for all eligible premises of the lesser of the amounts determined pursuant to paragraphs one and

    for each particular eligible premises is greater than the total number of eligible aggregate employment shares determined pursuant to such subdivision (i), the number of shares apportioned to a particular eligible premises shall be such total number

    for one or more relocations in an eligible business' latest year of relocation as determined pursuant to subdivision (j) of this section, the amount, if any, by which the number of aggregate employment shares maintained by the eligible business in

    or (B) for one or more relocations in a specified year of relocation that is not the latest such year of relocation by an eligible business, the amount, if any, by which the number of aggregate employment shares maintained by the eligible business
    in the eligible area in the taxable year in which it is claiming the credit authorized by this chapter exceeds the sum of (I) the number of total attributed eligible aggregate employment shares that are attributed in the taxable year in which the
    credit is claimed to relocations that took place in years of relocation later than the specified year of relocation and (II) the number of aggregate employment shares maintained by it in the eligible area in the taxable year immediately preceding
    such specified year of relocation. (ii) In the case of an eligible business that has relocated more than once in the same taxable year, the limitation amount determined in accordance with subparagraph (i) of this paragraph shall be applied to such

    thereof, from a relocation or relocations that took place in a specified year of relocation shall be attributed in reverse chronological order to any relocations that took place in earlier years of relocation. (ii) Notwithstanding subparagraph (i)
    of this paragraph, (A) no excess shares may be attributed to a relocation unless the number of eligible aggregate employment shares apportioned pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision to such relocation for the taxable year in which the credit
    is claimed is less than the highest number of total attributed eligible aggregate employment shares pertaining to such relocation in any taxable year prior to the taxable year in which the credit is claimed; (B) the sum of the number of shares attributed
    to such relocation pursuant to subparagraph (i) of this paragraph and the eligible aggregate employment shares apportioned to any such relocation pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision may not exceed such highest number of total attributed
    eligible aggregate employment shares; and (C) such sum may not exceed the limitation amount for such relocation defined in paragraph two of this subdivision. (4) Notwithstanding the provisions of other paragraphs of this subdivision, any excess shares
    that are apportioned pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision to a relocation to particular eligible premises that are not located in a revitalization area as defined in subdivision (n) of this section, but are attributed pursuant to paragraph
    three of this subdivision to particular eligible premises that are located in such a revitalization area, shall be treated as if such premises to which they are attributed were not in such a revitalization area. (p) "Particular premises" means all
