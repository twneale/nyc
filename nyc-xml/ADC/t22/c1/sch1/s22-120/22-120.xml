  <text>ยง 22-120 Commissioner may remove abandoned wharf structures. a. Whenever any pier, bulkhead, platform or other wharf structure shall be abandoned and constitute an obstruction to navigation, the commissioner shall notify the owner of such property,
    if known to him or her, to remove the same forthwith. If the owner is unknown, or is not within the city, or shall fail to comply with such notice, the commissioner shall cause such obstruction to be removed. The expense of such removal shall be recoverable
    by action from the owner and shall be a lien on the property so removed until paid. b. If such property is unclaimed within thirty days after removal, the commissioner shall advertise the same for sale, at public auction to the highest bidder, in
    the City Record for six days. The proceeds of each such sale shall be paid into the general fund.</text>
