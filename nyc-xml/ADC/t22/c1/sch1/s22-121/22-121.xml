  <text>ยง 22-121 Maintenance of a drift- and debris-free harbor. a. As used in this section the following terms shall have the following meanings: 1. "Debris" means any substance or material, whether on land or water, which is capable of becoming drift. 2.
    "Drift" means any substance or material, floatable or otherwise, which may cause damage to any vessel or craft or which may otherwise obstruct, impede or endanger the navigable capacity of the navigable waters of the city or cause any other condition
    hazardous to the life or safety of persons using such waters, including but not limited to piles, lumber, timber, driftwood, dirt, ashes, cinders, mud, sand, dredged materials, or refuse of any kind. 3. "Navigable waters" means the waterways which
    are capable of carrying commerce, and the tributaries thereto, within the geographical limits of the city. 4. "Owner" means a person having title to any premises or structure; a tenant, lessee or occupant; a mortgagee or vendee in possession; a trustee
    in bankruptcy; a receiver or any other person having legal ownership or control of any premises or structure. 5. "Premises" means any land or land under water and improvements or appurtenances or any part thereof including but not limited to any structure.
    6. "Structure" means anything built or constructed including but not limited to a building, wharf, pier, dolphin, boom, weir, breakwater, bulkhead, jetty, derelict vessel, ship, barge, raft or floating craft of any kind. b. Whenever the commissioner
    determines that material of any kind placed or deposited on any premises located on or along the shores or banks of any navigable water may be or become a source of drift or debris liable to be washed into such navigable water by any cause whatsoever
    or that because of the deteriorated or deteriorating condition of any premises or structure located on or along the banks or shores of any navigable water such premises or structure may be or become a source of drift or debris liable to be washed
    into such water by any cause whatsoever and thereby cause damage to vessels or craft or otherwise obstruct, impede or endanger the navigable capacity of such water or cause any other condition hazardous to the life or safety of persons using such
    water, the commissioner may declare the same to be a public nuisance and order the owner of such premises or structure to remove, repair, reconstruct, alter or abate it as such order shall specify. It shall be the duty of an owner upon whom such an
    order has been served to remove, repair, reconstruct, alter or abate such public nuisance in the manner and in the time provided by such order. c. 1. An order of the commissioner issued pursuant to subdivision b of this section shall specify the work
    to be performed and shall fix a reasonable time for compliance but not less than thirty days from the date of service of such order. Such order shall contain a statement that upon the failure of the owner to comply with the commissioner's order within
    the stated time, the department may perform the work specified in the order or apply for a court order directing the owner to comply with the commissioner's order or directing the department to perform the work specified in the commissioner's order.
    Such statement shall also indicate that if the department performs any of the work specified in the commissioner's order, the expense incurred by the department in performing such work shall be a debt recoverable from the owner and a lien on the premises
    with respect to which such order was issued. 2. Service of such order shall be made upon the owner personally or by certified mail addressed to the last known address of such person or in any manner provided for service of process by article three
    of the civil practice law and rules. The commisssioner may serve a copy of such order on any mortgagee or lienor of record in the same manner. 3. A copy of such order shall be filed with the office of the register in the county in which the premises
    with respect to which such order was issued are situated. 4. Within thirty days after service of such order upon an owner, such owner or a mortgagee or lienor upon whom a copy of such order has been served may request a hearing. At such hearing such
    person shall be entitled to be represented by counsel and to present evidence. The commissioner may affirm, modify or revoke the order. d. If the owner fails to comply with the commissioner's order within the time fixed for compliance pursuant to
    subdivision c of this section, the department may perform the work specified in the order. e. As an alternative to the remedy set forth in subdivision d of this section, if an owner fails to comply with the commissioner's order within the time fixed
    for compliance pursuant to subdivision c of this section, the commissioner may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction, upon such notice and in such manner as the court shall direct, for an order directing the owner to comply with the commissioner's
    order or directing the department to perform the work specified in the commissioner's order. f. The procedures set forth in subdivisions c, d and e shall not apply to the abatement of a nuisance with respect to any structure not affixed to real property,
    including but not limited to any derelict vessel, ship, barge, raft or floating craft of any kind. The commissioner shall provide for the abatement of a nuisance with respect to such structures pursuant to the procedures set forth in sections 22-109,
    22-110 and 22-111 of this subchapter. g. 1. The expense of the department with respect to any work performed by or on behalf of the department pursuant to subdivisions d and e of this section shall be a debt recoverable from the owner and a lien upon
    the premises with respect to which such work was performed. 2. The department shall keep a record of all work performed by or on behalf of the department. Such records shall be accessible to the public during business hours. Within thirty days after
    the issuance of a purchase or work order for such work, such order shall be entered on the records of the department. Such entry shall constitute notice to all parties. 3. All such expenses shall constitute a lien upon the premises when the amount
    thereof shall have been definitely computed as a statement of account by the department and the department shall cause to be filed in the office of the city collector an entry of the account stated in the book in which such charges against the premises
    are to be entered. Such lien shall have a priority over all other liens and encumbrances on the premises except for the lien of taxes and assessments. However, no lien created pursuant to this section shall be enforced against a subsequent purchaser
    in good faith or mortgagee in good faith unless such transaction occurred after the date of entry of a purchase or work order on the records of the department pursuant to paragraph two of this subdivision. 4. A notice thereof stating the amount due
    and the nature of the charge shall be mailed by the city collector within five days after such entry to the last known address of the person whose name appears on the records in the office of the city collector as being the owner or agent or as the
    person designated by the owner to receive tax bills or, where no name appears, to the premises, addressed to either the owner or the agent. Such notice shall have stamped or printed thereon a reference to this section. 5. If such charge is not paid
    within thirty days from the date of entry, it shall be the duty of the city collector to receive interest thereon at the rate of interest applicable to such property for a delinquent tax on real property to be calculated to the date of payment from
    the date of entry. 6. Such charge and the interest thereon shall continue to be, until paid, a lien on the premises. Such charge and interest may be collected and the lien thereof may be foreclosed in the manner provided by law for the collection
    and foreclosure of taxes, sewer rents, sewer surcharges and water charges due and payable to the city and the provisions of chapter four of title eleven of the code shall apply to such charges and the interest thereon and the lien thereof. 7. (1)
    In any proceedings to enforce or discharge the lien, the validity of the lien shall not be subject to challenge based on (i) the lawfulness of the work done; or (ii) the propriety and accuracy of the items of expenses for which a lien is claimed,
    except as provided in this paragraph. (2) No such challenge may be made except by (a) the owner of the property, or (b) a mortgagee or lienor whose mortgage or lien would but for the provisions of this section have priority over the department's lien.
    (3) An issue specified in subparagraph one which was decided or could have been contested in a prior court proceeding to secure a court order pursuant to subdivision e of this section shall not be open to re-examination, but if any mortgagee or lienor
    of record was not served with an order of the commissioner pursuant to paragraph two of subdivision c and with notice of such proceeding, his or her mortgage or lien shall have the same priority over the lien of the department that it would have had
    but for the provisions of this section. 8. In addition to establishing a lien, the department may recover such expenses and interest by bringing an action against the owner. The institution of such action shall not suspend or bar the right to pursue
    any other remedy provided by law for the recovery of such debt.</text>
