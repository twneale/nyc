  <text>§ 22-264 Registration of labor union and labor organization; disqualification from office-holding. a. A labor union or labor organization representing or seeking to represent employees directly involved in the movement, handling or sale of goods sold
    in any public wholesale market in the city of New York shall, within the time period prescribed by the commissioner, register with the commissioner and shall disclose such information to the commissioner as the commissioner may by rule require, including
    but not limited to the names of all officers and agents of such union or organization; provided, however, that this section shall not apply: (i) to a labor union that represents or seeks to represent fewer than two hundred employees in any public
    wholesale market or combination of public wholesale markets in the city of New York; (ii) to a labor union representing or seeking to represent clerical or other office workers, construction or electrical workers or any other workers temporarily or
    permanently employed in a public wholesale market for a purpose not directly related to the movement, handling or sale of goods in such market; (iii) to affiliated national or international labor unions of local labor unions required to register pursuant
    to this provision; and provided, further, that no labor union or labor organization shall be required to furnish information pursuant to this section which is already included in a report filed by such labor union or labor organization with the Secretary
    of Labor pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 431 et seq. or § 1001 et seq. if a copy of such report, or of the portion thereof containing such information, is furnished to the commissioner. b. An officer of a labor union or labor organization required to be registered
    with the commissioner pursuant to subdivision a of this section shall inform the commissioner, on a form prescribed by the commissioner, of: (i) all criminal convictions, in any jurisdiction, of such officer; (ii) any pending civil or criminal actions
    to which such officer is a party; and (iii) any criminal or civil investigation by a federal, state, or local prosecutorial agency, investigative agency or regulatory agency, in the five year period preceding the date of registration pursuant to subdivision
    a of this section and at any time subsequent to such registration, wherein such officer has (A) been the subject of such investigation, or (B) received a subpoena requiring the production of documents or information in connection with such an investigation.
    Any material change in information reported pursuant to this subdivision shall be reported to the commissioner within thirty calendar days thereof. The commissioner may, if he or she has reasonable cause to believe that such an officer lacks good
    character, honesty and integrity, require that such officer be fingerprinted by a person designated by the commissioner for such purpose or by the department of investigation and pay a fee to be submitted to the division of criminal justice services
    and/or the federal bureau of investigation for the purpose of obtaining criminal history records. c. The commissioner may, after notice and opportunity to be heard, disqualify an officer of a labor union or labor organization from holding office when
    such person: (i) has failed, by the date prescribed by the commissioner, to be fingerprinted or to provide truthful information in connection with the reporting requirements of subdivision b of this section; (ii) is the subject of a pending indictment
    or criminal action against such officer for a crime which bears a direct relationship to the lawful and orderly operation of the market, in which case the commissioner may defer a determination until a decision has been reached by the court before
    which such action is pending; (iii) has been convicted of a crime which, under the standards set forth in article 23-A of the correction law, bears a direct relationship to the lawful and orderly operation of the market, including the specific duties
    and responsibilities necessarily related to the union office; the bearing, if any the criminal offense or offenses will have on the fitness of the officer to perform such responsibilities; the time which has elapsed since the occurrence of the criminal
    offense or offenses; the seriousness of the offense or offenses; and any information produced by the person, or produced on his or her behalf, in regard to his or her rehabilitation or good conduct; (iv) has committed a racketeering activity or associated
    with a person who has been convicted of a racketeering activity, including but not limited to the offenses listed in subdivision one of section nineteen hundred sixty-one of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization statute (18 U.S.C. § 1961
    et seq.) or of an offense listed in subdivision one of section 460.10 of the penal law, as such statutes may be amended from time to time, when the officer knew or should have known of such conviction; or (v) has associated with any member or associate
    of an organized crime group as identified by a federal, state or city law enforcement or investigative agency when the officer knew or should have known of the organized crime associations of such person. An officer required to disclose information
    pursuant to subdivision a of this section may submit to the commissioner any material or explanation which such officer believes demonstrates that such information does not reflect adversely upon the officer's good character, honesty and integrity.
    If the commissioner determines pursuant to this subdivision that there are sufficient grounds to disqualify a person from holding office in a labor union or labor organization, the commissioner shall suspend such person from holding office pending
    final determination and, in the event such person is disqualified, such suspension shall continue pending resignation or vacatur of or removal from office. Upon written request of the suspended person within ten days of the commissioner's determination,
    the director of the office of collective bargaining shall prepare a list of the names of the first fifteen arbitrators selected at random from the roster of arbitrators approved by the office of collective bargaining and present the first five names
    on such list to the suspended person and the commissioner. Within alternating periods of five business days the suspended person and then the commissioner shall each strike a name from the list of selected arbitrators. If the parties cannot within
    two additional business days jointly appoint an arbitrator from those remaining on the list, the suspended person and then the commissioner shall within alternating periods of two business days each strike an additional name from the list. The remaining
    arbitrator shall thereupon be appointed as the arbitrator for that proceeding and shall establish a schedule for such proceeding. In the event that such arbitrator declines the appointment or for any reason is unable to accept the appointment, then
    the director of the office of collective bargaining shall within five business days present to the suspended person and the commissioner the next five names on the list of arbitrators previously selected at random and the procedures set forth in this
    subdivision for appointing an arbitrator shall be applied to this second group. In the event that the arbitrator appointed from this second group declines the appointment or for any reason is unable to accept the appointment then the director of the
    office of collective bargaining shall present the remaining five names from the list arbitrators selected at random and the suspended person shall select an arbitrator from such group. Such arbitrator shall make a final report and recommendations
    in writing concerning the disqualification. The commissioner shall accept such report and recommendations and issue his or her final determination consistent with such report and recommendations. In the event that the suspended person does not make
    a request for arbitration within the ten-day period he or she shall be disqualified from holding office. Upon receiving an order of the commissioner pursuant to this subdivision disqualifying a person from holding office in a labor union or labor
    organization, such person shall resign or vacate such office within fourteen days or, if such person fails to resign or vacate such office within such time period, such union or organization shall remove such person forthwith from such office. Failure
    of such a person to resign or vacate office within such time period shall subject such person to the penalties set forth in subdivision a of section 22-258 of this chapter. An officer who has been disqualified or suspended by the commissioner pursuant
    to the provisions of this subdivision may be excluded by the commissioner from the market. Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the commissioner to disqualify a labor union or labor organization from representing or seeking to represent
    employees of a business required to be registered pursuant to section 22-253 of this code. d. In reaching a determination to fingerprint or disqualify an officer of a labor union or labor organization pursuant to subdivisions b or c of this section,
    the commissioner shall give substantial weight to the results of any investigation conducted by an independent investigator, monitor, trustee or other person or body charged with the investigation or oversight of such labor union or labor organization,
    including whether such investigation has failed to return charges against such officer. e. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the contrary, the provisions of this section shall apply to any labor union or labor organization representing
    or seeking to represent employees of business required to be licensed or registered pursuant to chapter 1-A of this title in the fulton fish market distribution area or other seafood distribution area. The term "market" shall, for purposes of application
    of the provisions of this section to the fulton fish market distribution or other seafood distribution area, mean such areas.</text>
