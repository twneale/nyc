  <text>ยง 22-504.1 Equivalent experience; honorably discharged members of the armed forces of the United States. Whenever, by the provisions of the code, experience in a particular trade is a prerequisite for obtaining any license, certificate or permit issued
    thereunder, the period of service in the armed forces of the United States by an honorably discharged member thereof who shall apply for such license, certificate or permit, shall be deemed the equivalent of such experience on a year for year basis
    and shall be accepted accordingly, provided, however, that such applicant while in said armed forces performed duties equivalent to experience required for any such license, certificate or permit, and provided further that only the period of service
    during which such equivalent duties were performed shall be deemed equivalent experience. An applicant may apply the provisions of this section and section 22-504 of this chapter to satisfy the experience prerequisite in a particular trade for the
    applicable license, certificate or permit. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the head of each city agency issuing any license, certificate or permit for which experience in a particular trade is a prerequisite shall have the authority
    to determine whether additional experience is necessary before issuing any such license, certificate or permit. The provisions of this section shall apply only to applicants who are at least eighteen years of age; and are able to read and write the
    English language.</text>
