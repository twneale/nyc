  <text>ยง 22-218 Emergency suspension of license or registration and photo identification card. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter or rules promulgated pursuant thereto, the commissioner may, if he or she determines that the conduct of an unloading
    business, a loading business, a wholesale seafood business or a seafood delivery business, or the presence of any person in the market area creates an imminent danger to life or property, immediately suspend a license, registration or a photo identification
    card without a prior hearing, provided that provision shall be made for an immediate appeal of such suspension to a deputy commissioner of the department who shall determine such appeal forthwith. In the event that the deputy commissioner upholds
    the suspension, an opportunity for a hearing shall be provided on an expedited basis, within a period not to exceed four business days and the commissioner shall issue a final determination no later than four business days following the conclusion
    of such hearing; and provided further that the commissioner may, upon application by a business entity whose license or registration has been suspended, permit such business entity to remain in the market area for such time as is necessary to allow
    for the expeditious sale, consignment or removal of a perishable product if, in the commissioner's best judgment, such permission is consistent with the safety of the market area.</text>
