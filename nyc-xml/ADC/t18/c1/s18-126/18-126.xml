    on the official maps of the department as proposed sanitation land fill area V broadly described as follows: Area V, an irregular N-shaped area of marsh lands and lands under water running from a point where the sand of Orchard beach terminate in
    Long Island sound at the extreme northern tip of the beach, thence northwesterly to the eastern shore of Hunter island, thence northeast along the high water mark line of the eastern shore of Hunter island to that point of the island which still faces
    east into Long Island sound, thence in a wide arc going easterly and southerly, through the waters of Long Island sound, including within the arc the islands known as Cat Briars island or One Tree island, and Twin islands, back to the point of beginning.
    The commissioner may enter into an agreement with a nonprofit organization for the operation and maintenance by such organization of the areas hereinabove referred to for the adequate keeping, maintenance, management, operation and preservation by
    such organization of the animals, aquatic animals, migratory and resident fowl and songbirds, fish and other glacial or post glacial flora and fauna indigenous to the area, to establish collections of specimens and provide interested individual nature

    maintenance and support of the Hunter Island Marine Zoology and Geology Sanctuary and the activities of the operating organization in connection therewith. The failure of the commissioner to enter into such an agreement shall in no way alter the status
    of the above described areas as a marine zoology and geology sanctuary.</text>
