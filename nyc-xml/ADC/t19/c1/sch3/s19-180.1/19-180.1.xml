  <text>ยง 19-180.1 Safety audits of crash locations involving pedestrians a. Within one hundred and eighty days of receiving access to New York state department of motor vehicles traffic crash data involving pedestrian injuries or fatalities for the previous
    calendar year, the department shall: 1. Identify the twenty highest crash locations based upon a ranking of the total number of crashes involving pedestrians killed or seriously injured, occurring over a five-year period and selected proportionally
    by borough based upon the percentage of total crashes involving pedestrians in such borough; and 2. Inspect and conduct audits at such locations and, where warranted, make improvements or incorporate improvements into capital projects. b. Within thirty
    days of completing the inspections and audits required under paragraph 2 of subdivision a of this section, the department shall send a report noting such inspection and audit and summarizing its recommendations and steps to be taken, including a schedule
    to implement such recommendations, to the council member and community board in whose district the crash location is located. c. If any crash location appears on the department's annual list of twenty highest crash locations involving pedestrians
    more than once in five consecutive years, such location shall be removed from the annual list and replaced by the location with the next highest number of crashes involving pedestrians located within the same borough as the consecutively appearing
    location; provided that the department shall continue to monitor such crash data and/or make safety improvements at such removed location until such removed location is no longer one of the highest crash locations. d. For purposes of this section,
    "seriously injured" shall mean those injuries categorized as "A" injuries by the New York state department of motor vehicles.</text>
