  <text>ยง 19-189 Installation of speed humps on roadways adjacent to schools. a. Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following terms shall be defined as follows: 1. "School" shall mean any buildings, grounds, facilities, property, or portion
    thereof in which educational instruction is provided to at least 250 students at or below the twelfth grade level. 2. "Speed hump" shall mean any raised area in the roadway pavement surface extending transversely across the travel way that is composed
    of asphalt or another paving material and is installed and designed for the purpose of slowing vehicular traffic. b. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 19-183 and 19-185 of this chapter, the commissioner shall annually install one or more speed
    humps on not fewer than fifty block segments that are adjacent to a school. c. After evaluating every school in the city for the installation of speed humps pursuant to subdivisions b of this section, the commissioner may determine not to install
    any further speed humps and shall inform the speaker of the council in writing of such determination and the reasons therefor; provided, however, that the commissioner shall evaluate the need to install one or more speed humps on roadways adjacent
    to any school created after such determination. d. The commissioner may decline to install any speed hump that is otherwise required by this section if such installation would, in the commissioner's judgement, endanger the safety of motorists or pedestrians
    or not be consistent with the department's guidelines regarding the installation of speed humps.</text>
