  <text>ยง 19-139 Excavations for private purposes. Notice to public service corporations. The person by whom or for whose benefit any excavation is to be made in any street shall give notice thereof in writing, to any corporation whose pipes, mains or conduits
    are laid in the street about to be disturbed by such excavation, at least forty-eight hours before commencing the same; and shall, at his or her expense, sustain, secure and protect such pipes, mains or conduits from injury, and replace and pack the
    earth wherever the same shall have been removed, loosened or disturbed, under or around them, so that they shall be well and substantially supported. If any such person shall fail to sustain, secure and protect such pipes, mains or conduits from injury,
    or to replace and pack the earth under or around them, as the provisions of this section require, then the same may be done by the corporation to whom the same may belong, and the cost thereof, and all damages sustained by such corporation thereby
    shall be paid by such person, and, in default thereof, such corporation may maintain an action against him therefor.
