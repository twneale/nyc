  <text>ยง 19-144 Issuance of permit to open street within five years after completion of city capital construction project requiring resurfacing or reconstruction of such street. All persons having or proposing to install facilities in, on or over any street
    shall be responsible for reviewing the city's capital budget, capital plan and capital commitment plan. Such persons shall make provision to do any work, except emergency work, which requires the opening or use of any street prior to or during the
    construction of any capital project requiring resurfacing or reconstruction proposed in such budget or plan for such street. No permit to use or open any street, except for emergency work, shall be issued to any person within a five year period after
    the completion of the construction of a capital project set forth in such budget or plan relating to such street requiring resurfacing or reconstruction unless such person demonstrates that the need for the work could not have reasonably been anticipated
    prior to or during such construction. Notwithstanding the foregoing provision, the commissioner of transportation may issue a permit to open a street within such five year period upon a finding of necessity therefor, subject to such conditions as
    the commissioner may establish by rule, which shall include appropriate guarantees against the deterioration of the restored pavement.
