  <text>ยง 19-153 Inspection, testing and repair of electrical-related infrastructure. a. The provisions of this section shall only apply to electrical-related infrastructure located in the city of New York capable of emitting stray voltage. For purposes of
    this section, the following terms shall have the following meanings: 1. "Local electric corporation" shall mean an electric corporation as defined in paragraph 13 of section 2 of the public service law, or its successor provision, that owns and operates
    transmission and distribution systems for the provision of electrical service in the city of New York. 2. "Stray voltage" shall mean any unintended electrical potentials between contact points that may be encountered by humans or animals. 3. "Voltmeter"
    shall mean an instrument that measures differences of electric potential in volts. 4. "Non-conductive protective material" shall mean any casing or material of sufficient composition or thickness to adequately obstruct the unintended flow of electricity.
    b. All local electric corporations shall, where practicable and appropriate for the protection of public safety, utilize non-conductive protective materials to insulate their electrical-related infrastructure to prevent stray voltage. c. All local
    electric corporations shall establish and implement written guidelines and procedures for the annual inspection or testing of each category of its electrical-related infrastructure used to provide electrical service and for the repair of such infrastructure
    if required. Such guidelines and procedures shall include the annual inspection of each category of its electrical-related infrastructure located on, above or below any sidewalk used to provide electrical service and the repair of such infrastructure
    if required. Such guidelines and procedures shall also include the annual testing of each category of its electrical-related infrastructure in any location other than on, above or below a sidewalk used to provide electrical service and the repair
    of such infrastructure if required. Each inspection and testing period shall be comprised of an uninterrupted twelve month period concluding on November 30 of each year. Such local electric corporations shall establish such inspection and testing
    schedules and procedures for at least the following categories of electrical-related infrastructure: transformers, switching and protective devices, regulators and capacitors, overhead and underground cables, wires and conductors, above and below
    ground utility and connection boxes, manhole covers, metal plates, gratings and poles. d. Each piece of electrical-related infrastructure included in the list of categories of such infrastructure set forth in subdivision c of this section that has
    been found to emit stray voltage shall be repaired or made safe within twenty-four hours of discovery or knowledge of such condition by the local electric corporation that owns and operates the infrastructure, or a contractor or subcontractor thereof,
    in a manner that completely eliminates the emission of any such stray voltage. e. Upon completion of the annual inspection, testing and repair program mandated by subdivision c of this section, all local electric corporations shall provide the council,
    the department and the public service commission with a written report no later than January 15 of each year. Such report shall state that each piece of its electrical-related infrastructure has been inspected where required, tested where required,
    and, if necessary, repaired during the immediately preceding inspection and testing period. Such report shall indicate each location at which stray voltage was found and shall state that in each such instance, each repair was completed in accordance
    with accepted professional standards and that no public safety hazard exists. Such report shall include a detailed account of all types of non-conductive protective materials utilized to insulate such local electric corporation's electrical-related
    infrastructure during the period being reported upon, as well as any planned changes in the types of non-conductive protective materials to be employed during the next reporting period to meet the mandate set forth in subdivision b of this section
    with an explanation for any proposed change. Such report shall also include a complete list of all inspections, tests and repairs for the detection and elimination of stray voltage conducted outside the course of the inspection and testing schedules
    required by subdivision c of this section, such as those initiated in response to consumer complaints, including the nature and location of the condition complained of, whether the complaint was founded, what repair work was undertaken and to what
    category of electrical-related infrastructure and the amount of time taken from receipt of the complaint to completely eliminate any stray voltage. f. The department shall conduct random tests, by utilizing a voltmeter, of the electrical-related infrastructure
    of any local electric corporation for the purposes of detecting stray voltage and shall maintain written reports of the results of each such test. Commencing with the twelve month inspection and testing period beginning on December 1, 2004, the department
    shall conduct at least two hundred fifty such tests at random sites during each twelve month inspection and testing period. The reports created pursuant to this testing shall be forwarded to the public service commission and to the local electric
    corporation whose sites the department tests. g. All local electric corporations shall establish and implement an educational campaign aimed at informing the public of how to identify and protect themselves from the dangers of stray voltage potentially
    emanating from their electrical-related infrastructure. The campaign shall utilize the information from the annual report of inspections, tests and repairs required by this section to alert the public to the locations most frequently documented as
    having had stray voltage.</text>
