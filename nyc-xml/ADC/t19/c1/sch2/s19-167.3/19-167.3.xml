    other parking space within one hundred feet of such muni-meter, until one hour prior to the next time meter rules take effect for any parking space within the block or parking field, or for any other parking space within one hundred feet of such muni-meter;
    and 2. when such muni-meter does not contain paper to print timed receipts. c. This section shall apply only to muni-meters that can be programmed as set forth in subdivision b of this section, provided that no later than two years after the enactment
