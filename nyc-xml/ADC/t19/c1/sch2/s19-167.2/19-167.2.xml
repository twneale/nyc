  <text>ยง 19-167.2 Transfer of muni-meter time. a. For the purposes of this section, the term "muni-meter" shall mean an electronic parking meter that dispenses timed receipts that must be displayed in a conspicuous place on a vehicle's dashboard. b. Parking
    time that is purchased at a muni-meter shall be valid for use during such time at any parking space where parking meter rules are in effect, provided that: 1. the parking meter rate at such parking space is the same as or less than the rate at the
    location where such parking time was purchased; 2. the vehicle is not parked at such parking space in excess of the maximum amount of time parking is authorized at such parking space as indicated on posted signs. For purposes of this paragraph, the
    length of time a vehicle is parked at a parking space shall be calculated from the time such parking time was purchased, as indicated on the muni-meter receipt; and 3. the vehicle is not otherwise parked in violation of any law or rule.
