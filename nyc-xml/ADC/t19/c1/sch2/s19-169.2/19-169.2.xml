    owner, lessee, managing agent or other person in control of the property on which such motor vehicle is parked. Such contract shall also provide that such owner, lessee, managing agent or other person in control of the property shall be liable for
    any violation by such licensee or his or her employees or agents of any of the provisions of this section or of subchapter thirty-two of chapter two of title twenty of this code or of any rules promulgated pursuant to this section or such subchapter.
