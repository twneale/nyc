  <text>ยง 19-514 Color schemes and emblems. a. The exterior of all taxicabs shall be painted yellow or any shade thereof. b. The name of the corporate owner shall be printed on both rear doors or on both front doors of each taxicab in such a manner as shall
    be prescribed by the commission. c. The commission may grant to any taxicab owner or association of taxicab owners, upon proper application therefor, the exclusive right to use one or more distinctive emblems or other identifying designs to be displayed
    on the vehicles of such applicant. d. Such applications must include colored sketches of the proposed color schemes of the emblems or designs, together with such other and further information as the commission may require. e. An owner shall not use
    an emblem granted to another owner or association, an emblem so similar as to lead to confusion in the mind of the public, or an emblem granted to any association unless he or she be a member of said association. The commission may suspend the license
    of any owner violating the provisions hereof. f. Each taxicab license shall be represented by a metal medallion which shall bear the license number and be affixed to the outside of the licensed taxicab. The commission may require that a notice be
    posted at the main entrance of each garage housing taxicab vehicles reciting the number of such vehicles, their license numbers and such other information as the commission may designate. g. Any vehicle for hire except those licensed under the provisions
    of this chapter shall not bear the colors yellow, orange, or gold, or, in combination of yellow-white, orange-white, gold-white, green-white, blue-white or any other combination of the above said colors or color scheme or striping in said colors.
    h. Any accessible taxicab or for-hire vehicle licensed by the commission shall display the international wheelchair insignia or other insignia approved by the commission that identifies such vehicle as an accessible vehicle, in a minimum of two prominent
    locations on such vehicle's exterior. For purposes of this subdivision, "accessible vehicle" shall mean any vehicle approved for use by the commission as a taxicab or for-hire vehicle that meets the specifications and requirements for accessible vehicles
    pursuant to the americans with disabilities act of 1990, as amended, and rules promulgated by the commission. i. Any clean air vehicle licensed by the commission shall display the words "CLEAN AIR VEHICLE" or such other term or symbol approved by
    the commission that identifies such vehicle as a clean air vehicle in a minimum of two prominent locations on such vehicle's exterior. For the purposes of this subdivision, "clean air vehicle" shall mean any taxicab or for-hire vehicle approved for
    use by the commission that receives an air pollution score of 9.0 or higher from the United States environmental protection agency or its successor agency and is estimated to emit 6.4 tons or less of equivalent carbon dioxide per year by the United
    States department of energy or its successor agency; provided that such vehicle is powered by the fuel for which such vehicle meets the above-specified standards. In the event the test method used by the United States environmental protection agency
    or its successor agency for determining fuel economy is adjusted in a way that impacts United States department of energy or its successor agency estimates of equivalent carbon dioxide emissions for motor vehicles, the commission shall, for vehicles
    that fall within the affected model years, modify by rule the equivalent carbon dioxide emissions estimate included herein so as to appropriately reflect such adjustment's impact consistent with the intent of this section.</text>
