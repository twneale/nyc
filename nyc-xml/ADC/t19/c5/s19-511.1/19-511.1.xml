  <text>ยง 19-511.1 Council review. Any determination by the commission to approve an application for a license to operate a new base station or to renew a license to operate a base station shall be subject to review by the council. Within ninety days of the
    first stated meeting following receipt of such determination and its accompanying materials, the council may approve or disapprove such determination by local law, after having adopted a resolution to review that determination. In the event that the
    council fails to act by local law within the ninety day period provided for in this section, the determination of the commission shall remain in effect. Where a base station license would otherwise expire while a determination by the commission to
    approve a renewal of such license is pending before the council, such license shall remain in full force and effect, unless suspended or revoked by the commission, until either the council has passed a local law to disapprove such determination or
    the period within which the council may act has elapsed.
