    within a twelve month period; (2) Where each commuter van comprising a number of commuter vans equaling at least thirty percent of the total number of commuter vans operating as part of the same current, valid authorization, rounded up to the next
    whole number, has operated without complying with any safety inspection requirements arising from any applicable law, rule or regulation at least three times within a twelve month period; (3) Where a commuter van driver has had his or her license
    revoked pursuant to subdivision p of section 19-505 of this chapter while operating as part of such authorization and thereafter is found to be operating a commuter van as part of such authorization without a commuter van driver's license required
    pursuant to section 19-505 of this chapter three times within a six month period; or (4) Where the number of violations of paragraph five of subdivision a of section 19-504.3 of this chapter occurring within a twelve month period is equal to the following:
    ninety percent of the number of commuter vans authorized to operate as part of such authorization, rounded up to the next whole number, or five, whichever is greater. b. Any commuter van license shall be revoked after the holder of such license has
    had an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with procedures to be established by the commission and after which the holder of such license is found guilty of any of the following: (1) Failure to maintain the required liability insurance three times
    within a period of one year; or (2) Operating without complying with any safety inspection requirements arising from any applicable law, rule or regulation three times within a period of one year. c. The commission may refuse to renew any authorization
    to operate a commuter van service or any commuter van license or commuter van driver's license required by this chapter and, after due notice and an opportunity to be heard, may suspend or revoke any such authorization or license upon the occurrence
    of any one or more of the following conditions: (1) the holder of an authorization or a license or any of its officers, principals, directors, employees, or stockholders owning more than ten percent of the outstanding stock of the corporation has
    been found by the commission to have violated any of the provisions of this chapter or any rule promulgated thereunder governing the operation of commuter van services, commuter vans and commuter van drivers; or (2) the holder of an authorization
    or a license or any of its officers, principals, directors, employees, or stockholders owning more than ten percent of the outstanding stock of the corporation has made a material false statement or concealed a material fact in connection with the
    filing of any application or certification pursuant to this chapter or has engaged in any fraud or misrepresentation in connection with rendering transportation service; or (3) the holder of an authorization or a license or any of its officers, principals,
    directors, or stockholders owning more than ten percent of the outstanding stock of the corporation has not paid any penalty duly imposed pursuant to the provisions of this chapter or any rule promulgated hereunder; or (4) the holder of an authorization
    or a license or any of its officers, principals, directors, or stockholders owning more than ten percent of the outstanding stock of the corporation has been convicted of a crime which, in the judgment of the commission, has a direct relationship
    to such person's fitness or ability to perform any of the activities for which an authorization or a license is required under this chapter, or has been convicted of any other offense which under the provisions of article twenty-three-a of the correction
    law, would provide a basis for the commission to refuse to renew, or to suspend or revoke, such authorization or license; or (5) the holder of an authorization or a license has failed to maintain the conditions of operation applicable to the particular
    authorization or license as provided in this chapter; or (6) the holder of an authorization or a license or any of its officers, principals, directors, employees, or stockholders owning more than ten percent of the outstanding stock of the corporation
    has been found to have violated any of the provisions of section 8-107 of the code concerning unlawful discriminatory practices in public accommodations in the operation of a commuter van service or a commuter van. d. Notwithstanding the foregoing
    provisions, the chairperson of the commission may immediately suspend any authorization to operate a commuter van service or commuter van license or commuter van driver's license issued under this chapter without a prior hearing where the chairperson
    determines that the continued possession of such authorization or license poses a serious danger to the public health, safety or welfare, provided that after such suspension an opportunity for a hearing shall be provided on an expedited basis, within
    a period not to exceed fourteen days. e. Where the commission suspends or revokes an authorization to operate a commuter van service pursuant to this section: (1) any commuter van license which has been issued as part of such authorization shall be
    deemed suspended or revoked, as the case may be, where the suspension or revocation of the authorization to operate a commuter van service was based, in whole or in part, upon the operation of such commuter van; or (2) any commuter van license which
    has been issued as part of such authorization shall continue to be valid in accordance with its terms where the suspension or revocation of the authorization to operate a commuter van service was not based, in whole or in part, upon the operation
    of such commuter van; provided, however, that such commuter van shall not be operated in the course of operations of such commuter van service unless and until such commuter van operates as part of a current, valid authorization to operate a commuter
    van service; provided, further that any such commuter van which operates without being part of a current, valid authorization to operate a commuter van service shall be deemed to be operating without a commuter van license and shall be subject to
    any and all of the penalties that may be imposed under this chapter for the unlicensed operation of commuter vans, including seizure and forfeiture as provided in sections 19-529.2 and 19-529.3 of this chapter. f. Notwithstanding any other provision
    of law, any person who has had an authorization to operate a commuter van service revoked by the commission pursuant to this section shall not be permitted to apply for an authorization to operate a commuter van service under this chapter for a period
    of six months after the date of such revocation. g. The commission shall notify the holder of an authorization to operate a commuter van service of all violations issued to any driver or vehicle operating pursuant to such authorization.</text>
