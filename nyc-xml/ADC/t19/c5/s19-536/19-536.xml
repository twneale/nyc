  <text>ยง 19-536 Clean air vehicle labeling and information. a. For the purposes of this section, the term "clean air vehicle" shall mean any taxicab approved for use by the commission that receives an air pollution score of 9.0 or higher from the United States
    environmental protection agency or its successor agency and is estimated to emit 6.4 tons or less of equivalent carbon dioxide per year by the United States department of energy or its successor agency; provided that such vehicle is powered by the
    fuel for which such vehicle meets the above-specified standards. In the event the test method used by the United States environmental protection agency or its successor agency for determining fuel economy is adjusted in a way that impacts United States
    department of energy or its successor agency estimates of equivalent carbon dioxide emissions for motor vehicles, the commission shall, for vehicles that fall within the affected model years, modify by rule the equivalent carbon dioxide emissions
    estimate included herein so as to appropriately reflect such adjustment's impact consistent with the intent of this section. b. The commission shall develop and provide information to each owner of a clean air vehicle, which shall be made available
    for viewing in each such vehicle in a manner that is clearly apparent to a passenger located in the back seat of such vehicle, and which (i) identifies such vehicle as a clean air vehicle; (ii) includes the address of the commission web page(s) required
    to be established pursuant to section 19-534 of this chapter; and (iii) includes, to the extent practicable, the estimated air quality benefits associated with the use of such vehicle and the type of fuel used to power such vehicle.</text>
