  <text>ยง 19-522 Group riding. The commission shall institute a group riding plan for the taxi industry in the city of New York. Initially, this plan shall encompass, minimally, a pilot group riding program from John F. Kennedy international airport to any
    and all points in the five boroughs, providing dispatchers at the various airport terminals and a central dispatching system to expedite passenger conveyance. After sixty days from the start of such program at John F. Kennedy international airport,
    the commission shall seek to establish group riding programs at various points in the five boroughs, to be designated by the commission, with the view to increasing taxicab availability to and from the outlying sections of the city to meet the maximum
