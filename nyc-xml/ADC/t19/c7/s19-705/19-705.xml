  <text>ยง 19-705 Accessible route. Except as may otherwise be set forth herein, there shall be at least one accessible route (i) to, (ii) into, (iii) onto and (iv) throughout any water borne commuter services facility consisting of a continuous, firm, stable
    and slip-resistant path that is maintained free of ice and snow; provided, however, that except as may be required pursuant to federal or state law, rule or regulation, no water borne commuter services facility shall be required to modify or install
    an elevator in order to satisfy the requirements of this chapter. No accessible route may have any vertical steps or rises greater than 1/2 inch unless made accessible by ramps, gangways or transition plates complying with this section. No accessible
    route may require that use thereof or accessibility thereto be conditioned upon prearrangement except to the extent a ticket must be purchased or fare must be paid. An accessible route shall provide or satisfy the following additional criteria, as
    applicable: a. Points of embarkation and disembarkation. Each point of embarkation and disembarkation shall provide or satisfy each of the following criteria: 1. A minimum clear width of 36 inches, exclusive of any bulwarks, lifelines, deck rails
    and toe rails; provided, however, that where the main deck area of a water borne commuter vessel is less than 3,000 square feet, such clear width shall be at least 32 inches, exclusive of any bulwarks, lifelines, deck rails and toe rails. 2. Doors
    and doorways with a minimum width of 32 inches; provided, however, that any projections into such clear opening shall be mounted at least 34 inches above the finished deck surface; and provided, further, that any projections situated 34 inches or

    vessels and the inner cabins of such vessels that have steps or coamings leading into such cabins; provided, however, that such transition plates and ramps may be removable. With respect to water borne commuter vessels designed or constructed after
    the date of enactment of the local law that added this chapter, removable coamings shall be utilized where feasible and permitted by the United States Coast Guard, pursuant to title 14 of the United States code or any rules or regulations promulgated
    pursuant thereto. 4. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, wherever there are multiple points of embarkation or disembarkation, and two or more such points are simultaneously utilized at any given docking, only one such point
    need comply with the provisions of this section. b. Gangways. Gangways shall provide or satisfy each of the following criteria: 1. Handrails on each side. 2. A minimum clear width of 36 inches, which width shall be measured between the inside edges
    of handrails. 3. A maximum running slope of 1:12 and a maximum cross slope of 1:48, subject to reasonable and minor variations under extreme and unusual tidal conditions. 4. Edge protection on each side. 5. A design that ensures that no water will
    accumulate on walking surfaces. 6. A rise which may exceed 30 inches. 7. A length which may exceed 30 feet between level landings; provided, however, that such slope may not exceed 1:12 subject to reasonable and minor variations under extreme and
    unusual tidal conditions. c. Transition plates. Transition plates shall provide or satisfy each of the following criteria: 1. A maximum slope of 1:12. 2. A minimum clear width of 36 inches. 3. Handrails on each side, where the length of a transition
    plate exceeds 24 inches. 4. The transition from the deck to the transition plate may be vertical without edge treatment up to 1/4 inch. Changes in level between 1/4 inch and 1/2 inch shall be beveled with a slope no greater than 1:2. 5. Transition
    plates that are 36 inches or less in length shall support a minimum load of 300 lbs. Transition plates that are greater than 36 inches in length shall support a minimum load of 100 lbs. per square foot. d. On board maneuvering space and clear paths.
    On board maneuvering space and clear paths shall provide or satisfy each of the following criteria: 1. An on board maneuvering space shall be provided adjacent to the accessible opening in the bulwarks, lifelines, deck rails or toe rails which is
    either (i) 60 inches minimum by 60 inches minimum or (ii) 42 inches minimum in depth and starting at one side of the opening and extending 80 inches minimum in width across the opening (see figure 1, L-Shaped Space, as set forth in this subdivision).
    2. At least one clear path of at least 32 inches in width shall run from each point of embarkation and disembarkation to all facilities available to the general public on the level of such water borne commuter services vessel where such point of embarkation
    or disembarkation is located. ______________________________________________________________ 1 | 2 | 3 COPY OF FIGURE 1 | 4 MAY BE OBTAINED FROM: | 5 NYS LEGISLATIVE BILL DRAFTING COMMISSION | 6 CONTACT: LEGISLATIVE RETRIEVAL SYSTEM'S HELPLINE | 7

    1. Measure at least 30 inches by at least 48 inches for placement of wheelchairs, exclusive of legroom for other passengers. Such clear spaces may also be provided in the form of readily folding or removable seats. 2. A tie down system that complies
    with subdivision (f) of this section. 3. The number of clear deck spaces shall be provided in accordance with Table 1 of this subdivision and shall be dispersed throughout the water borne commuter vessel's passenger areas; provided, however, that
    at least one such space shall be provided on any outdoor passenger area on water borne commuter vessels with a passenger capacity of 101 or more. Table 1. Clear Deck Spaces Passenger capacity of water borne commuter vessel Minimum Number 0 to 100
    2 101 to 149 4 150 and above 6 4. This subdivision does not apply to spaces reachable only by vertical or inclined ladder. f. Tie-down systems. Tie-down systems for securing wheelchairs within water borne commuter vessels shall provide or satisfy
    each of the following criteria: 1. Each tie-down system shall consist of any tie-down system acceptable for taxi, van or bus transportation as provided under the United States department of transportation regulations or four d-rings securely fastened
    to the deck. 2. Where d-rings are used, lashings, also known as marine-strength quality rope, shall be provided to secure a wheelchair to the d-rings. 3. Security belts for securing disabled persons in their wheelchairs for use by disabled persons
    at their discretion. g. Toilet rooms. Where one or more toilet rooms are provided on a water borne commuter vessel at least one such toilet room shall provide or satisfy each of the following criteria: 1. An entry door with a clear width of at least

    to the top of the toilet seat. 5. Clear deck space of at least 30 inches by at least 48 inches adjacent to the toilet. 6. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any water borne commuter vessel with a passenger capacity of 1000
    or more persons currently scheduled to be decommissioned before November 1, 2005 shall be exempt from the requirements of this subdivision. h. Vessel loading equipment. Vessel loading equipment shall provide or satisfy each of the following criteria:
    1. A maximum slope of 1:12 where feasible; provided, however, that where achieving such a maximum slope is not feasible, any vessel loading equipment exceeding such slope shall comply with the following additional criteria: (i) A slope no greater
    than 1:10. (ii) Must be designed and operated such that disabled persons are able to embark onto and disembark from a water borne commuter vessel without water borne commuter services facilities personnel pushing, carrying, pulling, lifting or otherwise
    physically handling disabled persons. 2. Deck surfaces that do not have protrusions from the surface greater than 1/4 inch. 3. No opening along the bottom surface shall permit passage of a 1/2 inch diameter sphere. Elongated openings shall be placed
