  <text>ยง 17-150 Suits for expenses. The department, in case it has incurred any expense, or has rendered service for which payment is due, and as the rules of the department may provide, may institute and maintain a suit against any one liable for such expenses,
    or against any person, firm, or corporation, owing or who may owe such rent or compensation, and may recover the expenses so incurred under any such order. One or more of such parties liable or interested may be made parties to such action as the
    department may elect; but the parties made responsible herein for such expenses shall be liable to contribute or to make payment as between themselves, in respect of such expenses, and of any sum recovered for such expenses or compensation, or by
    any party paid on account thereof, according to the legal or equitable obligation existing between them.</text>
