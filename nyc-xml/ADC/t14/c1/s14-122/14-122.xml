  <text>§ 14-122 Relief from active duty due to disability. The commissioner shall have power to relieve from active duty on patrol any member of the police force, who, while in the actual performance of duty and without fault or misconduct on his or her part,
    shall have become disabled, physically, as a result of injuries or illness attributable thereto, so as to be unfit to perform full police duty, such disability having been certified to by so many of the police surgeons as the commissioner may require.
    Such member may be assigned to the performance of such light duties as he or she may be qualified to perform.</text>
