  <text>§ 11-703 Presumptions and burden of proof. a. For the purpose of the proper administration of this chapter and to prevent evasion of the tax hereby imposed it shall be presumed that all premises are taxable premises and that all rent paid or required
    to be paid by a tenant is base rent until the contrary is established, and the burden of proving that such presumptive base rent or any portion thereof is not included in the measure of the tax imposed by this chapter shall be on the tenant. b. Where
    a tenant uses premises both for residential purposes and as taxable premises and the tenant pays an undivided rent for the premises so used, it shall be conclusively presumed against such tenant that the rent ascribable to so much of such premises
    as is used as taxable premises shall be the amount which such tenant deducts as rent for such premises in determining the tenant's federal income tax (as reduced by any disallowance of such deduction which is not being contested) which is fairly attributable
    to the tax period or tax year.</text>
