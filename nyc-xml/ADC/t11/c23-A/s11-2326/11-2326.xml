  <text>§ 11-2326 Liability for surcharge. (a) Each service supplier customer who is subject to the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to the city for the surcharge until it has been paid to the city, except that payment to a service supplier is sufficient
    to relieve the customer from further liability for such surcharge. (b) The service supplier shall have no obligation to take any legal action to enforce the collection of any surcharge. However, whenever the service supplier remits the funds collected
    as the surcharge to the city, it shall also provide the city with the name and address of any customer refusing or failing to pay the surcharge imposed by this chapter and shall state the amount of such surcharge remaining unpaid.</text>
