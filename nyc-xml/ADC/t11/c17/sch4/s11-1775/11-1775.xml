  <text>§ 11-1775 Employer's liability for withheld taxes. Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax under this chapter is hereby made liable for such tax. For purposes of assessment and collection, any amount required to be withheld and paid over
    to the tax commission, and any additions to tax, penalties and interest with respect thereto, shall be considered the tax of the employer. Any amount of tax actually deducted and withheld under this chapter shall be held to be a special fund in trust
    for the tax commission. No employee shall have any right of action against his or her employer in respect to any moneys deducted and withheld from his or her wages and paid over to the tax commission in compliance or in intended compliance with this
    chapter.</text>
