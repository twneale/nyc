    of an annual vault charge or determination on any application for refund by the commissioner of finance, nor any decision by the tax appeals tribunal or any of its administrative law judges, shall be enjoined or reviewed by an action for declaratory
    judgment, an action for money had and received or by any action or proceeding other than, in the case of a decision by the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc, a proceeding in the nature of a certiorari proceeding under article seventy-eight of the
    civil practice law and rules; provided, however, that a person liable for the annual vault charge may proceed by declaratory judgment if he or she institutes suit within thirty days after a deficiency assessment is made and pays the amount of the
    deficiency assessment to the commissioner of finance prior to the institution of such suit and posts a bond for costs as provided in section 11-2707 of this chapter.</text>
