  <text>ยง 11-302.1 Error in record of payment of tax or assessment. (a) If the records of the department of finance show a charge as paid due to a misapplied payment or other error, and the department later corrects the records, interest shall not be imposed
    until after the department (i) corrects the error and (ii) sends a statement of account or other similar bill or notice stating the amount due and when the charge must be paid to avoid the accrual of interest. (b) The provisions of this section shall
    not apply to an installment of tax or an assessment for which payment, made electronically, by check, or by other means, was dishonored. (c) The provisions of this section shall not apply where the error in the records of the department was made as
