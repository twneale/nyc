  <text>ยง 26-813 Judicial Review. Any person aggrieved by an appraisal determination made pursuant to section 26-804 of this chapter, or by the failure of the department to approve a bona fide offer to purchase, may, within thirty days of the appraisal determination
    or action by the department, seek judicial review pursuant to article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules in the supreme court for the county in which the assisted rental housing is located. In the event that a court may find that the
    appraisal or action by the department constitutes the equivalent of a taking without just compensation, the court shall require that a new appraisal or determination be made. The time periods set forth in this chapter shall be tolled during the pendency
    of such a proceeding and until a new appraisal or determination, if needed, is made.
