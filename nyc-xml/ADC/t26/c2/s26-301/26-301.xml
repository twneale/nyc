    bridge and tunnel authority; and (iii) for tenants of real property located in any neighborhood improvement district designated by the city planning commission, where the displacement of such tenants results from the enforcement of any law, regulation,
    order or requirement pertaining to the maintenance and operation of such property or the health, safety and welfare of its occupants; and (iv) when authorized by the mayor, for the tenants of any privately owned building or other improvement which
    is to be voluntarily rehabilitated in accordance with an urban renewal plan pursuant to law; and (v) for tenants of any privately owned building where the displacement of such tenants results from the enforcement of any law, regulation, order or requirement
    pertaining to the maintanance or operation of such building or the health, safety and welfare of its occupants. Such services shall consist of such activities as he or she may deem necessary, useful or appropriate for the relocation of such tenants,
    including but not limited to the gathering and furnishing of information as to suitable vacant accommodations, the making of studies and surveys for the purpose of locating such accommodations and the provision of facilities for the registration of
    such accommodations with the department by owners, lessors and managing agents of real property and others. (b) Subject to the approval of the mayor, to fix and promulgate and from time to time amend a schedule of payments to be made to or for the
    benefit of and to aid in the relocation of tenants. Such schedule with respect to payments resulting from or relative to state or state-aided programs or activities within the city of New York shall also be subject to the approval of the director

    for the services of finding accommodations to which such tenants are to be relocated. Such schedule may include maximum or minimum payments, or both. The acceptance of a payment provided for under such schedule by a landlord, owner or authorized agent
    shall not be deemed a violation of any rent regulation or statutory prohibition to the contrary. (c) Subject to the approval of the mayor, to adopt and promulgate and from time to time amend supplementary rules and regulations not inconsistent with
    the provisions of this section in regard to relocation practices and procedures, applicable as herein provided. (d) To schedule and coordinate the tenant relocation operations of agencies, persons, firms and corporations to which the rules and regulations

    forth a finding that any such dwelling is in condition which endangers the life, health or safety of the occupants, and if he or she accepts such report, the commissioner may certify that the conditions in the dwelling are such that they require that
    the dwelling be vacated in which event he or she shall: (i) order such dwelling to be vacated by its occupants upon no less than thirty days written notice to such occupants; and (ii) provide relocation services and allowances for occupants who relocate
    pursuant to any such order and the regulations promulgated by the department. 2. The commissioner shall have power, when authorized by the mayor, to let contracts for the furnishing of maintenance services, payments and benefits deemed necessary,

    the benefit of such tenants shall be those fixed and promulgated pursuant to paragraph (b) of subdivision one of this section. 3. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, the schedule promulgated pursuant to paragraph (b) of subdivision one of
    this section and the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to paragraph (c) of subdivision one of this section shall, to the extent to which they are not inconsistent with any federal act or regulation issued pursuant thereto, be applicable to

    of the department pursuant to section 26-302 of this chapter provided, however, that where the commissioner furnishes relocation services to any tenants pursuant to the provisions of subparagraph (iv) of paragraph (a) of subdivision one of this section,
    such schedule shall be applicable to the person, firm or corporation which has contracted with the city for the rehabilitation of the building or other improvement occupied by such tenants, and such person, firm or corporation shall make payments
    to or for the benefit of such tenants in accordance with such schedule, subject to adjustment as to payments with respect to which federal reimbursement is provided. 4. The commissioner shall have the power to investigate, examine and inspect relocation
    operations which are subject to the provisions of this section. 5. The commissioner shall annually submit to the mayor, the board of estimate, and the council a detailed report on tenant relocation activities which are subject to the provisions of
