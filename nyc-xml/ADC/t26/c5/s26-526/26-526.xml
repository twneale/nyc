  <text>§ 26-526 Notice of pendency. a. In any action or proceeding instituted under this chapter, the corporation counsel may file in the county clerk's office of the county where the dwelling affected by such action or proceeding is situated, a notice of
    the pendency of such action or proceeding. Such notice may be filed at the time of the commencement of the action or proceeding, or at any time afterwards, before final judgment or order. The corporation counsel shall designate in writing the name
    of each person against whom the notice is filed and the number of each block on the land map of the county which is affected by the notice. The county clerk in whose office the notice of pendency is filed shall record and index such notice against
    the names and blocks designated. b. Any such notice may be vacated upon the order of a judge of the court in which such action or proceeding was instituted or is pending, or upon the consent in writing of the corporation counsel. The clerk of the
    county where such notice is filed shall cancel such notice upon receipt of such consent or of a certified copy of such order.</text>
