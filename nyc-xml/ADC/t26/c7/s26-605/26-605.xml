  <text>ยง 26-605 Rent increase exemption orders/tax abatement certificates. (a) Subject to the provisions of this chapter an eligible head of the household may obtain a rent increase exemption order/tax abatement certificate entitling him or her to an exemption
    from increases in the maximum rent otherwise payable in one of the following amounts: (1) where the eligible head of the household does not receive a monthly allowance for shelter pursuant to the social services law, the amount by which increases
    in the maximum rent subsequent to such persons' eligibility date have resulted in the maximum rent exceeding one-third of the combined income of all members of the household for the taxable period, except that in no event shall a rent increase exemption
    order tax abatement certificate become effective prior to January first, nineteen hundred seventy-six; or (2) where the eligible head of the household receives a monthly allowance for shelter pursuant to the social services law, an amount not exceeding
    that portion of any increase in maximum rent subsequent to such person's eligibility date which is not covered by the maximum allowance for shelter which such person is entitled to receive pursuant to the social services law. (b) Notwithstanding any
    other provision of law, when a head of a household to whom the then current, valid tax abatement certificate has been issued under this chapter, chapter three or chapter four of this title moves his principal residence to a subsequent dwelling unit
    subject to this chapter, or which is or was subject to a mortgage insured or initially insured by the federal government pursuant to section two hundred thirteen of the national housing act, as amended, the head of the household may apply to the supervising
    agency, subject to the terms and conditions imposed by this chapter, for a tax abatement certificate relating to the subsequent dwelling unit, and such certificate may provide that the head of the household shall be exempt from paying that portion
    of the maximum rent for the subsequent dwelling unit which is the least of the following: (1) the amount by which the rent for the subsequent dwelling unit exceeds the last rent, as reduced, which the head of the household was required to actually
    pay in the original dwelling unit; (2) the last amount deducted from the maximum rent or legal regulated rent meaning the most recent monthly deduction for the applicant in the original dwelling unit pursuant to this section, section 26-406 or section
    26-409 of this title; or (3) where the eligible head of the household does not receive a monthly allowance pursuant to the social services law, the amount by which the maximum rent or legal regulated rent of the subsequent dwelling unit exceeds one-third
    of the combined income of all members of the household. Such certificate shall be effective as of the first day of the month in which the tenant applied for such exemption or as of the date the tenant took occupancy of the subsequent dwelling unit,
    whichever is later, provided both occur after the effective date of this law. (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law and to the extent applicable to the provisions of this chapter, any renewal application being made by the tenant pursuant
    to this section, any rent increase order then in effect with respect to such tenant shall be deemed renewed until such time as the department of housing preservation and development shall have found such tenant to be either eligible or ineligible
    for a rent increase exemption order but in no event for more than six additional months. If such tenant is found eligible, the order shall be deemed to have taken effect upon expiration of the exemption. In the event that any such tenant shall, subsequent
    to any such automatic renewal, not be granted a rent increase exemption order, such tenant shall be liable to his or her landlord for the difference between the amounts he or she has paid under the provisions of the automatically renewed order and
    the amounts which he or she would have been required to pay in the absence of such order. Any rent increase exemption order issued pursuant to this chapter shall include provisions giving notice as to the contents of this section relating to automatic
    renewals of rent exemption orders. (d) notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, where an eligible head of the household holds a current, valid rent increase exemption order/tax abatement certificate and, after the effective date
    of this subdivision, there is a permanent decrease in income in an amount which exceeds twenty percent of such income as represented in such eligible head of household's last approved application for a rent increase exemption order/tax abatement certificate
    or for renewal thereof, such eligible head of the household may apply for a redetermination of the amount set forth therein. Upon application, such amount shall be redetermined so as to reestablish the ratio of adjusted rent to income which existed
    at the time of approval of such eligible head of the household's last application for a rent increase exemption order/tax abatement certificate or for renewal thereof; provided, however, that in no event shall the amount of the adjusted rent be redetermined
    to be (i) in the case of an eligible head of the household who does not receive a monthly allowance for shelter pursuant to the social services law, less than one-third of income; or (ii) in the case of an eligible head of the household who receives
    a monthly allowance for shelter pursuant to the social services law, less than the maximum allowance for shelter which such eligible head of the household is entitled to receive pursuant to law. For purposes of this subdivision, a decrease in income
    shall not include any decrease in income resulting from the manner in which income is calculated pursuant to any amendment to paragraph f of subdivision one of section four hundred sixty-seven-c of the real property tax law or an amendment to subdivision
    f of section 26-601 of this code made on or after April first, nineteen hundred eighty-seven. For purposes of this subdivision, "adjusted rent" shall mean maximum rent less the amount set forth in a rent increase exemption order/tax abatement certificate.</text>
