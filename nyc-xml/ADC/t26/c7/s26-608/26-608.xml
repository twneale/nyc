  <text>ยง 26-608 Credit allowances; penalties for overcharge. Upon receipt of a copy of a rent increase exemption order/tax abatement certificate, the housing company managing the dwelling unit of the eligible head of the household shall promptly accord to
    the eligible head of the household covered by such order/certificate the appropriate credit against the monthly maximum rent then and thereafter payable. To the extent the full amount of such credit has not been accorded for any past period since
    the effective date specified in the order/certificate, the housing company shall credit the total aggregate amount not so credited to the monthly maximum rent next payable or to such subsequent monthly maximum rents, as the supervising agency may
    authorize. It shall be illegal to collect any amount for which a rent increase exemption order/tax abatement certificate provides credit or to withhold credit for any such amounts already collected, and collection or retention of any such amount for
    a dwelling unit occupied by such eligible head of the household shall be deemed a rent overcharge, and upon conviction therefor the housing company and its directors and any employee responsible therefor shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable
    by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars or imprisonment not to exceed six months, or both.</text>
