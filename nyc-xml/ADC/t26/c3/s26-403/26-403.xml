    housing accommodations consisting of self-contained family units as defined by regulations issued by the city rent agency, with due regard for the shortage of housing accommodations suitable for family occupancy and for the purposes of this chapter
    in relation thereto; and provided further, that any such order of decontrol of the state rent commission or the city rent agency shall remain effective after April thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty-two only so long as the housing accommodations are
    not occupied for other than single family occupancy; and provided further, that any such order of decontrol shall not apply to that portion of the original housing accommodations occupied by a tenant in possession at the time of the conversion, but

    than single family occupancy; or (4) Housing accommodations in one or two family houses which were or shall become vacant on or after April first, nineteen hundred fifty-three; provided, however, that this exemption shall remain effective only so
    long as the housing accommodations are not occupied for other than single family occupancy; or (6) (i) Such housing accommodations resulting from substantial demolition (as such accommodations are defined in this item six), as are decontrolled by
    order of the city rent agency pursuant to this item six; provided that all housing accommodations resulting from substantial demolition which are not so decontrolled shall continue to be housing accommodations subject to rent control under this chapter
    and the regulations thereunder. (ii) The term "housing accommodation resulting from substantial demolition", as used herein, shall mean any housing accommodation (a) which is created on or after May first, nineteen hundred sixty-two, as a result of
    the substantial demolition of a multiple dwelling and the reconstruction of such building in such manner as to retain any portion thereof existing prior to such demolition, and (b) which is so created after the issuance of one or more certificates
    permitting the eviction of any tenant or tenants of such multiple dwelling for the purpose of effecting such demolition. (iii) No order shall be issued under this item six decontrolling any housing accommodation resulting from substantial demolition
    unless, after such reconstruction, all housing accommodations in the building are self-contained family units as defined by regulations issued by the city rent agency, with due regard for the shortage of housing accommodations suitable for family
    occupancy and for the purposes of this chapter in relation thereto. (iv) The city rent agency shall issue regulations, with due regard for such shortage and purposes, specifying minimum requirements for qualifying any housing accommodation resulting
    from substantial demolition as suitable for occupancy by larger families (including, with respect to the individual unit, but not limited to, number of rooms, space suitable for sleeping purposes and total floor area) and likewise prescribing, subject
    to such variations and classifications as such agency may determine to be reasonably necessary, the ratio between the total number of housing accommodations resulting from substantial demolition in the building, and the number of such accommodations
    which must meet such requirements for larger family occupancy, in order that a decontrol order may be granted hereunder. (v) The city rent agency shall issue an order decontrolling all of the housing accommodations resulting from substantial demolition
    in the building, if such accommodations meet the requirements of sub-item (iii) of this item six, and if the prescribed proportion thereof meets the requirements of sub-item (iv) of this item six for larger family occupancy; provided that (a) if all
    such accommodations meet the requirements of such sub-item (iii), but less than the prescribed proportion thereof meet the requirements of such sub-item (iv), then the city rent agency shall issue an order decontrolling only those accommodations which
    meet the requirements of both such sub-items; and (b) any order of decontrol issued under this item six shall remain effective only so long as the accommodations decontrolled by such order are not occupied for other than single family occupancy. (vi)

    such reconstruction occurred after the structure was vacated by voluntary surrender of possession, or in the manner provided in this chapter; or (7) (i) Individual housing accommodations having unfurnished maximum rents of two hundred and fifty dollars

    per month as of April first, nineteen hundred sixty, or furnished maximum rents of three hundred dollars to three hundred fifty-nine dollars and ninety-nine cents inclusive, per month as of April first, nineteen hundred sixty; provided, however, that
    where any such housing accommodation is occupied by a tenant whose household contains one or more children attending an elementary or secondary school, such housing accommodation shall continue to remain subject to control under this chapter and the

    related persons, it shall continue to remain subject to control under this chapter and the regulations thereunder so long as such tenant remains in occupancy. (iv) The exemptions provided for in this item seven shall remain effective only so long
    as the housing accommodations are not occupied for other than single family occupancy. (v) The term "related persons", as used in this item seven, shall be limited to the tenant and a parent, grandparent, child, stepchild, grandchild, brother or sister
    of the tenant or of the tenant's spouse or the spouse of any of the foregoing, who customarily occupied the housing accommodation on and before the effective date of this item seven. The tenant's spouse or an unmarried child or grandchild of the tenant
    who temporarily resided elsewhere on the effective date of this item seven because of attendance at an educational institution or service in the armed forces of the United States shall be deemed to be a related person in occupancy. (8) No more than

    injunctive relief and enforcement penalties and remedies authorized by section 26-413 of this chapter, no housing accommodation in such structure shall be decontrolled pursuant to this item eight until a minimum period of three years has elapsed since
