  <text>ยง 26-406 Tax abatement for properties subject to rent exemption orders. a. Tax abatement, pursuant to the provisions of section four hundred sixty-seven-b of the real property tax law, shall be granted with respect to any real property for which a rent
    exemption order is issued under subdivision m of section 26-405 of this chapter to the tenant of any housing accommodation contained therein. The rent exemption order shall constitute the tax abatement certificate. b. The real estate tax imposed upon
    any real property for which a rent exemption order is issued, shall be reduced and abated by an amount equal to the difference between (1) the sum of the maximum rents collectible under such orders, and (2) the sum of rents that would be collectible
    from the tenants of such housing accommodations if no exemption had been granted pursuant to subdivision m of section 26-405 of this chapter. c. For any individual housing accommodation, the tax abatement computed pursuant to subdivision b of this
    section shall be available with respect to a period commencing on the effective date of the initial rent exemption order, or January first, nineteen hundred seventy-two, whichever is later, and ending on the expiration date of such order or on the
    effective date of an order terminating the rent exemption. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when a head of a household to whom a then current, valid tax abatement certificate has been issued under this chapter, chapter four or chapter seven
    of this title moves his or her principal residence to a subsequent dwelling unit subject to regulation under this chapter, the head of the household may apply to the department of finance or such other agency as the mayor shall designate for a tax
    abatement certificate relating to the subsequent dwelling unit, and such certificate may provide that the head of the household shall be exempt from paying that portion of the maximum rent for the subsequent dwelling unit which is the least of the
    following: (1) the amount by which the rent for the subsequent dwelling unit exceeds the last rent, as reduced, which the head of the household was required to actually pay in the original dwelling unit; (2) the last amount deducted from the maximum
    rent or legal regulated rent meaning the most recent monthly deduction for the applicant in the original dwelling unit pursuant to this section, section 26-509 or section 26-605 of this title; or (3) where the head of the household does not receive
    a monthly allowance for shelter pursuant to the social services law, the amount by which the maximum rent or legal regulated rent of the subsequent dwelling unit exceeds one-third of the combined income of all members of the household. Such certificate
    shall be effective as of the first day of the month in which the tenant applied for such exemption or as of the date the tenant took occupancy of the subsequent dwelling unit, whichever is later, provided both occur after the effective date of this
    law. d. Prior to the commencement of each fiscal year, the department of finance shall determine the total amount of taxes to be abated under this section with respect to each property for which rent exemption orders granted to persons sixty-two years
    of age or older were in effect for all or any part of the preceding calendar year. Prior to the commencement of each fiscal year, such agency as the mayor shall designate shall determine and, if such agency is not the department of finance, shall
    notify the department of finance of the total amount of taxes to be abated under this section with respect to each property for which rent exemption orders granted to persons with disabilities were in effect for all or any part of the preceding calendar
    year. The commissioner of finance shall make the appropriate adjustment in the real estate tax payable in such fiscal year. e. Tax abatement pursuant to this section shall be in addition to any other tax abatement authorized by law, but shall not
    reduce the tax for any fiscal year below zero. In the event that the tax abatement certificate authorizes an amount of deduction in excess of the real estate installment, then the balance may be applied to any subsequent installment until exhausted.
    In such a case the owner shall submit with his or her real estate tax bill and remittance, a verified statement in such form as prescribed by the commissioner of finance setting forth the carry over amount and the amounts previously applied; provided,
    however, that at the request of the owner such balance shall be paid to the owner by the commissioner of finance in lieu of being applied to any subsequent installment, except where the owner is in arrears in the payment of real estate taxes on any
    property. For the purposes of this subdivision, where the owner is a corporation, it shall be deemed to be in arrears when any of the officers, directors or any person holding an interest in more than ten percent of the issued and outstanding stock
    of such corporation is in arrears in the payment of real estate taxes on any property; where title is held by a nominee, the owner shall be deemed to be in arrears when the person for whose benefit such title is held is in arrears in the payment of
    real estate taxes on any property.</text>
