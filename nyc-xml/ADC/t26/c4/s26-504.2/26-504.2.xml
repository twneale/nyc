  <text>* ยง 26-504.2 Exclusion of high rent accommodations. a. "Housing accommodations" shall not include: any housing accommodation which becomes vacant on or after April first, nineteen hundred ninety-seven and before the effective date of the rent act of
    2011 and where at the time the tenant vacated such housing accommodation the legal regulated rent was two thousand dollars or more per month; or, for any housing accommodation which is or becomes vacant on or after the effective date of the rent regulation
    reform act of 1997 and before the effective date of the rent act of 2011, with a legal regulated rent of two thousand dollars or more per month. This exclusion shall apply regardless of whether the next tenant in occupancy or any subsequent tenant
    in occupancy is charged or pays less than two thousand dollars a month; or, for any housing accommodation with a legal regulated rent of two thousand five hundred dollars or more per month at any time on or after the effective date of the rent act
    of 2011, which is or becomes vacant on or after such effective date. This exclusion shall apply regardless of whether the next tenant in occupancy or any subsequent tenant in occupancy actually is charged or pays less than two thousand five hundred
    dollars a month. Provided however, that an exclusion pursuant to this subdivision shall not apply to housing accommodations which became or become subject to this law (a) by virtue of receiving tax benefits pursuant to section four hundred twenty-one-a
    or four hundred eighty-nine of the real property tax law, except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (f) of subdivision two of section four hundred twenty-one-a of the real property tax law, or (b) by virtue of article seven-C of
    the multiple dwelling law. This section shall not apply, however, to or become effective with respect to housing accommodations which the commissioner determines or finds that the landlord or any person acting on his or her behalf, with intent to
    cause the tenant to vacate, engaged in any course of conduct (including, but not limited to, interruption or discontinuance of required services) which interfered with or disturbed or was intended to interfere with or disturb the comfort, repose,
    peace or quiet of the tenant in his or her use or occupancy of the housing accommodations and in connection with such course of conduct, any other general enforcement provision of this law shall also apply. b. The owner of any housing accommodation
    that is not subject to this law pursuant to the provisions of subdivision a of this section or subparagraph k of paragraph 2 of subdivision e of section 26-403 of this code shall give written notice certified by such owner to the first tenant of that
    housing accommodation after such housing accommodation becomes exempt from the provisions of this law or the city rent and rehabilitation law. Such notice shall contain the last regulated rent, the reason that such housing accommodation is not subject
    to this law or the city rent and rehabilitation law, a calculation of how either the rental amount charged when there is no lease or the rental amount provided for in the lease has been derived so as to reach two thousand dollars or more per month
    or, for a housing accommodation with a legal regulated rent or maximum rent of two thousand five hundred dollars or more per month on or after the effective date of the rent act of 2011, which is or becomes vacant on or after such effective date,
    whether the next tenant in occupancy or any subsequent tenant in occupancy actually is charged or pays less than a legal regulated rent or maximum rent of two thousand five hundred dollars or more per month, a statement that the last legal regulated
    rent or the maximum rent may be verified by the tenant by contacting the state division of housing and community renewal, or any successor thereto, and the address and telephone number of such agency, or any successor thereto. Such notice shall be
    sent by certified mail within thirty days after the tenancy commences or after the signing of the lease by both parties, whichever occurs first or shall be delivered to the tenant at the signing of the lease. In addition, the owner shall send and
    certify to the tenant a copy of the registration statement for such housing accommodation filed with the state division of housing and community renewal indicating that such housing accommodation became exempt from the provisions of this law or the
    city rent and rehabilitation law, which form shall include the last regulated rent, and shall be sent to the tenant within thirty days after the tenancy commences or the filing of such registration, whichever occurs later. * NB Expires April 1, 2015</text>
