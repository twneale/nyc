  <text>ยง 20-266.1 Refusal to issue or renew, or suspension or revocation based on criminal conviction. In addition to any of the powers that may be exercised by the commissioner pursuant to this subchapter or chapter one of this title, the commissioner, after
    notice and an opportunity to be heard, may refuse to issue or renew, or may suspend or revoke, a license required under this subchapter if the applicant or licensee, or any of its principals, officers or directors, or any of its stockholders owning
    more than ten percent of the outstanding stock of the corporation has been convicted of a crime which, in the judgment of the commissioner, has a direct relationship to such person's fitness or ability to perform any of the activities for which a
    license is required under this subchapter or has been convicted of any other crime which, in accordance with article twenty-three-a of the correction law, would provide a justification for the commissioner to refuse to issue or renew, or to suspend
    or revoke, such license.</text>
