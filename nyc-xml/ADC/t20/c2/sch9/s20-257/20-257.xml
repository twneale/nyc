  <text>ยง 20-257 Pedicab driver license. a. It shall be unlawful for a pedicab driver to operate a pedicab unless the pedicab driver shall have first obtained a pedicab driver license from the commissioner. b. It shall be unlawful for a pedicab business to
    permit the operation of any pedicabs owned by it by a person who does not have a pedicab driver license and a motor vehicle driver's license in full force and effect. c. In order to obtain or renew a pedicab driver license, a pedicab driver shall
    file an application with the commissioner for such pedicab driver license. Such application shall be made upon such form as prescribed by the commissioner and shall contain such information as the commissioner may require to establish the applicant's
    eligibility for a pedicab driver license under this subchapter. d. To be eligible for or to maintain a pedicab driver license, an applicant or licensee shall: 1. be at least eighteen years of age; 2. possess a currently valid motor vehicle driver's
    license that is in full force and effect; 3. not have his or her motor vehicle driver's license suspended or revoked; and 4. meet such fitness requirements as the commissioner may determine by rule. e. A pedicab driver license shall be valid for a
    term of one year. There shall be a fee of thirty-five dollars for such license. The commissioner shall establish the expiration date for such license by rule. f. The commissioner may refuse to issue a pedicab driver license or to renew such a license
    based upon a determination that such pedicab driver has engaged in conduct which would constitute a basis for the suspension or revocation of a pedicab driver license as set forth in subdivision c of section 20-261 of this subchapter. g. Service of
    a violation, and any related notices, on a pedicab driver shall constitute service on the pedicab business that authorized the operation of such pedicab by virtue of employment, lease, or any other arrangement and shall afford the pedicab business
    the opportunity to participate in any hearing held on such violation.</text>
