    a pedicab business license, a pedicab owner must provide the commissioner with the following: 1. A list of all pedicabs owned, leased or controlled by such pedicab owner for which such owner seeks registration pursuant to section 20-255. Each such
    pedicab shall be uniquely identified on such list; 2. Proof that there is in force for the full license term a policy of public liability and property damage insurance that meets the requirements of section 20-253 of this subchapter for each pedicab
    listed pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision; and 3. Such other information as the commissioner may require to establish the pedicab owner's eligibility for a pedicab business license under this subchapter. c. A pedicab business license shall
    be valid for a term of one year, except that business licenses issued prior to November 1, 2010 shall expire on November 1, 2010. There shall be an annual fee of one hundred and ten dollars for such license that shall include the fee for registration,
    required by section 20-255, of one pedicab. The registration fee for each additional pedicab shall be sixty dollars. The annual fee may be pro-rated by the commissioner for the initial license period. d. Notwithstanding subdivision a of this section,
    a person holding a pedicab driver license shall not be required to obtain a pedicab business license to drive a pedicab that is owned by a pedicab business licensed under this subchapter. e. The commissioner shall have the authority to deny or revoke
    a pedicab business license if a pedicab owner fails to obtain the registration plates required pursuant to section 20-255 for the pedicab(s) identified on the list submitted by such owner pursuant to paragraph 1 of subdivision b of this section.</text>
