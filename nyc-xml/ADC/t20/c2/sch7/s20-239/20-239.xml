  <text>ยง 20-239 Approval. A stoop line stand shall not be licensed unless the location thereof has been approved by the department of transportation. No license shall be approved or renewed if the department of transportation determines that the stoop line
    stand poses an obstruction to the free use of sidewalks by pedestrians. Notwithstanding anything in this subchapter to the contrary, if the department of transportation determines that a stoop line stand which is permitted to extend more than four
    feet in width pursuant to section 20-237 of this subchapter poses an obstruction to the free use of sidewalks by pedestrians solely because the width of such stoop line stand exceeds four feet, the commissioner shall approve or renew such license
    at a width of four feet.
