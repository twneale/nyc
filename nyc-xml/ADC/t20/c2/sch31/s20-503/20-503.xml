  <text>§ 20-503 Issuance of license plate. Upon approval of an application to engage in towing, the commissioner shall issue to the licensee a license plate for each tow truck to be used under such license. Such license plate shall be securely affixed to a
    conspicuous and indispensable part of such truck, and shall clearly set forth the license number assigned to the licensee. The license plate issued to the licensee may, in the discretion of the commissioner, be a plate of a permanent nature with a
    replaceable date tag attached thereto, indicating the expiration date of the plate. Such license and replaceable date tag shall be of such material, form, design and dimension as the commissioner shall prescribe. The commissioner, upon renewal of
    a license to engage in towing, may continue the use of the license plate for as many additional license terms as he or she may determine, in which event he or she shall issue and deliver to the licensee a replaceable date tag as evidence of renewal
    of license, which shall be attached or affixed in such manner as he or she may prescribe. The failure to affix or display such date tag in a manner prescribed by the commissioner shall constitute a violation of this section. In the event of the loss,
    mutilation or destruction of any license plate or date tag issued hereunder, the licensee may file such statement and proof of facts as the commissioner shall require, with a fee of twenty-five dollars per plate or date tag, at the department, and
    the department shall issue a duplicate or substitute license plate or date tag.</text>
