    into a signed agreement with the person in charge of the vehicle authorizing such repairs. The commissioner shall prescribe the form to be used for such agreement. In addition to any other information required to be set forth in such agreement, the
    commissioner shall require that such agreement set forth the registration number assigned to the licensee's repair shop pursuant to section three hundred ninety-eight-c of the vehicle and traffic law. b. In any case where the tow truck operator knows
    that the person in charge of a vehicle is injured and is to be removed to a hospital, it shall be unlawful to enter into an agreement authorizing repairs with such injured person until the expiration of a period of at least twenty-four hours from
    the time of the accident, unless the injured person is not admitted to or has been discharged from the hospital before the expiration of such period.</text>
