  <text>§ 20-505 Tow truck operator's license suspension or revocation; special circumstances. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, where the commissioner has reason to believe that a tow truck operator has committed an act which would provide a basis
    for suspension or revocation under section 20-504 or 20-504.1 of this subchapter, and the continued possession by such person of a tow truck operator's license would pose a serious danger to the safety of the public, the commissioner may immediately
    suspend his or her tow truck operator's license. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, upon the suspension or revocation pursuant to the vehicle and traffic law of a license to operate a motor vehicle that is held by a person who also holds
    a tow truck operator's license pursuant to this subchapter, the commissioner shall immediately suspend his or her tow truck operator's license. Notice of the suspension of a tow truck operator's license pursuant to this section shall be served on
    the operator and on the person who employs such operator to operate a tow truck. The commissioner shall provide the operator with the opportunity for a hearing within five days after the notification of suspension, after which the commissioner shall
    forthwith make a determination as to whether such suspension should continue and in addition may impose any penalty or sanction provided for under this subchapter, provided, however that where the license to operate a motor vehicle held by a tow truck
    operator has been revoked pursuant to the vehicle and traffic law, the commissioner shall revoke such person's tow truck operator's license issued pursuant to this subchapter.
