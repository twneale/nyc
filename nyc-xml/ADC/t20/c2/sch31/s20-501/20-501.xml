  <text>ยง 20-501 Inspection of tow trucks. a. No license to engage in towing shall be issued pursuant to this subchapter unless the commissioner determines that every tow truck to be used by the applicant under such license is fit for operation as a towing
    vehicle and is otherwise in compliance with the provisions of the vehicle and traffic law and any regulations promulgated thereunder. b. The commissioner may require by regulation that every tow truck used by a licensee be inspected periodically by
    the department, and after finding such truck to be fit for operation, may issue a replaceable inspection sticker of such material, form, design and dimension to be affixed to such truck in such manner as he or she shall prescribe. The commissioner
    may by regulation impose a fee for any inspection in an amount not to exceed fifty dollars in order to defray the costs of conducting any such inspection. c. Where a holder of a license to engage in towing acquires a tow truck subsequent to the date
    such license was issued intended for use under such license or intends to utilize a truck not previously identified in any application for a license to engage in towing, such licensee shall be prohibited from using such truck for towing until the
    licensee has furnished proof that such truck is insured as required by section 20-500, and that such truck has been inspected and approved for use by the department pursuant to this section and the commissioner has issued a license plate therefor
    pursuant to section 20-503 of this subchapter.
