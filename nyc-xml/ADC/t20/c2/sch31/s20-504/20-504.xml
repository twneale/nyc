  <text>ยง 20-504 Renewal, suspension and revocation of licenses. After due notice and opportunity to be heard, the commissioner may refuse to renew any license required under this subchapter and may suspend or revoke any such license upon the occurrence of
    any one or more of the following conditions: a. the person holding a tow truck operator's license, or the person holding a license to engage in towing or where applicable its officers, principals, directors, employees, or stockholders owning more
    than ten percent of the outstanding stock of the corporation have been found by the commissioner to have violated any provisions of this subchapter or any rule promulgated thereunder; or b. the person holding a tow truck operator's license, or the
    person holding a license to engage in towing or where applicable its officers, principals, directors, employees, or stockholders owning more than ten percent of the outstanding stock of the corporation were found to have operated a tow truck in a
    grossly negligent manner or in a manner showing a reckless disregard for life or property. For purposes of this subdivision, a finding that any such person violated section eleven hundred ninety-two of the vehicle and traffic law in the course of
    the operation of a tow truck shall be deemed gross negligence; or c. the person holding a tow truck operator's license, or the person holding a license to engage in towing or where applicable its officers, principals, directors or stockholders owning
    more than ten percent of the outstanding stock of the corporation have made a material false statement or concealed a material fact in connection with the filing of any application pursuant to this subchapter or have engaged in fraud or misrepresentation
    in connection with the rendering of services; or d. the person holding a tow truck operator's license, or the person holding a license to engage in towing or where applicable its officers, principals, directors or stockholders owning more than ten
    percent of the outstanding stock of the corporation have not paid, within the time permitted by law, any fine, penalty or judgment duly imposed pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter or any rule or regulation promulgated hereunder or duly imposed
    in connection with or arising from the use or operation of a tow truck or the occupation of the premises on which the licensed business is conducted; or e. the person holding a tow truck operator's license, or the person holding a license to engage
    in towing or where applicable any of its officers, principals, directors or stockholders owning more than ten percent of the outstanding stock of the corporation has been convicted of a crime which, in the judgment of the commissioner, has a direct
    relationship to such person's fitness or ability to perform any of the activities for which a license is required under this subchapter; or has been convicted of any other crime which, in accordance with article twenty-three-a of the correction law,
    would provide a justification for the commissioner to refuse to renew, or to suspend or revoke, such license; or f. the person holding a tow truck operator's license, or the person holding a license to engage in towing has failed to maintain any of
    the conditions for issuance of such license as provided under this subchapter or any rule or regulation promulgated hereunder.</text>
