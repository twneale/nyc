  <text>ยง 20-509 Rates. a. Except as otherwise provided, charges for the towing of vehicles shall not exceed one hundred dollars; provided, however, that where a motor vehicle has been booted by a person licensed pursuant to subchapter 32 of this chapter in
    a private lot as defined in paragraph 3 of subdivision b of section 20-531 of such subchapter and such vehicle is subsequently towed, no additional charge may be imposed for the towing of such vehicle. b. Except as otherwise provided, charges for
    storage of vehicles shall not exceed twenty-five dollars for each twenty-four hours or fraction thereof for the first three days of storage and twenty-seven dollars for the fourth day of storage and each day thereafter. c. The commissioner may, by
    rule, authorize such additional charges for services necessary to prepare a vehicle for towing, including but not limited to charges for additional labor necessary for positioning a vehicle for towing, which in the judgment of the commissioner shall
    be fair and reasonable. In promulgating a rule pursuant to this subdivision, the commissioner shall consult with the tow advisory board. d. (1) No tow truck operator shall require the payment of any fee or charge for towing and storage of a vehicle,
    or any fee or charge directly or indirectly related to towing and storage of a vehicle, that is not specifically authorized by law or rule. (2) No charge for the towing and storage of vehicles may be imposed by any person who does not have a license
    to engage in towing as required by this subchapter at the time that the towing and storage services are performed.
