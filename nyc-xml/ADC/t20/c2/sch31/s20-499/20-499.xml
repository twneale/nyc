  <text>ยง 20-499 Bond. a. As a condition of the issuance of a license to engage in towing, each applicant shall furnish to the commissioner a surety bond in the sum of five thousand dollars, payable to the city of New York, executed by the applicant and a surety
    approved by the commissioner. Such bond shall be conditioned upon the applicant's compliance with the provisions of this subchapter and any rules or regulations promulgated hereunder, and upon the further condition that the applicant will pay to the
    city any fine, penalty or other obligation within thirty days of its imposition, or any final judgment recovered by any person who received towing services from a licensee thereunder and was damaged thereby. The commissioner may in his or her discretion,
    after a public hearing, five days notice of which shall be published in the City Record, increase the amount of the surety bond required by this section to an amount not to exceed twenty-five thousand dollars. The commissioner may by regulation authorize
    an applicant to, in lieu of a bond, deposit cash to satisfy the requirements of this section in an amount equal to the sum of the surety bond required by this section. b. The commissioner may by regulation establish a fund to be administered by the
    comptroller and authorize an applicant for a license to engage in towing to, in lieu of a bond or cash equivalent, make contributions to such fund to satisfy the requirements of subdivision a of this section. The commissioner may promulgate such rules
    or regulations as are necessary for the administration of such fund including, but not limited to, regulations setting forth the conditions for participation in the fund, the contributions required to be made to the fund and the circumstances under
    which disbursements will be made from the fund.</text>
