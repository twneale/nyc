  <text>* ยง 20-518.1 Special accident response districts. a. 1. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provisions of this subchapter, the commissioner may by rule designate one or more areas of the city as a special accident response district, provided, however,
    that such special accident response districts shall not in combination encompass more than seven police precincts. One but not more than three towing companies shall be assigned by the commissioner to each zone located in a special accident response
    district and shall have the responsibility of removing vehicles that have been involved in a vehicular accident in such zone and which cannot be safely driven under their own power. No more than one such towing company shall have the responsibility
    for removing such vehicles in a particular zone within a special accident response district during any specified period of time. The commissioner may by rule prescribe which vehicles involved in vehicular accidents cannot be safely driven under their
    own power. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the commissioner may by rule establish an alternative procedure for providing towing services for accident vehicles in certain circumstances where towing services will not be adequately
    provided by the towing companies participating in the special accident response districts. 2. The commissioner, after consultation with the police commissioner and the tow advisory board created pursuant to section 20-526 of this subchapter, shall
    set forth by rule the division of a special accident response district into zones for the removal of accident vehicles and may modify the zones from time to time to ensure sufficient towing services throughout such district. In determining the boundaries
    of the zones, the commissioner may consider, but shall not be limited to considering, the following: (a) the boundaries of police precincts, commands and sectors; (b) vehicular accident statistics; (c) traffic patterns and other factors related to
    the response time of towing companies; and (d) the density of licensed towing company facilities. b. 1. The commissioner shall set forth by rule such criteria for pre-qualifying a towing company to apply for a particular zone or zones in a special
    accident response district as he or she deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section. Such criteria shall include, but not be limited to (a) possession for a period of not less than one year of a valid, current license to engage in towing
    issued pursuant to this subchapter, which license has not been revoked after due notice and an opportunity to be heard at any time during the preceding two year period, (b) possession of a satisfactory record with regard to operation of a towing business
    as determined by the commissioner, provided that a determination that such record with regard to the operation of a towing business is unsatisfactory shall be based upon violations of this subchapter and any rules promulgated thereunder, (c) fitness
    to provide towing service, (d) ability to respond within a specified period of time to an accident that has occurred in the zone, (e) the proximity of the towing company's place of business and storage facilities to the zone applied for, (f) ability
    to make service available on a twenty-four hour basis, (g) maintenance of specified business hours for redemption of vehicles, (h) registration as a repair shop pursuant to article twelve-A of the vehicle and traffic law, and (i) maintenance of a
    minimum number of tow trucks and other equipment appropriate for towing. In addition to such criteria, a towing company shall maintain a business premises that is under the exclusive control of such towing company, is not used by any other towing
    company and is the premises listed on such towing company's license to engage in towing. Such premises shall consist of a location that is open to the public, where towing company personnel are employed, calls requesting towing service are received
    and towers are dispatched, and where all records required by this subchapter or any rules promulgated thereunder are maintained. 2. Where more than one towing company meets the criteria for assignment to a particular zone, the commissioner may use
    random selection procedures such as a lottery to assign a towing company to such zone and to a specified time period. Zone assignment shall be for such period of time as the commissioner shall proscribe by rule. 3. The commissioner shall by rule establish
    procedures to be followed in the event that it is impracticable or impossible for the towing company assigned to a zone and to a specified time period to respond to an accident scene or to remove a vehicle therefrom in a timely manner, and the commissioner
    may pre-qualify towing companies to serve as a back-up response in such event. 4. The commissioner may by rule establish standards of service and performance and methods of identification of tow trucks which shall be complied with by all towing companies
    assigned by the commissioner to have the responsibility for removing accident vehicles in a zone. The commissioner shall not require the full body of a tow truck of such towing company to be painted a certain color. c. 1. Any vehicle located in a
    zone in a special accident response district that has been involved in a vehicular accident and which cannot be safely driven under its own power which has not been removed or caused to be removed from the scene of an accident shall be removed by
    a tow truck of the towing company authorized by the commissioner to remove such vehicle from such zone at that particular time. No such vehicle, other than a vehicle that has a maximum gross vehicle weight of at least fifteen thousand pounds, may
    be removed by a tow operator chosen by a person in charge of such vehicle. 2. No tow truck operator shall travel enroute to, or respond to, the scene of a vehicular accident, or remove a vehicle therefrom, in a zone located within a special accident
    response district unless a specific request for the services of such tow truck operator has been received by such operator or the towing company which employs such operator from a person in charge of a vehicle that has a maximum gross vehicle weight
    of at least fifteen thousand pounds, or unless such operator has been assigned by the commissioner to have the responsibility for removing accident vehicles in such zone located within a special accident response district at that particular time,
    or has been pre-qualified by the commissioner and has been directed to serve as a back-up response at that particular time, or is otherwise authorized by the commissioner to remove a vehicle therefrom. 3. No tow truck of the towing company authorized
    by the commissioner to remove vehicles involved in a vehicular accident in a zone located within a special accident response district shall fail to or refuse to remove a vehicle that has been involved in a vehicular accident in such zone and which
    cannot be safely driven under its own power which has not been removed or caused to be removed from the scene of an accident. Such vehicle shall be towed by a tow truck of such responding towing company to the storage facility of such company, which
    facility shall meet such specifications as the commissioner shall establish by rule, or to a location designated by the person in charge of such vehicle, provided, however, that such location is within the police precinct in which the vehicular accident
    occurred or a police precinct directly adjacent thereto and placement of such vehicle in such location is not in violation of any other law. A vehicle towed to a storage facility shall at all times be stored within such facility while the vehicle
    is in the custody of the towing company. Such storage facility shall be the premises listed on the license of the towing company or the premises approved by the commissioner for use by such towing company. Such premises shall be owned, operated or
    controlled by such towing company and shall not be used by any other towing company. In order to respond to the scene of an accident in the towing company's assigned zone, such company shall be permitted to maintain and use in such company's place
    of business for the purpose of receiving and monitoring police communications a radio receiving set or other device capable of receiving signals or messages transmitted on the frequencies allocated for police use. d. The commissioner may impose a
    fee upon a towing company which has been assigned to a zone pursuant to this section in order to defray the expenses incurred in the administration and enforcement of this section. e. The police department shall maintain a record of such information
    as the commissioner, after consultation with the police commissioner, may prescribe as would be useful in determining the effectiveness of special accident response districts. f. In addition to the obligation to make records available for inspection
    by the commissioner pursuant to section 20-516 of this subchapter, every towing company which has been assigned to a zone pursuant to this section shall, at the request of the police department and for the purpose of the enforcement of this section
    or any rules promulgated hereunder, make available for inspection by the police department, during reasonable business hours, any records required to be maintained under this subchapter. g. After due notice and an opportunity to be heard, the commissioner
    may remove any towing company from the responsibility for removing accident vehicles in a particular zone during a specified time period where the commissioner finds that the towing company has not complied with the standards of service and performance
    prescribed by rule, has engaged in any fraudulent business practices or has violated any of the provisions of this subchapter or any rules promulgated hereunder, or upon the occurrence of any one or more of the conditions set forth in this subchapter
    which constitute grounds for suspension or revocation of any license issued under the subchapter; provided, however, that the commissioner, for good cause, may, prior to giving notice and an opportunity to be heard, temporarily suspend a towing company
    from the responsibility for removing accident vehicles in a particular zone during a specified time period for up to ten days. Notice of such suspension shall be served on the towing company. The commissioner shall provide the towing company with
    the opportunity for a hearing within ten days after the notification of suspension, after which the commissioner shall forthwith make a determination as to whether such suspension should continue and the length of such suspension, and in addition
    may impose any penalty or sanction authorized by this subchapter. In the event of the removal, termination or withdrawal of any towing company from the responsibility for removing accident vehicles in a particular zone, the commissioner shall, pursuant
    to the procedures described in subdivision b of this section and any rules promulgated thereunder, select a new towing company to provide towing service in the zone during a specified time period for the unexpired portion of the term. h. Any person
    participating in the removal of vehicles involved in a vehicular accident in a zone located within a special accident response district who violates the provisions of section 20-496 of this subchapter regarding engaging in towing without having first
    obtained a license for such towing business and a license plate for each tow truck, driving or otherwise operating a tow truck or assisting in any activity for which a license is required under this subchapter without having first obtained a tow truck
    operator's license, or permitting or authorizing the driving or other operation of a tow truck by a person who does not possess a current, valid tow truck operator's license in violation of subdivision c of section 20-496 of this subchapter shall
    be removed from the responsibility for removing accident vehicles in a particular zone during a specified time period and shall be ineligible for participation in the removal of accident vehicles in zones located within special accident response districts
    for a period of six months. Any such person who has been found guilty of two such violations within the preceding twenty-four month period shall be ineligible for participation in the removal of accident vehicles in zones located within special accident
    response districts for a period of one year. i. The provisions of this section shall not apply to the removal of a vehicle that is located in a zone designated by the commissioner as part of the "directed accident response program" pursuant to section
    20-518 of this subchapter or to the removal of a vehicle from any location for which the authorization of the commissioner of transportation or the police commissioner is required to remove such vehicle therefrom. j. The commissioner may promulgate
    such additional rules as he or she deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section. * NB Expired December 31, 1997</text>
