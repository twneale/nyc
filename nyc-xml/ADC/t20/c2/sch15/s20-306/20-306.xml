  <text>ยง 20-306 Proof of qualifications; fingerprinting. a. The commissioner shall require any applicant for a locksmith's license to furnish documentary proof that he or she is a qualified locksmith, and if such evidence is not satisfactory to the commissioner,
    the commissioner may require the applicant to submit to any examination by at least two licensed locksmiths to be named by the commissioner, to serve without compensation, and such licensed locksmiths, after examining the applicant shall certify in
    writing to the commissioner whether or not the applicant in their opinion is sufficiently qualified to be licensed as a locksmith. b. The commissioner shall require that applicants for licenses issued pursuant to this subchapter be fingerprinted for
    the purpose of securing criminal history records from the state division of criminal justice services. The applicant shall pay a processing fee as required by the state division of criminal justice services. Fingerprints shall be taken of the individual
    owner if the applicant is a sole proprietorship; the general partners if the applicant is a partnership; and the officers, principals, directors, and stockholders owning more than ten percent of the outstanding stock of the corporation if the applicant
    is a corporation. Any person required to be fingerprinted hereunder shall furnish to the department three current passport-size photographs of such person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the commissioner need not require applicants for licenses required
    under this subchapter to be fingerprinted if criminal history records concerning such applicants are not available from the state division of criminal justice services.</text>
