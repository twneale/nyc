  <text>20-493.2 Prohibited collection practices. In addition to any practices prohibited under any federal, state or local law, a debt collection agency shall not: a. Attempt to collect or contact a consumer regarding a debt after such consumer requests verification
    for such debt until such agency furnishes such consumer written documentation identifying the creditor who originated the debt and itemizing the principal balance of the debt that remains or is alleged to remain due and all other charges that are
    due or alleged to be due; b. Contact a consumer about or seek to collect a debt on which the statute of limitations for initiating legal action has expired unless such agency first provides the consumer such information about the consumer's legal
    rights as the commissioner prescribes by rule.</text>
