  <text>ยง 20-434 Legislative intent. The council hereby declares that the raising of funds for the promotion of bona fide charitable, educational, scientific, health, religious, and patriotic causes and undertakings, where the beneficiaries are undetermined,
    is in the public interest. It hereby finds that, as conducted prior to the enactment of this subchapter, games of chance were the subject of exploitation by professional gamblers, promoters and commercial interests. It is hereby declared to be the
    policy of the council that all phases of supervision, licensing and regulation of games of chance and the conduct of games of chance should be closely controlled and that the local laws and regulations pertaining thereto should be strictly construed
    and rigidly enforced; that the conduct of the games and all attendant activities should be so regulated and adequate controls so instituted as to discourage commercialization in all its forms, including the rental of commercial premises for games
    of chance, and to ensure a maximum availability of the net proceeds of games of chance exclusively for application to the worthy causes and undertakings specified herein; that the only justification for this subchapter is to foster and support such
    worthy causes and undertakings, and that the mandate of section nine of article one of the state constitution, as amended, and of article nine-A of the general municipal law, should be carried out by rigid regulations to prevent commercialized gambling,
    prevent participation by criminal and other undesirable elements and prevent the diversion of funds from the purposes herein authorized.</text>
