  <text>§ 20-371 Licensing of sight-seeing buses, horse drawn cabs and horse drawn cab drivers. Legislative findings. The legislative findings heretofore made in relation to the business of sight-seeing buses and horse drawn cabs in the city of New York and
    set forth in local law number ten of nineteen hundred sixty-four continue to be valid; such businesses are vested with a public interest and their regulation and control continue to be necessary and essential in order to cope with certain evils and
    hazards which existed in the absence of governmental supervision. The supervision formerly was reposed in the police commissioner, but recent experience and study indicate that jurisdiction over such businesses should be transferred to the commissioner.
    It is further found that the present number of horse drawn cabs licensed in the city of New York is adequate to meet the public need and demand and should be preserved, unless the commissioner finds that additional licenses are necessary and advisable.</text>
