  <text>§ 20-373 License required; fee; term. a. It shall be unlawful to operate or permit another to operate for hire a sight-seeing bus or horse-drawn cab within the city unless the owner shall have first obtained a license therefor from the commissioner.
    An applicant for a horse-drawn cab license shall be at least eighteen years of age. b. Fees. The original and renewal license fee for each sight-seeing bus shall be fifty dollars and for each horse-drawn cab shall be fifty dollars. c. The commissioner
    shall not renew any horse-drawn cab license in the event that he or she shall determine that the horse-drawn cab has not been operated for at least four months during the preceding license year, provided that such failure to operate shall not have
    been caused by strike, riot, war or other public catastrophe. However, in the event that it is shown to the commissioner by competent proof that the licensee has been disabled through illness or has been unable to operate the horse-drawn cab because
    of other cause beyond his or her control, the commissioner may renew such license. d. The commissioner may refuse to renew any horse drawn cab license in the event that he or she determines that the holder of the horse drawn cab license has demonstrated
    a disregard for the provisions of this subchapter as illustrated by repeated violations of such provisions.</text>
