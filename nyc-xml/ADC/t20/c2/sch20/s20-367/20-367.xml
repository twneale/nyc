  <text>ยง 20-367 Places closed to public within certain hours. Premises licensed hereunder shall not be kept open for business, nor shall the public be permitted to enter or to remain therein, between four ante meridian and eight ante meridian; and if the occupant
    is a membership corporation, club, association, or society, its members or their guests shall not be permitted to enter or to remain therein between such hours. The commissioner, in his or her discretion, may permit any premises licensed hereunder
    to be open to the public between such hours on special occasions. If it appears to the commissioner that the place for which a license is sought will be frequented by minors, or if there is in the opinion of the commissioner any other good and sufficient
    reason therefor, he or she may grant a license upon the condition that the licensed premises shall not be open for business between one ante meridian and eight ante meridian.</text>
