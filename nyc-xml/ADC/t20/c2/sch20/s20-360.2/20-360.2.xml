    administrative law enforcement purpose; 10. All recordings made by video surveillance cameras installed and maintained pursuant to this section while in the possession of the cabaret or public dance hall shall be stored in a locked receptacle located
    in a controlled access area, to which only authorized personnel have access, or shall otherwise be secured so that only authorized personnel may access such video recordings. All personnel authorized to access such video recordings must certify in

    of the commissioner, to notify the public of its use of video surveillance equipment and the locations of video surveillance equipment so that the public has sufficient warning that surveillance is in operation. c. Each person subject to the provisions
    of this section shall submit, or ensure the submission of, a report to the department within thirty days after the effective date of this section, or, in the case of a new cabaret or public dance hall, within thirty days after the establishment of

    as shall be provided by rule of the commissioner. d. The department shall conduct periodic inspections of licensees to ensure compliance with the use and retention policies set forth in this section. e. The commissioner may suspend or revoke a cabaret
