  <text>ยง 20-474.1 Delivery to general vendors; distributor's license required. a. It shall be unlawful for any individual to transport goods by means of a motor vehicle, as defined in the vehicle and traffic law, to a public space for sale or other transfer
    to a general vendor, without having first obtained a distributor's license in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter. For the purpose of this section, "distributor" shall be defined as any person or organization engaged in the sale, consignment,
    or distribution of goods for sale or resale by a general vendor. This shall not include an owner of goods who personally operates a motor vehicle to transport such goods exclusively to and from a location from which the owner will personally sell
    such goods in compliance with all applicable laws. For the purpose of this section, "public space" shall be defined as all publicly owned property between the property lines on a street as such property lines are shown on the City map including but
    not limited to a park, plaza, roadway, shoulder, tree space, sidewalk or parking space between such property lines. It shall also include, but not be limited to, publicly owned or leased land, buildings, piers, wharfs, stadiums, and terminals. b.
    Where the distributor does not personally drive the vehicle, he or she shall cause the driver to carry proof of the distributor's license, which the driver shall furnish upon demand to any officer or agent empowered to enforce the law. No distributor
    shall permit any driver he or she employs to engage in, on the distributor's behalf, any of the activities for which a license is required unless such driver complies with all regulations promulgated pursuant to this subchapter. c. Each person applying
    for a distributor's license, or renewal thereof, shall file an application in such form and detail as the commissioner may prescribe and shall pay such license fee as shall be established by the commissioner by regulation. In addition to any other
    information required, the commissioner shall require the following information: 1. The name and home and business address of the applicant; 2. The name and home and business address of the owner, if other than the applicant, of the goods to be delivered;
    3. A description of the type of goods or services to be delivered; 4. Three prints of a full-face photograph of the applicant taken not more than thirty days prior to the date of the application; 5. Proof that the applicant has obtained from the state
    tax commission of the state of New York a certificate of authority designating the applicant's sales tax identification number; 6. An applicant who is a non-resident of the city shall provide the name and address of a registered agent within the city
    or designate the commissioner as his or her agent upon whom process or other notification may be served; 7. Any changes in the information provided in an application for an original license or renewal thereof, which arise during the term of the license
    shall be reported to the commissioner in writing within thirty days.
