  <text>ยง 20-225 Review and approval of petitions for revocable consents to construct and operate enclosed sidewalk cafes which do not require special permits. A petition for a revocable consent to construct and operate an enclosed sidewalk cafe which does
    not require a special permit modification pursuant to the zoning resolution shall be reviewed and approved in the following manner: a. The petition shall be in such form as prescribed by the department. The petition shall be filed with the department
    which, within five days of the filing of such petition, shall forward copies thereof to the department of city planning, the department of environmental protection and the landmarks preservation commission for review pursuant to subdivision b of this
    section. The department shall forward copies of the petition, within five days of the filing of such petition, to the speaker of the council and to the council member in whose district the cafe is proposed to be located, for informational purposes.
    b. The agencies to which the petition has been forwarded shall review the petition and shall indicate any objections to such petition, including any determination by the landmarks preservation commission that the petition requires a certificate of
    appropriateness, by filing written comments with the department of city planning within twenty-one days of the receipt thereof. The failure of an agency to indicate its objections within the prescribed time to the department of city planning shall
    be construed to mean that such agency has no objections. c. If no objections to such petition are filed within the twenty-one day period prescribed in subdivision b of this section, the department of city planning shall forward the petition within
    five days after the close of such period to the community board for the community district in which the cafe is proposed to be located, and such board shall review such petition pursuant to subdivision e of this section. d. If any objections exist,
    including any objections by the department of city planning, the department of city planning shall inform the petitioner of the objections and that review of the petition has been stayed until the objections indicated are resolved. If the objections
    are not resolved within six months from the date the petitioner is informed that review of the petition has been stayed, such petition shall be deemed to have been withdrawn. If the objections are resolved within the prescribed time, the department
    of city planning shall forward the petition within five days of such resolution to the council member in whose district the cafe is proposed to be located and to the community board for the community district in which the cafe is proposed to be located,
    and such board shall review the petition pursuant to subdivision e of this section. e. The community board shall, not later than forty-five days after receipt of such petition, either (i) notify the public of the petition in a manner specified by
    the city planning commission, conduct a public hearing thereon and submit a written recommendation to the department and to the council or (ii) waive by a written statement its public hearing and recommendation on such petition, and submit such statement
    to the department and to the council. f. Within thirty days after the expiration of the forty-five day period allowed for the filing of a recommendation or waiver by the community board, the department shall (i) hold a public hearing on the petition,
    (ii) approve the petition, disapprove it or approve it with modifications, and (iii) file with the council any such decision to approve or approve with modifications, together with the petition. If within the time period provided, the department fails
    to take the actions on a petition provided for in the preceding sentence, the petition shall be deemed to have been denied. For a period of not less than fifteen calendar days prior to the date of such public hearing, the petitioner shall post notice
    of the public hearing in a place conspicuous to public view at the location of the proposed sidewalk cafe. At least fifteen days prior to the date of such hearing, the department shall give notice to the community board for the district in which the
    cafe is proposed to be located, to the president of the borough in which the cafe is proposed to be located and to the council member in whose district the cafe is proposed to be located. Not less than five calendar days prior to the date of any such
    hearing, notice of the hearing shall be published in the City Record and in one newspaper of local circulation in the community where the cafe is proposed to be located. No other notice requirements shall apply to hearings for revocable consents for
    sidewalk cafes. g. Within twenty days of the date the petition is received by the council pursuant to subdivision f of this section, the council may resolve by the majority vote of all council members to review the petition. If the council does not
    so resolve, the approval of the petition by the department shall be forwarded to the mayor for approval pursuant to subdivision i of this section. h. If the council resolves to review a petition pursuant to subdivision g of this section, the council
    shall hold a public hearing, after giving public notice not less than five days in advance of such hearing. The council shall take final action on the petition and shall file with the mayor its resolution, if any, with respect to the petition within
    fifty days of the filing of the petition with the council pursuant to subdivision f of this section. The affirmative vote of a majority of all the council members shall be required to approve, approve with modifications or disapprove the petition.
    Any modifications by the council shall not affect the terms of any proposed revocable consent agreement which relate to term, compensation, revocability, exclusivity, security, insurance, indemnification, erection, maintenance or removal of any structure,
    right of access by the city and rights of abutting property owners. If within the time period provided for in this subdivision, the council fails to act or fails to act by the required vote on a petition, the council shall be deemed to have approved
    the petition. i. The consent shall be for such term and upon such conditions as may be provided in the approval of the petition by the department, as such approval may be modified by action of the council pursuant to subdivision h of this section,
    but shall be revocable at any time by the department. The separate and additional approval of the mayor shall be necessary to its validity. j. Consents for sidewalk cafes shall provide for fees to be paid annually to the city during the continuance
    of the consent. Such fees shall be calculated pursuant to a formula established by rule or by local law, which shall apply uniformly to all consents for enclosed sidewalk cafes. The department shall file with the council a written recommendation for
    a formula to be used to calculate such fees.</text>
