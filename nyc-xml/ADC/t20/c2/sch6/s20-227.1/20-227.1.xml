  <text>ยง 20-227.1. a. Any person found to be operating an unlicensed sidewalk cafe shall be liable for a civil penalty of at least two hundred and not more than one thousand dollars for the first violation, at least two hundred and not more than one thousand
    dollars for each additional violation occurring on the same day; and at least five hundred and not more than two thousand dollars for the second violation and each subsequent violation at the same place of business within a two-year period. For purposes
    of this section, any violation for operating an unlicensed sidewalk cafe shall be included in determining the number of violations by any subsequent license holder at the same place of business unless the subsequent license holder provides the department
    with adequate documentation demonstrating that the subsequent license holder acquired the premises or business through an arm's length transaction as defined in subdivision f of this section and that the sale or lease was not conducted, in whole or
    in part, for the purpose of permitting the original license holder to avoid the effect of violations on the premises. b. Any holder of a license found to be operating a sidewalk cafe in violation of this subchapter, the terms and conditions of such
    license and/or a revocable consent or rules promulgated by the commissioner pursuant to this subchapter, shall be liable for a civil penalty of at least two hundred and not more than one thousand dollars for the first violation, at least two hundred
    and not more than one thousand dollars for each additional violation occurring on the same day; and at least five hundred and not more than two thousand dollars for the second violation, and at least one thousand and not more than four thousand dollars
    for each subsequent violation at the same place of business within a two-year period. In addition, for a third violation occurring on a different day and all subsequent violations occurring on different days at the same place of business within a
    two-year period, any person licensed to operate a sidewalk cafe at such place of business shall be subject to suspension or revocation of his or her sidewalk cafe license for such place of business. For purposes of this section, any such violation
    by any license holder at a place of business shall be included in determining the number of violations by any subsequent license holder at the same place of business unless the subsequent license holder provides the department with adequate documentation
    demonstrating that the subsequent license holder acquired the premises or business through an arm's length transaction as defined in subdivision f of this section and that the sale or lease was not conducted, in whole or in part, for the purpose of
    permitting the original license holder to avoid the effect of violations on the premises. A sidewalk cafe license shall be suspended or revoked at the same hearing at which a person is found liable for a third violation or subsequent violations at
    the same place of business within a two-year period. c. A proceeding to recover any civil penalty authorized pursuant to the provisions of subdivisions a or b of this section shall be commenced by service of a notice of violation which shall be returnable
    to the adjudication division of the department. Such notice shall contain a statement that any hearing for a third violation or subsequent violations of this subchapter, the terms and conditions of a license and/or a revocable consent or rules promulgated
    by the commissioner under this subchapter at the same place of business within a two-year period shall also constitute a hearing for the suspension or revocation of a license. d. The penalties provided by subdivisions a and b of this section shall
    be in addition to any other penalty imposed by any other provision of law or rule promulgated thereunder. e. In addition to any other enforcement procedures authorized by this subchapter or any other provision of law or rule, the commissioner after
    notice and a hearing shall be authorized to order that any sidewalk cafe and the restaurant of which it is a portion be sealed for a period not to exceed thirty consecutive days. Such notice may be included with notice of any hearing for a second
    violation for operating an unlicensed sidewalk cafe as provided in subdivision a of this section, or a third violation of this subchapter, the terms and conditions of a license and/or a revocable consent or rules promulgated by the commissioner, as
    provided in subdivision b of this section. For purposes of this subdivision, any such violations at a place of business shall be included in determining the number of violations by any subsequent license holder at the same place of business unless
    the subsequent license holder provides the department with adequate documentation demonstrating that the subsequent license holder acquired the premises or business through an arm's length transaction as defined in subdivision f of this section and
    that the sale or lease was not conducted, in whole or in part, for the purpose of permitting the original license holder to avoid the effect of violations on the premises. The procedures provided for in subdivisions c and e through j of section 20-105
    of this title shall apply to an order by the commissioner for sealing of a sidewalk cafe and the restaurant of which it is a portion. f. For purposes of this section, "arm's length transaction" means a sale of a fee or all undivided interests in real
    property, or lease of any part thereof, or a sale of a business, in good faith and for valuable consideration, that reflects the fair market value of such real property or lease, or business, in the open market, between two informed and willing parties,
    where neither is under any compulsion to participate in the transaction, unaffected by any unusual conditions indicating a reasonable possibility that the sale or lease was made for the purpose of permitting the original licensee to avoid the effect
    of violations on the premises. The following sales or leases shall be presumed not to be arm's length transactions unless adequate documentation is provided demonstrating that the sale or lease was not conducted, in whole or in part, for the purpose
    of permitting the original licensee to avoid the effect of violations on the premises: (1) a sale between relatives; (2) a sale between related companies or partners in a business; or (3) a sale or lease affected by other facts or circumstances that
    would indicate that the sale or lease is entered into for the primary purpose of permitting the original licensee to avoid the effect of violations on the premises, g. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivisions a or b of this section, the suspension
    or revocation of a license for a subsequent offense shall be waived if, upon the submission of satisfactory proof, the commissioner determines that the person or persons who committed the violations which are the basis for the suspension or revocation
    acted against the licensee's will in committing such violations.</text>
