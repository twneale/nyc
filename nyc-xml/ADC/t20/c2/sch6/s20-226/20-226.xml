  <text>§ 20-226 Review and approval of petitions for revocable consents to operate unenclosed sidewalk cafes which do not require special permits. A petition for a revocable consent to operate an unenclosed sidewalk cafe which does not require a special permit
    modification shall be reviewed and approved in the following manner: a. The petition shall be in such form as prescribed by the department. The department shall forward copies of the petition, within five days of the filing of such petition, to the
    speaker of council and the council member in whose district the cafe is proposed to be located, for information purposes, and to the community board for the community district in which the cafe is proposed to be located, for review pursuant to subdivision
    b of this section. b. The community board shall, not later than forty-five days after receipt of such petition, either (i) notify the public of the petition, conduct a public hearing thereon and submit a written recommendation to the department and
    to the council or (ii) waive by a written statement its public hearing and recommendation on such petition and submit such statement to the department and to the council. The petitioner shall amend the petition if both the community board and the
    petitioner agree to modifications in writing. Such modifications shall be reflected in the written recommendations of the community board to the department and the council. c. The department shall hold a public hearing pursuant to subdivision d of
    this section and approve the petition, disapprove it or approve it with modifications within thirty days of the expiration of the forty-five-day period allowed for the filing of a recommendation by the community board. If within the time period provided,
    the department fails to take the actions on a petition provided for in the preceding sentence, the petition shall be deemed to have been denied. Within the thirty-day time period provided for in this subdivision, the department shall file with the
    council any such decision to approve or approve with modifications, together with the petition. d. The department shall hold a public hearing on each petition prior to approving, approving with modifications or disapproving the petition. For a period
    of not less than fifteen calendar days prior to the date of such public hearing, the petitioner shall post notice of the public hearing in a place conspicuous to public view at the location of the proposed sidewalk cafe. At least fifteen days prior
    to the date of the hearing, the department will give notice to the community board for the district in which the cafe is proposed to be located, to the president of the borough in which the cafe is proposed to be located and to the council member
    in whose district the cafe is proposed to be located. Not less than five-calendar days prior to the date of any such hearing, notice of the hearing shall be published in the City Record and in one newspaper of local circulation in the community where
    the cafe is proposed to be located. No other notice requirements shall apply to hearings for revocable consents for sidewalk cafes. e. Within twenty days of the date the petition is received by the council pursuant to subdivision c of this section,
    the council may resolve by majority vote of all the council members to review the petition. If the council does not so resolve, the approval of the petition by the department shall be forwarded to the mayor for approval pursuant to subdivision g of
    this section. f. If the council resolves to review a petition pursuant to subdivision e of this section, the council shall hold a public hearing, after giving public notice not less than five days in advance of such hearing. The council shall take
    final action on the petition and shall file with the mayor its resolution, if any, with respect to the petition within fifty days of the filing of the petition with the council pursuant to subdivision c of this section. The affirmative vote of a majority
    of all the council members shall be required to approve, approve with modifications or disapprove the petition. Any modification by the council shall not affect the terms of any proposed revocable consent agreement which relate to term, compensation,
    revocability, exclusivity, security, insurance, indemnification, erection, maintenance or removal of any structure, right of access by the city and rights of abutting property owners. If within the time period provided for in this subdivision, the
    council fails to act or fails to act by the required vote on a petition, the council shall be deemed to have approved the petition. If within the time period provided for in this subdivision, the council approves the petition with modifications, the
    petitioner shall accept such modifications within fifteen days of such approval, or the council shall be deemed to have denied the petition. g. The consent shall be for such term and upon such conditions as may be provided in the approval of the petition
    by the department, as such approval may be modified by action of the council pursuant to subdivision f of this section, but shall be revocable at any time by the department. The separate and additional approval of the mayor shall be necessary to its
    validity. h. Consents for sidewalk cafes shall provide for fees to be paid annually to the city during the continuance of the consent. Such fees shall be calculated pursuant to a formula established by rule or by local law, which shall apply uniformly
    to all consents for unenclosed sidewalk cafes. The department shall file with the council a written recommendation for a formula to be used to calculate such fees. i. An unenclosed sidewalk cafe may not be opened or operated prior to the approval
    of the consent therefor by the department pursuant to this section.
