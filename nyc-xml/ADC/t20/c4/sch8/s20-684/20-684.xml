  <text>ยง 20-684 Legislative intent. The council finds that consumers cannot be certain that food offered for sale is fresh or that it will remain fresh for a reasonable period of time after it is purchased. The council particularly recognizes consumer concern
    with the freshness of foods including, but not limited to, meat, poultry, fish, dairy products, eggs, fruit, vegetables and baked goods. The council further finds that the food industry's practice of controlling food freshness through coded dates
    has proven inadequate for protection of the public. The council has concluded that a mandatory system of clear and legible dating accompanied by a statement of recommended conditions of storage is the best way to assure consumers of the freshness
    of the foods that they buy in stores.</text>
