  <text>ยง 20-757 Unsolicited offers. Offers for goods or services shall not appear on any invoice for a delayed payment transaction unless the customer has previously agreed to receive such offers. Where the consumer has so agreed, and the item listed is an
    offer, the invoice must state in letters of point size equal to that of the amount to be charged, "This is an offer." No offers shall be included in the total amount due and payable, but must be separately itemized and totalled.</text>
