    to be safe and effective. b. Violations. A person violating section 20-822 of this subchapter shall be guilty of a violation punishable by a fine not to exceed two hundred and fifty dollars for the first violation and a fine not to exceed five hundred
    dollars for any subsequent violation. In addition to such penalties, any person who violates this section shall be liable for a civil penalty of not less than one hundred dollars nor more than two hundred and fifty dollars for the first violation
    and of not less than two hundred and fifty dollars nor more than five hundred dollars for each subsequent violation. For purposes of this subdivision, each group of identical over-the-counter medication subject to this subchapter marked with the same
