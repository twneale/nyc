    (3) disparaging concern for price by suggestion that a customer's concern for price or desire to save money on merchandise or services is improper, inappropriate or indicative of a lack of respect or affection for the deceased, (4) contradicting,
    mitigating or detracting from the printed disclosures required by section 20-732 of this subchapter, or (5) making any claim that is false, misleading or unsubstantiated in a material respect regarding any merchandise or services.</text>
