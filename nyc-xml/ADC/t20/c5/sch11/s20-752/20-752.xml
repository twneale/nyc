  <text>ยง 20-752 Regulations. (a) The commissioner shall promulgate such regulations as shall be necessary to effectuate the purposes of this subchapter, including, but not limited to requirements as to the manner of display of service prices. (b) The commissioner
    may, by regulation, permit a printed list to be substituted for a posted list, in such classes of service establishments in which the commissioner determines that it would be impracticable to post because the list is subject to frequent changes, provided
    that the printed list is given to each customer upon entering the service establishment.
