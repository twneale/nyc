  <text>ยง 16-314 Recycling program revisions. The commissioner shall annually review the recycling program and all rules promulgated thereunder, and shall make the necessary revisions to improve the efficiency of collecting, processing, marketing and selling
    the materials recycled pursuant to this chapter. These revisions may include designating additional recyclable materials. The commissioner shall not delete designated materials without designating additional materials so that the total quantity, by
    weight, of all designated recyclable materials collected, processed, marketed and sold does not decrease. Where the commissioner determines that it is appropriate to delete a designated material, the department shall provide notice of such deletion
    to the mayor and the council, including the reason for such deletion, and shall provide any relevant data supporting such decision.</text>
