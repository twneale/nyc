  <text>ยง 16-462 Rewards. The commissioner shall establish a program to allow individuals to submit a sworn statement affirming the observation of a violation of section 16-461 of this chapter and, where the commissioner deems it appropriate, allow for a reward
    for any such sworn statement. Where a notice of violation or summons is issued for a violation of section 16-461 of this chapter based upon a sworn statement by one or more individuals and where the commissioner determines, in the exercise of his
    or her discretion, that such sworn statement, either alone or in conjunction with the testimony of the person submitting such sworn statement at a civil or criminal proceeding or in a proceeding before the environmental control board, contributes
    to the imposition of a civil or criminal penalty upon any person for a violation of section 16-461 of this chapter, the commissioner shall offer as a reward to such individual or individuals an amount that, in the aggregate, is equal to fifty percent
    of any civil or criminal penalty collected. No peace officer, employee of the department or of the environmental control board, employee of any company under contract with the department, or employee of any governmental entity that, in conjunction
    with the department, conducts enforcement activity relating to a violation of section 16-461 of this chapter, shall be entitled to obtain the benefit of any such reward when acting in the discharge of his or her official duties.
