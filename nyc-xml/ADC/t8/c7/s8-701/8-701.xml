  <text>ยง 8-701 Legislative declaration. Boycotts or blacklists that are based on a person's race, color, creed, age, national origin, alienage or citizenship status, marital status, partnership status, gender, sexual orientation, or disability pose a menace
    to the city's foundation and institutions. In contrast to protests that are in reaction to an unlawful discriminatory practice, connected with a labor dispute or associated with other speech or activities that are protected by the first amendment
    discriminatory boycotts cause havoc, divide the citizenry and do not serve a legitimate purpose. The council declares that discriminatory boycotts are a dangerously insidious form of prejudice and hereby establishes a procedure for expeditiously investigating
    allegations of this type of prejudice, assuring that the council and mayor are duly alerted to the existence of such activity and combating discriminatory boycotts or blacklists.</text>
