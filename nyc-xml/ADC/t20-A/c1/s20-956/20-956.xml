  <text>§ 20-956 Refusal to issue or renew a license or certificate of approval. a. The commission shall refuse to issue or to renew a license to an applicant who has not demonstrated to the commission that he or she possesses good character, honesty and integrity.
    In determining that an applicant has not met his or her burden to demonstrate good character, honesty and integrity, the commission may consider, but is not limited to: (i) knowing failure by such applicant to provide truthful or complete information
    in connection with the application; (ii) a pending indictment or criminal action against such applicant for a crime which under this subdivision would provide a basis for the refusal to issue such license or certificate of approval, or a pending civil
    or administrative action to which such applicant is a party and which directly relates to the fitness to conduct the business or perform the work for which the license or certificate of approval is sought, in which case the commission may defer consideration
    of an application until a decision has been reached by the court or administrative tribunal before which such action is pending; (iii) conviction of such applicant for a crime which, considering the factors set forth in section seven hundred fifty-three
    of the correction law, would provide a basis under such law for the refusal of such license or certificate of approval; (iv) a finding of liability in a civil or administrative action that bears a direct relationship to the fitness of the applicant
    to conduct the business or to perform the employment for which the license or certificate of approval is sought; (v) commission of a racketeering activity or knowing association with a person who has been convicted for a racketeering activity when
    the applicant knew or should have known of such conviction, including but not limited to the offenses listed in subdivision one of section nineteen hundred sixty-one of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations statute (18 U.S.C. § 1961 et
    seq.) or of an offense listed in subdivision one of section 460.10 of the penal law, as such statutes may be amended from time to time, or the equivalent offense under the laws of any other jurisdiction; (vi) conviction of a gambling offense under
    18 U.S.C. § 1081 et seq., 18 U.S.C. §§ 1953 through 1955, article 225 of the penal law or the equivalent offense under the laws of any other jurisdiction; (vii) association with any member or associate of an organized crime group as identified by
    a federal, state or city law enforcement or investigative agency when the applicant knew or should have known of the organized crime associations of such person; (viii) in the case of an applicant business, failure to pay any tax, fine, penalty, fee
    related to the applicant's business for which liability has been admitted by the person liable therefor, or for which judgment has been entered by a court or administrative tribunal of competent jurisdiction and such judgment has not been stayed;
    and (ix) denial of a license or other permission to operate a gambling business or activity in another jurisdiction. For purposes of determining the good character, honesty and integrity of applicants for registration or registrants pursuant to section
    20-955 of this chapter, the term "applicant" as used herein shall be deemed to apply to such applicants for registration or registrants. b. The commission may refuse to issue or to renew a certificate of approval to an applicant who has not demonstrated
    that he or she possesses good character, honesty and integrity. In reaching such a determination, the commission may consider, but is not limited to, the factors set forth in paragraphs (i) through (ix) of subdivision a of this section. c. The commission
    may refuse to issue or to renew a license or certificate of approval to an applicant who has knowingly failed to provide the information and/or documentation required in the form prescribed by the commission pursuant to section 20-954 of this chapter,
    or who has knowingly provided false information or documentation required by the commission pursuant to this chapter or any rules promulgated pursuant hereto. d. The commission may refuse to issue or to renew a license or certificate of approval to
    an applicant when such applicant: (i) was previously issued a license or certificate of approval pursuant to this chapter and such license or certificate of approval was revoked pursuant to the provisions of this chapter; or (ii) has been determined
    to have committed any of the acts which would be a basis for the suspension or revocation of a license or certificate of approval pursuant to this chapter or any rules promulgated hereto. e. The commission may refuse to issue or to renew a license
    pursuant to this chapter to an applicant business where such applicant business or any of the principals of such applicant business have been principals of a licensee whose license has been revoked pursuant to subdivision a of section 20-959 of this
    chapter.</text>
