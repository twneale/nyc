    the commission may by rule determine that registration of a specific category of auxiliary vendor is unnecessary to achieve the purposes of this chapter. The commission shall by rule list the categories of goods and services and/or the amount of sales
    of such goods and services that do not require obtaining a key vendor license or an auxiliary vendor registration and may also, in its discretion, waive a requirement for a key vendor license or auxiliary vendor registration upon a determination that
    such license or registration is unnecessary to achieve the purposes of this chapter. In addition, the commission shall establish, by rule, a procedure whereby a shipboard gambling business may obtain temporary permission, on an expedited basis, to
    purchase goods or services from an unlicensed or unregistered vendor in a situation where such purchase is necessary to the operation of such business. The commission shall make provision for the issuance of licenses pursuant to sections 20-954 and
