    danger to the public health or welfare or the environment, (2) to clean up or remove released hazardous substances from the environment, and (3) which are necessary and appropriate to protect the public health or welfare or the environment from an

    operator, lessee, occupant or tenant, other than a residential lessee, occupant or tenant, of property at the time there is a release, or a substantial threat of a release, of a hazardous substance from such property into the environment or at the
    time of any response measures implemented in connection with any emergency involving such release or threat of release, provided that if such property is comprised of an owner-occupied residential building consisting of six or fewer dwelling units
    used exclusively for residential purposes, an owner of such property shall be deemed to be a "responsible person" for purposes of this paragraph, only if the willful, knowing, reckless or negligent acts or omissions of such owner caused or substantially
    contributed to such release or threat of release, and further provided that a federal or state chartered and regulated financial institution which has received title to the property through abandonment, foreclosure, a deed in lieu of foreclosure,
    or through a judicial or bankruptcy order shall not be deemed to be a "responsible person" for purposes of this paragraph, unless (i) willful, knowing, reckless or negligent acts or omissions of such person caused or substantially contributed to such
    release or threat of release, or (ii) the title was received in order to secure the underlying credit extension which had been entered into for the purpose of assisting the responsible person in avoidance of the provisions of this chapter, or (2)

    of a hazardous substance into the environment from property used for residential purposes, a person using such property as a residence and any invitee or licensee of such person who enters such property, other than an invitee or licensee engaged in
    a business involving the use or transport of any hazardous substance, shall be deemed to be a "responsible person" for purposes of this paragraph, only if the willful, knowing, reckless or negligent acts or omissions of such person or invitee caused
    or substantially contributed to such release or threat of release, or (3) any owner, operator, lessee, occupant or tenant of the property at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance thereon, who had caused, authorized or permitted such hazardous

    provided, however, that no person, who is an entity independent from an otherwise responsible person, authorized by the commissioner of environmental protection to implement response measures at the site of a release, or a threat of a release, of
    a hazardous substance into the environment, shall be deemed to be a "responsible person" solely on the basis of any authorized response measures attempted or implemented by such person at such site, unless such person's willful, knowing, reckless
    or negligent acts or omissions caused or substantially contributed to a release, or a substantial threat of a release, of a hazardous substance into the environment. h. "treatment" means any method, technique, or process, including neutralization,
    designed to change the physical, chemical, or biological character or composition of any hazardous substance so as to neutralize such substance or so as to render such substance nonhazardous, safer for transport, amenable for recovery, amenable for
