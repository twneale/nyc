    section 24-264 of this code: (1) Order the commissioner to revoke or suspend a certificate or tunneling permit issued pursuant to this code for any device or activity where such device or activity causes, or is maintained or operated so as to cause

    subdivision (c) of this section; (4) Order any person to cease and desist from any activity which causes or is conducted so as to cause a violation of any provision of this code or any order or regulation promulgated by the commissioner or the board,

    of the premises with respect to which the violation occurred, at the same premises (all violations committed within two years). ________________________________________________________________________ Each day during which such violation continues
    shall constitute a separate violation. The board may remit, in whole or in part, such a civil penalty if, at the conclusion of the hearing or at the time of the board determination under section 24-266 of this code, the respondent is no longer in
    violation of a provision of this code, or of any order, rule or regulation promulgated by the commissioner or the board; (6) Impose a civil penalty of not more than two hundred fifty dollars on any owner of a device for each day such equipment is
    sealed pursuant to this section; (7) Impose a civil penalty of not less than one thousand nor more than four thousand dollars on any person who willfully breaks, or causes or permits the breaking of, a seal placed on a device pursuant to this section.
    (8) Impose an additional civil penalty in the amount of twenty-five percent of that which would otherwise be imposed for each twelve decibels by which the sound or noise level measured exceeds the maximum sound level as contained in subchapters five
    and six of this chapter. (9) Impose an additional civil penalty in the amount of ten percent of the penalty originally imposed, for late payment of penalty for each month, or part thereof, that the penalty payment is in arrears. In no event shall
    the total additional civil penalty exceed the maximum set forth in the table of civil penalties, or as modified pursuant to paragraph eight of this subdivision or paragraph ten of this subdivision, or both. (10) Order any person to be classified as
    a persistent violator if such person is found to be in violation of this code and has also on one or more prior occasions within the preceding five years been found to be in violation of this code, where such repeated violations evidence substanial
    disregard thereof. If a person is classified as a persistent violator, the board shall in each instance double the amount of the penalty which it would otherwise impose pursuant to paragraph five of this subdivision. Such double penalties shall be
    imposed for violations which the board finds a person committed pursuant to the same proceeding at which it classified such person as a persistent violator and for all violations committed within two years immediately following such classification,
    after which such classification shall terminate. However, if at the end of such two year period such person is still in violation of this code because of a failure to take or complete a corrective action as required by the board, such classification
    shall continue until such time as such person is no longer in violation of this code because of such failure, at which time such classification shall cease. Thereafter, the board may again classify such person as a persistent violator, on the same
    basis it used originally. (c) The board may, upon notice pursuant to section 24-259 of this code: (1) order any person to cease and desist from the operation of any listed device without a certificate as required by section 24-245 of this code and
    the board may also seal such device; (2) order any person to cease and desist from tunneling without a tunneling permit as required by section 24-245 of this code and the board may also seal any device used in such tunneling; (3) order any person
    not in possession of an after hours work authorization issued pursuant to section 24-223 of this code to cease and desist from construction activities other than during the permissible hours specified in section 24-222 of this code and the board may
    also seal any device used in such construction activities; (4) order any person to cease and desist from the operation of a device without registration required by section 24-208 of this code and the board may also seal such device. (d) The board
    may order the commissioner to install any apparatus or to repair or alter any device or apparatus which causes or is maintained or operated so as to cause a violation of an order issued pursuant to paragraph two of subdivision (b) of this section,
    where such repairing or alteration can reasonably be expected to correct such a violation. Any work required under such an order may be executed by the commissioner through the officers, agents or contractors of the department. The department shall
    be reimbursed promptly for all costs and expenses of such work by the owner of the device to which the order relates and in respect to which such expenses were incurred. Such expenses may be recovered in a civil action brought in the name of the commissioner.
    (e) If an order of the board issued pursuant to subdivisions (b) and (c) of this section provides for a period of time during which a person subject to the order is permitted to correct a violation, the board may require the respondent to post a performance
    bond or other security with the department in a form and amount sufficient to assure the correction of such violation within the prescribed time. In the event of a failure to meet the schedule prescribed by the board, the sum named in the bond or
    other security shall be forfeited and shall be paid to the commissioner. (f) (1) The board may order any person to cease and desist from an activity which it reasonably believes causes unreasonable noise which creates imminent peril to the public
    health and well being, or to cease and desist from an activity which it reasonably believes constitutes a wilful or continued violation of any provision of this code or order or regulation, promulgated by the commissioner or board. Such order shall
    be effective upon service thereof. Any party affected by such an order may request a hearing on written notice, and he or she shall be afforded a hearing, within twenty-four hours after service of such request, pursuant to section 24-263 of this code.
    If such an accelerated hearing is not requested, then a hearing shall be afforded within ten days of the issuance of the order. The board shall issue its final decision and order thereon within three days from the conclusion of a hearing held pursuant
    to this subdivision.</text>
