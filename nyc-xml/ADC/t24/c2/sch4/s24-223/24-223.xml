  <text>ยง 24-223 After hours work authorization. (a) Notwithstanding section 24-222 of this subchapter, an agency authorized to issue permits for construction work may, along with such permit, issue an after hours work authorization for the work site. Such
    after hours authorization may permit construction work to be performed at the site before 7 a.m. or after 6 p.m. on weekdays and/or on Saturdays and/or Sundays subject to the conditions and restrictions set forth in this section. (b) The agency issuing
    such authorization must obtain a certification from its permittee that the permittee has developed a noise mitigation plan for the site in accordance with this subchapter and that such plan is in compliance with the noise mitigation rules. In the
    case of emergency work such certification shall be submitted within 3 days after the commencement of the work. (c) If after hours work at the site is not being performed in compliance with such plan or where no plan is in effect, the department or
    the agency issuing such authorization, at the request of the commissioner or on its own account, may take appropriate action, including but not limited to the refusal to renew such after hours authorization. (d) Where there is full compliance with
    the noise mitigation plan yet nevertheless aggregate sound levels from the site where an after hours authorization is in effect exceed 8dB(A) above the ambient sound level as measured in any residential receiving property dwelling unit (with windows
    and doors that may affect the measurement closed), the commissioner may request the person performing the work to confer with representatives of the department regarding additional noise mitigation measures that may be employed at the site to reduce
    aggregate sound levels. After such conference the commissioner may direct amendment of the noise mitigation plan for the site. Failure to respond to a request for a conference or to amend the noise mitigation plan within the time prescribed in a notice
    issued by the department shall be a violation of this code. (e) Authorization for after hours construction work may only be issued in the following circumstances: (1) Emergency work. Agencies shall authorize such after hours construction work for
    emergency conditions, inside or outside the property line, involving a threat to public safety or causing or likely to cause the imminent interruption of service required by law, contract or franchise. An emergency authorization issued pursuant to
    this paragraph shall expire as determined by the agency but no later than the ninetieth day after its issuance and shall be renewable in accordance with agency procedures while the emergency continues. (2) Public safety. Agencies may authorize such
    after hours work, inside or outside of the property line, where the agency determines that the work cannot reasonably or practicably be performed on weekdays between the hours of 7 a.m. and 6 p.m. because of traffic congestion and/or concern for worker
    and/or public safety. An authorization issued pursuant to this paragraph shall expire as determined by the agency but no later than the ninetieth day after its issuance and shall be renewable in accordance with agency procedures. (3) City construction
    projects. Agencies may authorize after hours work by or on behalf of city agencies for projects that are judicially mandated or the subject of consent orders and/or where a project is necessary in the public interest including but not limited to facilities,
    equipment, and infrastructure for the provision of water, sewerage, sanitation, transportation and other services necessary for the health or safety of the public. An authorization issued pursuant to this paragraph for a city construction project
    shall remain in effect for the duration of the project. (4) Construction activities with minimal noise impact. The commissioner shall promulgate rules setting forth a list of construction activities with minimal noise impact and specific noise mitigation
    measures applicable to such activities. Agencies may authorize the performance of such construction activities after hours in accordance with such rules. (5) Undue hardship. Agencies may authorize after hours work if the commissioner certifies that
    the permit holder has substantiated a claim of undue hardship resulting from unique site characteristics, unforeseen conditions, scheduling commitments and/or financial considerations outside the control of the permit holder and that the applicant
    has received approval from the department of an alternative noise mitigation plan pursuant to section 24-221 of this subchapter, specifying the activities and devices that will be used for such after hours construction and setting forth the additional
    mitigation measures, above and beyond those measures otherwise required for such devices and activities pursuant to the department's rules, that the applicant will use to significantly limit noise emissions from the site of such after hours work.
    Applications for such certification shall be submitted to the department in a form and manner to be set forth in the rules of the department. The applicant for an after hours authorization under this paragraph shall submit such certification to the
    issuing agency.</text>
