    and such rules whenever any one or more of the construction devices or activities listed above or in the department's rules are employed or performed at the site. (b) Such plan shall be adopted prior to the commencement of construction at the site
    or, with respect to emergency work, as defined in the department's rules, within three days thereafter, and shall apply to all work at the site throughout the construction process. The plan shall provide in detail the noise mitigation strategies,
    methods, procedures and technology, as prescribed in the rules of the department or specifically approved by the commissioner in accordance with section 24-221 of this code, for each device or activity employed or performed at the site. Each permit

    filed with or approved by the department prior to the commencement of construction if it conforms in all respects to the rules of the department with respect to construction devices and activities employed or performed at the construction site. A
    plan that deviates in any respect from such rules or an alternative noise mitigation plan required to be certified in conjunction with a undue hardship application pursuant to paragraph (5) of subdivision (e) of section 24-223 shall be subject to
    the prior approval of the commissioner in accordance with section 24-221 of this code. (f) This section shall not apply to construction work in connection with the alteration or repair of an existing one or two family owner-occupied dwelling classified
