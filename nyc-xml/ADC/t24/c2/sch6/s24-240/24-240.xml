  <text>ยง 24-240 Removal of vehicle with audible burglar alarm or audible status indicator. (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 24-239, any member of the police department may arrange for the removal of a motor vehicle from a public highway or parking
    lot open to the public, when: (i) an audible burglar alarm installed on such vehicle is operated in violation of this code or an audible status indicator is operated on such vehicle; and (ii) all reasonable and necessary steps to disconnect such alarm
    or audible status indicator have been taken without success. Authorized personnel of the department or the department of transportation may request a member of the police department to arrange for removal of such vehicle. When such removal is requested,
    the notice of violation for operation of an audible burglar alarm in violation of this section or for operation of an audible status indicator shall state that a member of the police department took all reasonable and necessary steps to disconnect
    such alarm or such audible status indicator without success. Such removal may be accomplished by utilizing any existing city-operated tow-program, rotation tow program established pursuant to section 20-519 of the code or such other procedures as
    may be established. The cost of towing and storage of such motor vehicle shall be the responsibility of the owner or other person who claims such vehicle. (b) An opportunity for a hearing before the board shall be provided to the owner of a motor
    vehicle removed pursuant to this section within five business days after a request for a hearing is made to determine whether there was a basis for such removal. The board shall render a decision within two business days following the conclusion of
    the hearing. If it is determined that there was no basis for removal of a vehicle pursuant to this section, the owner of such vehicle may recover from the city any amounts paid by such owner for towing and storage.</text>
