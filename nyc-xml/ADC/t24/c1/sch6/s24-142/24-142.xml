  <text>ยง 24-142 Emission of air contaminant; standard smoke chart. (a) No person shall cause or permit the emission of air contaminant of: (1) A density which appears as dark or darker than number two on the standard smoke chart or of an opacity which obscures
    vision to a degree equal to or greater than smoke of number two density on the standard smoke chart; or (2) A density which appears as dark or darker than number one on the standard smoke chart, but less than number two on said chart, or of such opacity
    as to obscure vision to a degree equal to or greater than smoke of number one density on the standard smoke chart, but less than number two on said chart, if such an emission continues for longer than two minutes in the aggregate in any sixty minute
    period. (b) The density or opacity of an air contaminant shall be measured at the point of its emission, except: (1) When the point of emission cannot be readily observed, it may be measured at an observable point on the plume nearest the point of
    emission; or (2) In the case of air contaminant emitted from a source outside of New York, it shall be measured after the plume crosses the jurisdictional boundary of New York city.</text>
