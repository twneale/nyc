  <heading>Emissions of air contaminant; environmental ratings.</heading>
  <text>ยง 24-153 Emissions of air contaminant; environmental ratings. No person shall cause, permit or allow the emission of air contaminant from any equipment altered or installed after August twentieth, nineteen hundred seventy-one, which exceeds the permissible
    emission rates specified in figures one, two, three, four and five, for the environmental rating as determined in accordance with table one of this section. (a) On October first, nineteen hundred seventy-one, or such later date as established by an
    order of the commissioner the permissible emission rates specified in this section shall become applicable to equipment in existence on or prior to August twentieth, nineteen hundred seventy-one. (b) The provisions of this section shall not be construed
    to allow or permit any person to emit air contaminant in quantities which alone or in combination with other sources would contravene any air quality standards. (c) This section shall be supplemental to all other provisions of this code and in the
    event of conflict the more stringent section shall control. TABLE 1 - Environmental Rating Criteria Rating A. Includes processes, and exhaust and ventilation systems where the discharge of air contaminant results, or would reasonably be expected to
    result, in serious adverse effects on receptors or the environment. These effects may be of a health, economic or aesthetic nature or any combination of these. B. Includes processes, and exhaust and ventilation systems where the discharge of contaminant
    results, or would reasonably be expected to result, in only moderate and essentially localized effects; or where the multiplicity of sources of the contaminant in any given area is such as to require an overall reduction of the atmospheric burden
    of that contaminant. C. Includes processes, and exhaust and ventilation systems where the discharge of contaminant would reasonably be expected to result in localized adverse effects of an aesthetic or nuisance nature. D. Includes processes, and exhaust
    and ventilation systems where, in view of properties and concentrations of the emissions, isolated conditions, stack heights, and other factors, it can be clearly demonstrated that discharge of contaminant will not result in measurable or observable
    effects on receptors and not add to an existing or predictable atmospheric burden of that contaminant which would reasonably be expected to cause adverse effects. The following items will be considered in making a determination of the environmental
    rating to be applied to a particular source: (a) properties, quantities and rates of the emissions; (b) physical surroundings of emission source; (c) population density of surrounding area, including anticipated future growth; (d) dispersion characteristics
    at or near source; (e) location of emission source relative to ground level and surrounding buildings, hills, and other features of the terrain; (f) current or anticipated ambient air quality in vicinity of source; (g) latest findings relating to
    effects of ground-level concentrations of the emissions on receptors; (h) possible hazardous side effects of air contaminant in question mixing with air contaminants already in ambient air; and (i) engineering guides which are acceptable to the commissioner.

    for environmental rating B,C and D. *** Degree of air cleaning may be specified by the commissioner providing satisfactory dispersion is achieved. (1) Where multiple emission sources are connected to a common air cleaning device, the degree of air
    cleaning required will be that which would be required if each individual emission source were considered separately. (2) For an average emission rate potential less than 1.0 lb./hr., the desired air cleaning efficiency shall be determined by the
    expected concentration of the air contaminant in the emission stream. Where it is uneconomical to employ air cleaning devices, other methods of control should be considered.</text>
