    sulfur compounds of more than five hundred parts per million of undiluted process emissions; (b) from a boiler with a capacity of five hundred million Btu per hour or more and completed after August twentieth, nineteen hundred seventy-one, if the
    air contaminant emitted has a sulfur dioxide content of more than one hundred parts per million by volume of undiluted emissions measured at ten percent excess air; (c) from a boiler with a capacity of five hundred million Btu per hour or more and
    completed before August twentieth, nineteen hundred seventy-one, if the air contaminant emitted has a sulfur dioxide content of more than two hundred parts per million by volume of undiluted emissions measured at ten percent excess air.</text>
