    schedule for his or her approval by the owner of the equipment. (b) Whenever the emission of an air contaminant, which emission constitutes a violation of any provision of this code, occurs as a result of, malfunction, breakdown or removal from service
    of equipment or apparatus, the owner of the equipment from which the emission of an air contaminant occurs shall report the emission of the air contaminant and its attendant circumstances to the commissioner not later than thirty minutes from its
    discovery. The report shall be confirmed in writing, in a form prescribed by the commissioner not later than three days thereafter. (c) An owner of such equipment shall not continue it in operation during any malfunction, breakdown, or shutdown of
    the equipment or of the apparatus which serves the equipment, except with the express permission of the commissioner. Such permission shall be given only as may be necessary to protect the public health and safety. This subdivision shall not apply

    commercial services that may incidentally involve the storage of limited quantities of stocks of goods for office use or purposes. (e) Whenever the commissioner shall determine that equipment, for which a certificate of operation is required by this
    code, may emit or be capable of emitting dangerous or odorous air contaminants, either as a result of a malfunction or breakdown of such equipment or as a result of a malfunction or breakdown of the apparatus which serves such equipment, the commissioner
    may require the owner of such equipment to file with the department an acceptable emergency action plan. The emergency action plan shall detail all activity that will be taken to prevent or control emissions resulting from a malfunction or breakdown.</text>
