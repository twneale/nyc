    means technology, verified by the United States environmental protection agency or the California air resources board unless as otherwise deemed appropriate by the commissioner for a nonroad vehicle, for reducing the emission of pollutants that achieves
    reductions in particulate matter emissions at the highest classification level for diesel emission control strategies, as set forth in subdivision d of this section, that is applicable to the particular engine and application. Such technology shall
    also, at a reasonable cost, achieve the greatest reduction in emissions of nitrogen oxides at such particulate matter reduction level and shall in no event result in a net increase in the emissions of either particulate matter or nitrogen oxides.
    (2) "City agency" means a city, county, borough, administration, department, division, bureau, board or commission, or a corporation, institution or agency of government, the expenses of which are paid in whole or in part from the city treasury. (3)
    "Contractor" means any person or entity that enters into a solid waste contract or recyclable materials contract with a city agency, or any person or entity that enters into an agreement with such person or entity, to perform work or provide labor
    or services related to such solid waste contract or recyclable materials contract. (4) "Motor vehicle" shall mean a vehicle operated or driven upon a public highway which is propelled by any power other than muscular power, except electrically-driven
    mobility assistance devices operated or driven by a person with a disability. (5) "Nonroad engine" means an internal combustion engine (including the fuel system) that is not used in a motor vehicle or a vehicle used solely for competition, or that
    is not subject to standards promulgated under section 7411 or section 7521 of title 42 of the United States code, except that this term shall apply to internal combustion engines used to power generators, compressors or similar equipment used in the
    fulfillment of any solid waste contract or recyclable materials contract. (6) "Nonroad vehicle" means a vehicle that is powered by a nonroad engine, fifty horsepower and greater, and that is not a motor vehicle or a vehicle used solely for competition,
