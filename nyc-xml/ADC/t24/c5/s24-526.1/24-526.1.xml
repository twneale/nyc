  <text>ยง 24-526.1 Sustainable stormwater management. a. Definitions. For the purposes of this section only, the following terms shall have the following meanings: 1. "Best Management Practices" or "BMPs" mean source control measures. 2. "Bioretention" means
    using living vegetative systems to capture, store, and cleanse stormwater. Bioretention may be achieved by, among other things, rain gardens, vegetated buffers, swales, and medians. 3. "Bluebelt" means engineered and natural aquatic systems, such
    as existing wetlands, streams and ponds, that control the movement of water and prevent flooding, as an alternative to constructing storm sewers. 4. "Blueroof" means a rooftop detention system. 5. "Cisterns" means storage tanks that are used to capture
    and store rainwater and other precipitation. 6. "City" means the city of New York. 7. "Downspout disconnections" means disconnecting downspouts from the sewer system, such that water from downspouts drains into bioretention devices, cisterns, or other
    stormwater control devices. 8. "Green roof" means a living vegetative system partially or wholly covering a roof. 9. "Green street" means a street that incorporates environmentally beneficial engineering techniques into its design, including vegetative
    source control measures. 10. "Green wall" means a living vegetative system partially or wholly covering a wall. 11. "Grey-water reuse" means reuse of wastewater for beneficial purposes such as irrigation. 12. "High level storm sewer" means a storm
    sewer in which the catch basin connection is removed from the combined sewer under streets or in the public right-of-way and connected to a new storm sewer that will convey stormwater directly to ambient surface waters. As a general matter this type
    of separation is also called "partial separation." 13. "Loading" means an amount of matter that is introduced into a receiving waterbody. 14. "Non-technological measure" or "non-technological source control measure" means a source control measure
    that does not use technology to control stormwater, such as operational strategies, procedural changes to design and construction protocols, or performance standards. 15. "Office" shall mean such office or agency as the mayor shall designate. 16.
    "Permeable pavement" means any area paved with material that permits water penetration into a suitably designed discharge bed. Permeable pavement may consist of any porous surface materials that are installed, laid, or poured. 17. "Pollution loading"
    means an amount of pollutants that is introduced into a receiving waterbody. 18. "Rain barrel" means a barrel used to hold rainwater. 19. "Source control measure" means any stormwater management practice designed to reduce and/or slow the flow of
    stormwater into a combined sanitary and stormwater sewer or a separate stormwater sewer, including, but not limited to, any such practices commonly referred to as "Low Impact Development" or "Best Management Practices." 20. "Subgrade storage chambers"
    means underground stormwater storage facilities that are designed to hold stormwater to prevent such water from entering combined or other sewer systems. 21. "Technological measure" or "technological source control measure" means a source control
    measure that uses a technology to control stormwater, such as rooftop detention or a constructed bioswale. 22. "Tree cover" means the extent to which an area is covered by the canopy of living trees. 23. "Tree pit design" means the specifications
    according to which space is created for the planting of trees in paved areas, including but not limited to the depth and breadth of the planting area, the type of soil, and the type of barrier, if any, constructed around the perimeter of the planting
    area. 24. "Vegetative source control measure" means a source control measure that relies on living vegetative systems to reduce and/or slow the flow of stormwater into a combined sanitary and stormwater sewer or a separate stormwater sewer. 25. "Waterbody
    means any river, tidal estuary, bay, creek, canal, or other body of surface water. b. Development of sustainable stormwater management plan. 1. The office shall develop a proposed and final sustainable stormwater management plan. Such plan shall identify
    and provide for the implementation throughout the city, on both public and private properties, of efficient, effective, and feasible technological and non-technological source control measures to reduce the volume of water flowing into the city's
    sewer system and the pollution loadings carried by stormwater into the city's waterbodies. The overall goals of such plan shall be to reduce the volume of stormwater flowing into the city's sewer system, to improve water quality in the city's waterbodies
    and to protect the public health through the restoration and protection of the ecological health of the city's waterbodies, and to enhance use and enjoyment of the city's waterbodies for recreational activities. 2. No later than October 1, 2008, the
    office shall submit a draft sustainable stormwater management plan that meets the requirements of this section to the mayor, speaker of the council, and the public for review and comment. Submission to the public may be made by posting a draft plan
    on the internet. 3. Two months after the release of the draft plan, but no later than December 1, 2008, the office shall submit a final sustainable stormwater management plan that meets the requirements of this section to the mayor, speaker of the
    council, and the public. Such plan shall be reviewed and revised by the office as necessary to achieve such plan's goals; provided that such review must occur at least once every four years. Any such revisions and the reasons for such revisions should
    be clearly indicated in such plan. 4. No later than October 1, 2010, and no later than October 1 of every second year thereafter, the office shall submit a report to the mayor, the speaker of the council, and the public, which shall include, but not
