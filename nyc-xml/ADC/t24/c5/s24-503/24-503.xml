    sewer and drain proposed for each of such districts; 2. The contemplated depth of such sewers and drains below the present surface and below the established grades of streets and avenues; 3. The proposed alterations and improvements in existing sewers;
    4. Such other particulars as may be necessary for the purpose of exhibiting a complete plan of the proposed sewerage therein. b. Such plan shall indicate the location and size of all sewage disposal works or plants, and the necessary appurtenances
    thereto, as determined by the department of environmental protection. c. The commissioner of environmental protection shall submit such map or plan simultaneously to the department of health and mental hygiene, the director of city planning, each

    shall review and determine the conformance of such map or plan with the city map, as adopted. Upon determination that such map or plan conforms with the city map, such director shall certify such determination to the commissioner of environmental
    protection. Unless the director shall file a statement with such commissioner in relation to such map or plan within thirty days subsequent to the submission of said map or plan, such map or plan shall be deemed to conform with the city map and shall
