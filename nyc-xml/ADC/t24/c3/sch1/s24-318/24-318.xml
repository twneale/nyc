  <text>ยง 24-318 Validity of lien; grounds for challenge. a. In any proceedings to enforce or discharge a lien created pursuant to section 24-317 of this subchapter, the validity of the lien shall not be subject to challenge based on: (1) The lawfulness of
    the work done; or (2) The propriety and accuracy of the items of expenses for which a lien is claimed, except as provided in this section. b. No such challenge may be made except by (1) the owner of the property, or (2) a mortagee or lienor whose
    mortgage or lien would, but for the provisions of section 24-317 of this subchapter, have priority over the department's lien.</text>
