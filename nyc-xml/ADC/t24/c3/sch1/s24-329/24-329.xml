  <text>ยง 24-329 Interments near reservoir prohibited. It shall be unlawful to establish any cemetery or place of burial, or burial vaults, or other place for the reception or burial of dead bodies, or to bury, or deposit in vaults, any dead body, within a
    distance of half a mile of any reservoir, or any ponds used for the supply of the borough of Brooklyn with water. In the county of Nassau, however, it shall be lawful to do so with the written consent of the state department of health and the commissioner
    of environmental protection upon such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by such commissioner. This section shall not, however, be construed to prevent burials in any cemetery already established, or grounds now held by any religious corporation
    or society organized under the laws of this state.</text>
