  <text>ยง 24-343 Transfer of house service pipe connection to new water main. a. In instances where the city has laid a water main in a street where surface grades have been established but where the surface has not been improved to the established grade and
    when a new water main is installed by the city because it is required by the grading of such street to the established grade, the commissioner of environmental protection shall issue an order directing the owner of each house which was directly connected
    with the main as previously laid, to transfer the house service pipe connection to the new main, at the expense of such owner when required in accordance with the rules and regulations of the commissioner. b. When a new water main is installed by
    the city to replace a private main, the commissioner shall issue an order directing the owner of each house fronting on the city main and receiving water from such private main to transfer the house service pipe connection to the city main, at the
    expense of such owner and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the commissioner. c. An order issued pursuant to this section shall be served upon the owner of the premises, by registered mail sent to the address registered by such owner
    in the bureau of city collections in the department of finance, or if no address is registered in such bureau, by registered mail sent to the last known address of such owner, or to the address of such owner as shown on the records in the office where
    conveyances of real property are recorded pursuant to law. d. If the transfer is not made within ten days after the mailing of such order, the department of environmental protection may make such transfer through its officers, agents or contractors.
    The owner shall be personally liable for the expenses and disbursements incurred by the department in making such transfer. The amount of such expenses and disbursements shall be due and payable when definitely fixed by the commissioner of environmental
    protection and entered upon the records in the office of the city collector. A notice stating the amount due and the nature of the charge shall be mailed by the city collector within five days after such entry to the address registered by such owner
    in the bureau of city collections in the department of finance, or if no address is registered in such bureau, to the last known address of the owner of such property or to the address of such owner as shown on the records in the office where conveyances
    of real property are recorded pursuant to law. If such amount is not paid on or before the last day of the month following the month of entry, it shall be the duty of the city collector to charge, collect and receive interest thereon at the rate of
    seven per cent per annum to be calculated to the date of payment from the date of entry. The amount of such expenses and disbursements and the interest thereon shall be a lien upon the premises for which the transfer of the house service pipe connection
    was made, and shall be enforced and collected in the manner provided in chapter three of title eleven of this code for the enforcement and collection of water rents and the lien thereof.</text>
