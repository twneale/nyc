  <text>ยง 24-322 Special water service for fire, sanitary and other purposes. a. The board of estimate may make and enter into contracts and agreements for a term of years with any corporation duly organized under the laws of this state, for the furnishing
    of a special water service for fire, sanitary and other purposes, and for supplying water suitable therefor from any source with a pressure equal to a head of three hundred feet above tide water. Such contracts and agreements shall contain such conditions,
    provisions and stipulations as such board may consider necessary and proper in the interests of the city, and shall be upon such terms as it deems best. Such board, by such contract, may authorize such corporation to lay down pipes and erect hydrants
    in the streets of the city, under such restrictions and conditions as may be prescribed by such board. b. Such contracts or agreements may also provide for the purchase by the city of all the rights and property secured by such corporation and the
    works constructed by them for furnishing water for such special purposes, when such board of estimate shall deem such purchase to be for the interest of the city. Such purchase, however, must be determined upon by such board at the expiration of five
    years from the date of the contract. The cost of such purchase shall be determined by arbitrators appointed by the supreme court. c. This section and all contracts or agreements executed under its provisions, shall be construed so as not to interfere
    with, hinder or delay the construction and use of any works now or hereafter authorized by law, relating to procuring an increased supply of water from the Croton aqueduct system of the city.</text>
