    a house control valve, a building or other enclosure or a point at which the water supply is fully metered. b. When a test made by the department of environmental protection indicates that there is a leak at a tap or in a service pipe, if conditions
    permit, a notice shall be served by a representative of such department upon the owner or occupant of the premises being supplied by such tap or service pipe. The notice shall direct that all necessary repairs be made to stop the leak. c. In the event
    that a tap is shut off by the department because of a leak, the owner or occupant of the affected premises shall be notified that the tap has been closed and that a licensed plumber should be engaged to make the necessary repair and take charge of
    the street excavation. If the owner or occupant fails within three days after notice, excepting emergencies as determined by the commissioner to engage a licensed plumber, the tap shall remain closed and the department of environmental protection
