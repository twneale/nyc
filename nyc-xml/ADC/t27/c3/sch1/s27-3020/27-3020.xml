  <text>ยง 27-3020 Supplying or discontinuing electrical energy. a. Except as otherwise provided in this code, no person, partnership or corporation shall supply, or cause to be supplied or used, electrical energy for light, heat or power, signaling, alarm or
    data transmission to any wiring or appliance in any building unless a sign-off or other authorization as set forth in the rules of the department authorizing the use of said wiring or appliance shall have been issued by the commissioner. b. If, in
    the judgment of the commissioner, after due inspection, the continued use of any electric wiring or appliances in or on any building or structure shall be unsafe or dangerous to persons or property, the commissioner may cause such wires or appliances
    to be disconnected from the supply of electrical energy and to seal the wiring and appliances so disconnected. Thereafter, no person shall cause or permit electrical energy to be supplied to the wiring or appliances so sealed until the same shall
    have been made safe and the commissioner shall have issued a certificate to that effect; provided, however, that no wiring or appliances shall be disconnected pursuant to this section until a notice in writing, stating specifically the reason why
    such wiring or appliances must be disconnected, shall have been served, as provided in this chapter, and a duplicate thereof shall have been delivered to the person supplying the electrical energy to such wiring or appliances.</text>
