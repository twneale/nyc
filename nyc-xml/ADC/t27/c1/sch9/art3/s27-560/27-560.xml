  <text>§ 27-560 Stage areas using scenery or scenic elements. Scenery battens and suspension systems shall be designed for a load of thirty pounds per linear foot of batten length. Loft block and head block beams shall be designed to support vertical and horizontal
    loads corresponding to a four inch spacing of battens for the entire depth of the gridiron. Direction and magnitude of total forces shall be determined from the geometry of the rigging system including load concentrations from spot line rigging. Locking
    rails shall be designed for a uniform uplift of five hundred psf with a one thousand pound concentration. Impact factor for batten design shall be seventy-five per cent and for loft and head block beams shall be twenty-five per cent. A plan drawn
    to a scale not less than one-quarter inch equals one foot shall be displayed in the stage area indicating the framing plan of the rigging loft and the design loads for all members used to support scenery or rigging. Gridirons over stages shall be
    designed to support a uniformly distributed live load of fifty psf in addition to the rigging loads indicated.
