  <text>ยง 27-563 Partial loading conditions. (a) Uniformly distributed loads. In continuous framing and cantilever construction, the design shall consider live load on all spans and arrangements of partial live load that will produce maximum stresses in the
    supporting members. The simplifications given in paragraphs one through three of this subdivision are permissible. (1) FLOOR AND ROOF FRAMING. a. For vertical live load applied to the level under consideration, the far ends of the columns above and
    below that level may be assured as fixed. b. Combinations of live load may be limited to the following: 1. Live load placed on two adjacent spans. 2. Live load placed on alternate spans. The effects of live load on spans more than two spans away from
    the span under consideration may be neglected. (2) ARCHES AND GABLED FRAMES. a. Live load placed on 1/2 span adjacent to one support. b. Live load placed on the center 1/4 span. c. Live load placed on 3/8 the span adjacent to each support. (3) COLUMNS.
    Moments due to vertical loads may be calculated from the live load on the largest single adjacent span of the floor under consideration. This moment shall be assumed to act concurrently with live load on all other floors. (b) Moving concentrated loads.
    Structural members supporting moving concentrated loads shall be designed for only those loads that can physically occur simultaneously and are arranged to produce maximum stresses.
