  <text>ยง 27-561 Roof loads. Roofs and marquees shall be designed for wind, live, and other loads as prescribed in subdivisions (a) through (d) of this section. It may be assumed that maximum wind load occurs with zero live load and that maximum live load occurs
    with zero wind load. For dwellings an exception is made for awnings, canopies, and patio covers, which may be designed for a live load of twenty psf of horizontal projection. (a) Live load. Minimum design live loads shall be as follows: (1) For roofs
    with slopes up to and including twenty degrees from the horizontal, thirty psf of horizontal projection. (2) For roofs with slopes greater than twenty degrees from the horizontal, thirty psf of horizontal projection, reduced by one psf for each degree
    of slope in excess of twenty degrees. (3) For valleys, live loadings shall be increased to provide for accumulations of snow. The loading intensity shall be assumed to vary from forty-five psf at the low point to fifteen psf at the ridge. (4) For
    roofs having curved or pyramidal shapes, the proposed live load shall be established by the architect or engineer, subject to approval by the commissioner. (b) Wind load. The provisions of section 27-569 of article five of this subchapter shall apply.
    (c) Concentrated loads. The provisions of subdivision (b) of section 27-557 of this article shall apply. (d) Special loads. (1) When used for purposes such as promenades, assembly areas, or roof gardens, design shall be made for live loads corresponding
    to the particular usage, as indicated in reference standard RS 9-2. Such loads shall be considered as nonconcurrent with the wind load or with the live load specified in subdivision (a) of this section. The design live and wind loads for roofs, as
    specified elsewhere in this subchapter, shall be deemed to provide for incidental use of the roof of a building by the occupants thereof. (2) Where roofs are intended for the ponding of water, the roof shall be designed for the maximum possible depth
    of water which may be ponded thereon as determined by the relative levels of roof deck and overflow weirs or scuppers. Such load need not be considered as occurring simultaneously with wind or live load. (3) Girders and roof trusses (other than joists)
    over garage areas regularly utilized for the repair of vehicles and over manufacturing floors or storage floors used for commercical purposes shall be capable of supporting, in addition to the specified live and wind loads, a concentrated live load
    of two thousand pounds applied at any lower chord panel point for trusses, and at any point of the lower flange for girders. (4) Where roofs are landscaped, the uniform design live load on the landscaped portions shall be thirty psf. The weight of
    the landscaping materials shall be considered as dead load and shall be computed on the basis of saturation of the earth. The areas adjacant to the landscaped portions shall be considered as assembly areas, unless specific provision is made to prevent
    such use. (5) Where equipment is placed on roofs, the design shall provide for the support of such equipment.</text>
