  <text>ยง 27-557 Floor live loads. (a) Uniformly distributed live loads. The minimum design values established in reference standard RS 9-2 for various occupancies or uses shall be used subject to the provisions of subdivision (d) of this section. Where the
    occupancy or use of a space does not conform to any of those listed, the design load shall be determined by the architect or engineer subject to approval by the commissioner. (b) Concentrated live loads. (1) The building framing shall be capable of
    supporting the concentrated live loads established in reference standard RS 9-2, placed so as to produce maximum stress. (2) Floors that support any items of machinery, electrical or mechanical equipment, or other concentrated live load in excess
    of one thousand pounds (including the weights of pads or bases) shall be designed to support such weight as a concentrated load or group of concentrated loads. (c) Nonconcurrence. (1) When a concentrated live load is present, the uniformly distributed
    load may be considered to be omitted in the area occupied by the concentrated load. (2) Where reference standard RS 9-2 indicates that the concentrated live load is nonconcurrent with the uniform live load, it may be assumed that the total concentrated
    load is to be omitted when the uniform load is present and that the total uniform load is to be omitted when the concentrated load is present. (d) Conformance. For purposes of determining that the magnitude of the actual live load conforms to or is
    less than the minimum design live load established in this section, the actual uniform live load shall be approximated by averaging the total load actually applied over a rectangular area of one hundred fifty square feet having no side less than eight
    feet.</text>
