  <text>ยง 27-555 Partition loads. Weights of all partitions shall be considered, using either actual weights at locations shown on the plans or the equivalent uniform load given in subdivision (b) of this section. (a) Actual loads. Where actual partition weights
    are used, the uniform design live load may be omitted from the strip of floor area under each partition. (b) Equivalent uniform load. The equivalent uniform partition loads in reference standard RS 9-1 may be used in lieu of actual partition weights
    except for bearing partitions or partitions in toilet room areas (other than in one- and two-family dwellings), at stairs and elevators, and similar areas where partitions are concentrated. In such cases, actual partition weights shall be used in
    design. Except as otherwise exempted, equivalent uniform loads shall be used in areas where partitions are not definitely located on the plans, or in areas where partitions are subject to rearrangement or location.</text>
