  <text>ยง 27-567 Contributory floor areas. For purposes of computing live load reduction, contributory floor areas shall be determined as follows: (a) For the design of one-way and two-way slabs: the product of the shorter span length and a width equal to one-half
    the shorter span length. Ribbed slabs shall be considered as though the slabs were solid. (b) For the design of slabs in flat plate or flat slab construction: one-half the area of the panel. (c) For the design of columns and girders or trusses framing
    into columns: the loaded area directly supported by the column, girder, or truss. For columns supporting more than one floor, the loaded area shall be the cumulative total area of all the floors that are supported. (d) For the design of joists and
    similar multiple members framing into girders or trusses, or minor framing around openings: twice the loaded area directly supported but not more than the area of the panel in which the framing occurs.</text>
