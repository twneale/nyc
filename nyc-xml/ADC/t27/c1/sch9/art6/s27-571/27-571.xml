  <text>ยง 27-571 Bins and bunkers. Loads on component parts of bins and bunkers may be reduced for friction on sidewalls, provided that sidewalls and supports are proportioned for the increased vertical loads. Where stresses would be increased in any component
    by arching of the fill, the effect of such arching shall be considered.</text>
