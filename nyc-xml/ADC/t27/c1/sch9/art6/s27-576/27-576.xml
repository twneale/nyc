  <text>ยง 27-576 Thermal forces. The design of enclosed buildings more than two hundred fifty feet in plan dimension shall provide for the forces and/or movements resulting from an assumed expansion corresponding to a change in temperature of forty degrees
    F. For exterior exposed frames, arches, or shells regardless of plan dimensions, the design shall provide for the forces and/or movements resulting from an assumed expansion and contraction corresponding to an increase or decrease in temperature of
    forty degrees F for concrete or masonry construction and sixty degrees F for metal construction. For determining required anchorage for piping, the forces shall be determined on the basis of temperature variations for the specific service conditions.
    Friction forces in expansion bearings shall be considered.</text>
