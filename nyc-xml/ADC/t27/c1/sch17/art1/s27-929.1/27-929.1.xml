  <text>ยง 27-929.1 Retroactive requirements for office buildings one hundred feet or more in height. (a) General requirements. (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, all office buildings one hundred feet or more in height and buildings
    classified in occupancy group E one hundred feet or more in height in existence on the effective date of this subdivision shall have a full system of automatic sprinklers installed in accordance with this subchapter. Reports relating to the installation
    of such sprinkler systems shall be filed in accordance with subdivision (b) of section 27-228.5 of this code and installation of such sprinkler systems shall be completed on or before July 1, 2019 or, if applicable, on or before a date specified by
    the commissioner pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (b) of section 27-228.5 of this code. (2) Exception. Where an owner of a building or portion thereof subject to such retroactive requirement demonstrates to the satisfaction of the commissioner
    that the installation of sprinklers in a particular, limited portion of such building is not practicable, either due to structural conditions or because of designation as an interior landmark by the New York city landmarks preservation commission,
    the commissioner may waive such limited portions from the requirements of this section but may require additional fire safety measures to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public. (3) Application to buildings with a full system of automatic
    sprinklers. The provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to buildings in existence on the effective date of this subdivision in which a full system of automatic sprinklers was installed or required to be installed pursuant to any other provision
    of law. Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to limit the applicability of any other provision of this code requiring sprinklers in the buildings referred to herein. (b) Converted buildings. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, on and
    after the effective date of this subdivision, no building one hundred feet or more in height shall be converted to an office building or to a building classified in occupancy group E, whether or not application for such conversion is required to be
    filed with the department, unless a full system of automatic sprinklers is installed in such building in accordance with this subchapter prior to such conversion.
