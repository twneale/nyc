  <text>ยง 27-933 Yard hydrant systems required. Outdoor amusement and exhibition places, oil storage plants, lumber yards, trailer camps, industrial parks, and similar occupancies shall have yard hydrants installed so that the entire area may be reached by
    two hundred fifty feet of hose from a yard hydrant or a street hydrant. Single hydrant connection shall be at least in six inch I.P.S. Such hydrants shall be directly connected with city water main or private water main, or supplied from gravity tanks
    or pressure tanks, as provided in this subchapter. (a) Where the area of such enclosure is more than forty thousand square feet and where the available city water service is less than that specified in paragraph one of subdivision (b) of section 27-945
    of this article, the yard hydrant system shall be supplied as follows: (1) A gravity tank of at least fifty thousand gallon capacity shall be provided and elevated so that the bottom of the tank is at least seventy-five feet above the highest grade
    elevation and at least twenty-five feet above the highest building in the area supplied by this tank. (2) In lieu of paragraph one of this subdivision, there shall be provided a manual fire pump with a capacity of at least one thousand gpm, and a
    suction tank of at least fifty thousand gallon capacity. The suction tank shall be supplied through a six inch connection to the city water main controlled by an automatic ball float valve in the suction tank. A bypass shall be provided so that the
    pump may be fed directly from the city water main. (3) The pump shall be located in a pump house at the street main side of the area or enclosure. (4) Suction from a river or well may be permitted by the commissioner if the required quantity of reasonably
    clean fresh water may be obtained thereby, subject to the approvals of such other authorities as may have jurisdiction over the primary source of supply. (b) The maximum distance between hydrants shall be two hundred fifty feet. At each yard hydrant,
    two hundred fifty feet of rubber lined hose, with a smooth bore one and one-eighth inch approved play-pipe, shall be placed in a hose house painted red, and the words "Fire Hose" in six inch white letters shall be painted on the door. (c) The approval
    of the fire department shall be obtained for location of any monitor nozzles that may be required in addition to yard hydrants. Not more than one monitor nozzle with remote control will be required for each forty thousand square feet of area or fraction
    thereof unless, in the fire department's opinion, an unusual hazard exists. (d) Standpipes and sprinkler systems may be connected to a yard hydrant system in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter. (e) Yard hydrant systems connected to
    city water mains shall be provided with post indicator valves located in an accessible position. Post indicator valves shall be locked open and be painted red. (f) Fire extinguishing equipment, in addition to that prescribed by this section, shall
    be provided in accordance with requirements of chapter four of this title for oil storage plants, oil refineries, and other plants deemed by the fire commissioner to present unusual fire hazards, and also in rooms or spaces housing electrical equipment
    when such fire extinguishing equipment is deemed necessary.</text>
