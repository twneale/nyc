  <text>ยง 27-944 Pressure reducing valves. (a) When the normal hydrostatic pressure at a two and one-half inch hose outlet valve exceeds fifty-five psig, each valve shall be equipped with an adjustable type pressure reducer so that the pressure on the downstream
    side will not exceed fifty psig when the discharge is at the rate of two hundred gpm from a one inch orifice nozzle attached to one hundred feet of two and one-half inch unlined hose. (b) At one and one-half inch hose stations, an adjustable type
    of pressure reducer shall be provided on each hose outlet valve where the hydrostatic pressure exceeds eighty-five psig and shall be so adjusted that the pressure on the downstream side will not exceed eighty psig when seventy gpm is discharged from
    a one-half inch orifice nozzle attached to the length of hose to be provided at the hose station. (c) The pressure reducing valve shall be permanently marked with the address of the premises in which it is installed and with the floor location and
    the setting for the location at which it is to be used.</text>
