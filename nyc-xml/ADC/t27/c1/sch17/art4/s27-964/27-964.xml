  <text>§ 27-964 Sprinkler booster pumps. Where the pressure from the city water main is insufficient to comply with the requirements of section 27-963 of this article but is sufficient to give at least five psig at the highest line of sprinklers as determined
    by test, an automatic, electrically driven pump installed for the purpose of boosting or increasing the city water pressure in the sprinkler system may be accepted subject to the following requirements: (a) Pumps shall be of approved centrifugal type,
    capable of delivering at least two hundred gpm, and shall be capable of supplying twenty-five per cent of the heads, in the largest area supplied, at twenty gpm, at a pressure of at least twenty-five psig at the top of the highest sprinkler riser.
    (b) Pumps shall be maintained under approved automatic control with closed circuit supervisory attachment. The supervisory attachments shall be directly connected to an office where maintenance personnel are in attendance twenty-four hours a day;
    or, in lieu thereof, the supervisory attachment may be directly connected to the central station of an approved operating fire alarm company. The supervisory alarm services shall be arranged so as to provide positive indication at an approved central
    office or sprinkler alarm panel board that the pump has operated or that the source of electrical supply has failed. (c) Such pumps shall also comply with the applicable provisions of sections 27-946 and 27-947 of article three of this subchapter,
    except that only one supply shall be required and no enclosure shall be required.
