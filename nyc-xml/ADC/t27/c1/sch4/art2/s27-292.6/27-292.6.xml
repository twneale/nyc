  <text>ยง 27-292.6 Waiver of requirements. (1) The commissioner may waive the requirements of this subarticle or of subdivision (d) of section 27-357 of this code for the alteration of existing buildings, and for any new building for which a formal application
    together with plans required by such application was filed with an agency of the city or with the battery park city authority prior to September first, nineteen hundred eighty-seven, when such application was required by law or regulation to be approved
    by such agency; provided, however, that such waiver would not significantly adversely affect provisions for health, safety and security and that equally safe and proper alternatives are prescribed and, further, that such waiver is based upon a specific
    finding that strict compliance with the requirement: (a) would create an undue economic burden; or (b) would not achieve its intended objective; or (c) would be physically or legally impossible; or (d) would be unnecessary in light of alternatives
    which insure the achievement of the intended objective or which, without a loss in the level of safety, achieve the intended objective more efficiently, effectively or economically; or (e) would entail a change so slight as to produce a negligible
    additional benefit consonant with the purposes of this code. (2) Each application for a waiver under subdivision one of this section shall be made to the commissioner in writing, setting forth each requirement sought to be waived and the specific
    reason or reasons therefor. The commissioner shall determine, under all of the circumstances presented by such application, which of such requirements may appropriately be waived. The commissioner shall render such determination in a writing which
    shall set forth in detail the commissioner's findings and conclusions with respect to each requirement sought to be waived. A copy of such written determination shall be forwarded to the applicant. Such written determination shall be filed with the
    department and shall be available for public inspection. (3) The mayor's office for the handicapped or its successor agency shall be consulted by and shall advise the commissioner concerning each application for a waiver under subdivision (1) of this
    section.</text>
