    do not have rigging lofts above and that are not at any time used for storage purposes. Sprinklers above rigging lofts shall be located so that no gridiron or other obstruction intervenes between the sprinkler heads and the scenery or scenic elements.
    b. When any part of a stage is sprinklered in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph a of this paragraph, or when rigging lofts are provided, such stage areas and rigging lofts shall be completely separated from audience areas by a deluge
    sprinkler system designed to form a vertical water curtain, with heads spaced to provide a water density of at least three gpm per linear foot. The water curtain system shall be controlled by a deluge valve actuated by a "rate of rise system" and
    " fixed temperature system." The heat actuating devices shall be located on not more than ten foot centers around the perimeter of the sprinklered area or as otherwise required for the type of device used to assure operation of the system. In addition
    to the automatic controls, manual operating devices shall be located at the emergency control station as required by paragraph ten of this subdivision, and adjacent to at least one exit from the stage. Such exit shall be remote from the emergency
    control panel. c. When openings are provided in the stage floor for stage lifts, trap doors or stairs, sprinklers spaced five feet on centers shall be provided around the opening at the ceiling below the stage, and baffles at least twelve inches in
    depth shall be installed around the perimeter of the opening. d. All valves controlling sprinkler supplies shall be provided with tamper switches wired to an annunciator panel located at the emergency control panel. e. The operation of any section
    of the sprinkler system and the deluge system shall activate the emergency ventilating equipment required in paragraph eight of this subdivision. f. The water flow alarm, tamper switches and deluge system equipment shall be provided with central station
