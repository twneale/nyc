  <text>§ 27-922.4 Waivers. a. The commissioner may waive the requirements of this article for the alteration of existing buildings; provided, however, that such waiver is based upon a specific finding that strict compliance with these requirements: (1) would
    create an undue economic burden; or (2) would not achieve its intended objective; or (3) would be physically or legally impossible; or (4) would be unnecessary in light of alternatives which insure the achievement of the intended objective or which
    achieve the intended objective more efficiently, effectively or economically; or (5) would entail a change so slight as to produce a negligible additional benefit consonant with the purposes of this article. b. Each application for a waiver under
    subdivision a of this section shall be made to the commissioner in writing, setting forth each requirement sought to be waived and the specific reason or reasons therefor. The commissioner shall determine, under all of the circumstances presented
    by such application, which of such requirements may appropriately be waived. The commissioner shall render such determination in a writing which shall set forth in detail the commissioner's findings and conclusions with respect to each requirement
    sought to be waived. A copy of such written determination shall be forwarded to the applicant. Such written determination shall be filed with the department and shall be available for public inspection.</text>
