  <text>ยง 27-904 Establishing gas supply. It shall be unlawful for any utility company to supply gas to a building, place or premises in which new meters other than replacement are required until a certificate of approval of gas installation from the department
    of buildings is filed with such utility company. When new gas service piping has been installed it shall be locked-off by the utility either by locking the gas service line valve or by installing a locking device on the outside gas service line valve.
    The lock shall not be removed until the gas meter piping (other than utility owned) and gas distribution piping has been inspected and certified as required by the department of buildings as being ready for service.</text>
