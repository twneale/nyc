  <text>ยง 27-901 General requirements. Plumbing and gas piping shall be designed and installed so as to satisfy the following conditions and the requirements of reference standard RS-16: (a) All occupied premises shall have potable water. Every building intended
    for human habitation, occupancy, or use shall be provided with a supply of potable water. (b) Sufficient water required. Plumbing fixtures, devices, and appurtenances shall be supplied with water in sufficient volume and at pressures adequate to enable
    them to function properly. The pipes conveying the water shall be of sufficient size to provide the water required without undue pressure reduction and without undue noise under all normal conditions of use. (c) Water conservation. Plumbing shall
    be designed and adjusted to use the minimum quantity of water consistent with proper performance and cleansing of the fixture of plumbing appurtenance. (d) Safeguarding against explosion. Devices for heating and storing water shall be designed, installed,
    and maintained to guard against rupture of the containing vessel through overheating. (e) Connection to public water supply systems and to sanitary or combined sewer systems. (1) GENERAL. a. The water distribution system and system for conveying sewage
    from any building in which plumbing fixtures are installed shall be connected, respectively, to a public water main and a sanitary or combined sewer if either or both are available and, regarding the sewer, if the department determines that connection
    thereto is feasible. The department shall determine that connection is feasible if: 1. the sewer is of adequate capacity to receive all sewage flowing from the building; 2. the sewer is in adequate physical condition to receive such sewage; 3. no
    physical obstacles exist, between the boundaries of the lot or tract of land on which the building is located and the sewer, which would make connection to the sewer impracticable; 4. the elevation of the sewer in relation to the lot or tract of land
    on which the building is located is such that conveyance of the sewage from the building to the sewer is not impracticable; 5. the sewer is located in the same drainage area as all or most of the lot or tract of land on which the building is located;
    and 6. no other factor reasonably related to the conveyance of sewage from the building to the sewer would make such connection impracticable or undesirable as a proper means of sewage disposal. b. Where a public water main is not available, an individual
    potable water supply shall be provided, and where neither a sanitary nor a combined sewer is available to which the department determines that connection is feasible, a private sewer or private sewage disposal system shall be provided. All such private
    systems shall be provided subject to the approval of the commissioner and of any other agency or agencies having jurisdiction, and constructed in accordance with the requirements of reference standard RS-16 and, with respect to the construction of
    individual on site private sewage disposal systems, in accordance with the specifications and standards prescribed by the commissioner, in consultation with the commissioner of environmental protection, pursuant to section six hundred forty-three
    of the charter. c. Extensions of public sewers and water mains shall be made in accordance with the regulations of the department of environmental protection. (2) SYSTEMS AVAILABLE. a. A public water main, and a sanitary or combined sewer for the
    purpose of conveying sewage, shall be deemed available to a building in which plumbing fixtures are installed, except to a one- or two-family dwelling, if a property line of such building is within five hundred feet (measured along a street, alley,
    or right-of-way) of the public water supply system or the sewer. The connection shall be made in accordance with the applicable standards of the department of environmental protection. b. A public water supply system, and a sanitary or combined sewer
    for the purpose of conveying sewage, shall be deemed available to a one- and two-family dwelling if a property line of such dwelling is within one hundred feet (measured along a street, alley, or right-of-way) of the public water supply system or
    the sewer. The connection shall be made in accordance with the applicable standards of the department of environmental protection, provided, however, that such one- and two-family dwelling need not connect directly to the sewer if the common elements
    of an internal private drain are located in a dedicated, unobstructed right-of-way that extends to the sewer with a minimum width of ten feet located entirely outside of the building footprint and outside of all overhangs and projections that are
    less than fourteen feet in height above grade. c. Where two or more one- or two-family dwellings are to be constructed on a tract of land, or where a substantial improvement of any other type of building or buildings is contemplated on a tract of
    land, the public water supply system and/or the sanitary or combined sewer may be declared available thereto by the agencies having jurisdiction thereon even though the distances specified in subparagraphs a and b of this paragraph are exceeded. (f)
    Well water systems. No well or individual water supply may be installed for any purpose without the approval of the commissioner and of the department of health and mental hygiene and the department of environmental protection. (g) Design and maintenance
    of system for conveying sewage from building. The system for conveying sewage from the building shall be designed, constructed and maintained to guard against fouling, deposit of solids, and clogging, and shall be provided with adequate cleanouts
    so arranged that the pipes may be readily cleaned. (h) Exclusion of certain substances from the plumbing system. (1) DETRIMENTAL OR DANGEROUS MATERIAL. No person shall deposit, by any means, any of the following into the building drainage system or
    sewer: ashes, cinders, rags, flammable, poisonous, or explosive liquids, gases, oils, grease, or any other material that could obstruct, damage, or overload such system, or that could interfere with the normal operation of the sewage treatment processes.
    (2) INDUSTRIAL WASTES. Wastes from hospitals, chemical plants, laundries, abattoirs, or any other industrial wastes that could be detrimental to the public sewer or public health, shall be treated before such wastes are discharged into the public
    sewer. At the time of the filing of plumbing plans for any hospital, chemical plant, laundry, abattoir, or any other industrial structure, a statement shall be filed with the commissioner indicating the substances, ingredients, or matter, that will
    be discharged into the sewer, together with written approval of the department of environmental protection for the method of treatment of said substance, ingredient or matter, before it is discharged into the public sewer. (i) Prevention of contamination.
    Plumbing fixtures, devices, and appliances shall be provided with adequate protection to prevent contamination of food, water, sterile goods, and similar materials by backflow of sewage. The fixture, device, or appliance shall be connected indirectly
    with the building drainage system when necessary. (j) Drainage below street level. The drainage of all sanitary and storm water below the crown level of the street sewer, or below a level where backflow from the street sewer is possible, shall be
    conveyed to a sewage ejector and/or sump through a system of subhouse drains, and lifted into the street sewer or disposal system. (k) Disposal of storm water. Storm water falling or coming to rest on property on which new buildings or substantial
    horizontal enlargements are to be constructed, and on all streets and other paved areas constructed or altered in connection with the construction of such new buildings or substantial horizontal enlargements, shall be disposed of in accordance with
    the requirements of reference standard RS-16 and the rules and regulations of the department of environmental protection. No person providing a system for disposing of storm water, as required by this subdivision, shall in any way alter, relocate
