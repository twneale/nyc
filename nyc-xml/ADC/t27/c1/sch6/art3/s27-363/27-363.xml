  <text>ยง 27-363 Remote location. (a) When more than one exit is required from a floor of a building, each such required exit shall be placed as remote from the others as is practicable. Where this results in a distance between exits exceeding the maximum travel
    distances required by section 27-357, additional remote vertical exits shall be provided. (b) In addition to the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section: (1) For exits serving spaces classified in occupancy groups G or J-2, in no event shall
    such exits be less than fifteen feet distant from each other. (2) For exits serving spaces classified in other occupancies, in no event shall such distance be less than thirty feet or one-third the maximum travel distance required by section 27-357,
    whichever is greater. (c) On any floor containing ten thousand square feet or more in a high rise building classified in occupancy group E (office space), each exit that is required to be remote from another exit shall not share any common walls,
    floors, ceilings, scissor stair assemblies, or other enclosures.
