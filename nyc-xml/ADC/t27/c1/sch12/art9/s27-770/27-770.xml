  <text>§ 27-770 Noise control of mechanical equipment. (a) Minimum airborne noise insulation requirements. (1) BOILER ROOMS. Boiler rooms adjoining dwelling spaces, either vertically or horizontally, shall be separated therefrom by floor-ceiling or partition
    constructions having a minimum STC rating of fifty. (2) MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT SPACES. Spaces or shafts containing air conditioning, refrigeration, or ventilating equipment, elevator machinery, or other mechanical equipment shall be separated both vertically
    and horizontally from dwelling units by constructions that will provide a minimum STC rating of fifty. Spaces or shafts containing equipment totaling more than seventy-five rated h.p. shall not be located vertically or horizontally adjacent to dwelling
    units unless the total sound power level output of all the equipment in the space or shaft is certified not to exceed the maximum sound power levels of table 12-3 in any octave band. Such sound power level ratings shall be obtained by tests conducted
    in accordance with the procedures of reference standard RS 12-5. a. Ventilating openings into mechanical equipment spaces. Ventilating openings into boiler rooms and other mechanical equipment spaces shall not be located in yards or courts where there
    are windows opening from living quarters, unless such ventilating openings are provided with sound attenuating devices if needed to limit noise transmission to NC-40 (noise criterion) levels in the exposed dwelling units. For permits issued after
    January first, nineteen hundred seventy-two, the permissible noise levels shall not exceed NC-35. b. Noise criteria requirements. Noise criteria requirements prescribed in this subchapter shall be in accordance with reference standard RS 12-4. Table

    measured within the dwelling unit do not exceed the levels given in table 12-5. (For Table 12-4 see chapter 839 of the laws of 1986) Notes: a. The minimum distance shall be measured in a straight line regardless of obstructions. Interpolated levels
    may be used for distances between those given in this table. See note a. at end of table 12-3. 1. In the event sound power level data for the exterior mechanical equipment is not available, the sound pressure levels in octave bands, of the exterior
    mechanical equipment shall be measured. 2. The measurements shall be obtained with the microphone of the measuring equipment located at the interior of the dwelling unit affected in a line with the window nearest the exterior mechanical equipment.
    The window shall be fully open and the microphone shall be located three ft. away from the open portion of the window. 3. Measurements shall be obtained during times when the ambient sound pressure levels, in octave bands, are at least six db lower
    at all octave bands than the sound pressure levels measured with the exterior equipment operating. By ambient sound pressure levels is meant the measured sound pressure levels, at the above described measuring location, with the exterior equipment
    not in operation. b. For permits issued after January first, nineteen hundred seventy-two, the permitted maximum sound power levels for exterior mechanical equipment adjoining buildings shall be changed as follows: (For Table 12-5 see chapter 839
    of the laws of 1986) Notes: a. Measurements shall be obtained with a sound level meter and octave band analyzer, calibrated both electronically and acoustically before and after the measurements are made. The equipment used shall meet the requirements
    of reference standards RS 12-6. b. For permits issued after January first, nineteen hundred seventy-two, the maximum sound pressure levels shall be changed as follows: ====================================================================== Octave Bands
