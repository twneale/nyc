  <text>§ 27-762 Crawl spaces. (a) Buildings and structures without basements. In buildings and structures constructed without basements, and in which the first floor construction does not bear directly on the ground, a space at least eighteen inches high shall
    be provided directly under the floor beams, girders or sill of the first floor construction. Where the floor above such a space is constructed of wood or metal, the space shall be ventilated by one of the following means: (1) At least four widely-distributed
    ventilating openings, providing a total net free area of at least one eight-hundredth of the area of the crawl space, shall be provided in the foundation walls, and the ground within the crawl space shall be covered with a vapor barrier in durability
    equivalent to at least fifty-five pounds, roofing felt with unsealed laps and with a transmission rate of one perm or less. At least two ventilating openings, providing a total net free area of at least one fifteen-hundredth the area of the crawl
    space shall be provided in foundation walls, provided that a vapor barrier with a transmission rate of one perm or less is installed over the entire underside of the first floor construction and overlaps the walls. (2) Other means acceptable to the
    commissioner. (b) Buildings and structures with basements. No foundation wall vents shall be required where one side of a crawl space is completely open except for structural members, to a basement that has an area at least equivalent to that of the
    crawl space, provided that the basement is naturally ventilated by openings complying with section 27-749 of article six of this subchapter and having a free openable area of at least five per cent of the floor area of the basement.</text>
