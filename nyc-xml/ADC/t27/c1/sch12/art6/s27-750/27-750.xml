  <text>ยง 27-750 Area of ventilating openings. Ventilating openings in all habitable rooms or spaces shall have a free openable area of at least five percent of the floor area of the room or space ventilated and where there is an enclosed or partially enclosed
    balcony or space above a setback complying with section 27-733 of article three of this subchapter the ventilating openings shall have a free openable area of at least five per cent of the combined floor area of such room and portion of the balcony
    or space directly adjoining and in front of such room. Each required ventilating opening shall have a minimum openable area of six square feet. Where fresh air is furnished in any habitable room or space by mechanical means supplying a minimum of
    forty cfm the free openable area of the openings may be reduced to one-half of the above requirements but not less than five and one-half square feet in aggregate. In all occupiable rooms or spaces, the free openable area shall be used to calculate
    the index for ventilation (section 27-753 of article seven of this subchapter), which shall determine the minimum requirements for supplementary mechanical ventilation.</text>
