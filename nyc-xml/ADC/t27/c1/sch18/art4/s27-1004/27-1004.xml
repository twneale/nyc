  <text>§ 27-1004 Posting of inspection certificate.--a. At the time the equipment use permit is issued, an inspection certificate issued by the commissioner shall be posted. No such certificate shall be issued for elevators which are not subject to periodic
    inspections pursuant to section 27-998. The certificate shall be in such form as determined by the commissioner and shall be posted in the car of every passenger and freight elevator and on or near every escalator and power operated scaffold and in
    a frame with a transparent cover. b. In place of posting inspection certificates in those locations specified in subdivision a of this section, certificates may be kept in the on site building manager's office. In a building where this option is elected,
    there must be a building manager's office open during normal business hours, and there must be posted in each location specified in subdivision a of this section a notice in a frame with a transparent cover, or a plaque with an indelible inscription,
    stating that the inspection certificate is located in the building manager's office and identifying the location of such office.</text>
