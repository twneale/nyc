  <text>ยง 27-809 Insulation and clearances. All accessible piping in habitable and occupiable rooms carrying steam, water, or other fluids at temperatures exceeding one hundred sixty-five degrees Fahrenheit shall be insulated to prevent the temperature at the
    outer surface of the insulation from exceeding sixty degrees Fahrenheit above the ambient temperature. The openings for insulated piping through combustible floors, walls, partitions, ceilings and other combustible construction shall include clearance
    and insulation adequate to satisfy the requirements of section 27-792 of article one of this subchapter. Where accessible piping carries a fluid not exceeding two hundred fifty degrees Fahrenheit and insulation would interfere with the functioning
    of the system, such piping may be uninsulated provided sufficient clearance is maintained from the combustible construction so that the temperature limitation of section 27-792 of article one of this subchapter is not exceeded, and all uninsulated
    piping shall be provided with at least one-half inch clearance from combustible materials.</text>
