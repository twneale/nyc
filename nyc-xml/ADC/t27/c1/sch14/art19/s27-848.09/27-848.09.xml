  <text>ยง 27-848.09 Factory-built fireplaces, fireplace stoves and room heaters. (a) Acceptance. Factory-built fireplaces, fireplace stoves and room heaters shall be listed and accepted for use as wood burning appliances. (b) Occupancy group limitations. Factory-built
    fireplaces, fireplace stoves and room heaters shall not be permitted in buildings other than those in residential occupancy group classifications J-2 and J-3, except that installations within other occupancy groups may be authorized by the commissioner
    pursuant to rules and regulations promulgated by the department. (c) Chimney requirements. (1) The chimney systems of factory-built fireplaces, fireplace stoves and room heaters shall be constructed in accordance with section 27-869.01. (2) No chimney
    shall serve more than one factory-built fireplace, fireplace stove or room heater or be pierced to serve any other appliance. (d) Additional limitations. Factory-built fireplaces, fireplace stoves or room heaters shall be: (1) located only in exterior
    rooms, and (2) limited to space heating of the room within which they are located. (e) Chimney connectors. (l) Stovepipe. a. The stovepipe (or chimney connector) connecting a factory-built fireplace, fireplace stove or room heater to a chimney may
    contain no more than two elbows. The total length of the connecting pipe should be kept as short as possible while maintaining the required minimum spacing between the factory-built fireplace, fireplace stove or room heater and combustible materials.
    See subdivision (h) of section 27-848.08 of this code. b. The connector pipe shall be as large as the flue collars (where the connector pipe joins the factory-built fireplace, fireplace stove or room heater), and shall be fabricated from steel coated
    with a high temperature rust inhibitor. c. The pipe's horizontal section shall rise one-quarter inch for each foot of pipe, with the highest point being at the chimney inlet, and shall not be longer than three quarters of the chimney height. d. When
    joining sections of pipe, the joints shall overlap at least two inches, with the crimped (male) end pointing down to prevent creosote drip or leak. Each joint shall be secured with three sheet metal screws. All fits shall be snug. e. The thimble shall
    be cemented with high temperature cement at the flue inlet. The pipe shall not project into the flue itself. f. Connector pipe clearance to combustible materials shall be at least three times the pipe diameter (e.g. eighteen inches for six inch pipe),
    but not less than eighteen inches. g. Stovepipes shall not pass through floors, ceilings or closets. Stovepipes shall not pass through exterior walls unless directly connected with a thimble to the chimney as noted in subparagraph h of this paragraph.
    h. Alternately, a listed and accepted noncombustible thimble larger in diameter than the connector pipe, or a burned fireclay or metal thimble surrounded by not less than twelve inches of brickwork may be used for protection. i. Connectors and chimneys
    for factory-built fireplaces, fireplace stoves and room heaters shall be designed, located and installed to permit ready access for internal inspection and cleaning, in compliance with the requirements of subchapter fifteen of this chapter. (2) Connection
    to masonry fireplace flue. A factory-built fireplace stove or room heater or insert may use a masonry fireplace flue when the following conditions are met: a. There is a connector which extends from the fireplace stove or room heater to the flue liner.
    b. The cross-sectional area of the flue is no more than three times the cross-sectional area of the flue collar of the factory-built fireplace, fireplace stove or room heater. c. There is a noncombustible seal below the entry point of the connector
    if the appliance vents directly through the chimney wall above the smoke chamber. d. The chimney system can be inspected and cleaned. e. Air from the habitable space is not used to dilute combustion products in the chimney flue. f. Hearth extensions
    are provided in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions or are of masonry of noncombustible construction in accordance with subdivision (d) of section 27-848.07.</text>
