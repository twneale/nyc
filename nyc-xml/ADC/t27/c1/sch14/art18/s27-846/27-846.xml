  <text>ยง 27-846 Accessibility. Sufficient space shall be provided around the incinerator and its appurtenances to facilitate cleaning, repair, and servicing. Clearance shall be provided to allow the cleanout doors to be completely opened so that all parts
    of the combustion chamber, ash pit, separation chambers, etc. may be reached and so implements used for this purpose can be freely manipulated. All dampers, gates, burners, valves, levers, etc., shall be accessible for repair and adjustment or replacement.
    No construction shall be located closer than sixteen inches to any part of an incinerator, except that noncombustible structural members two feet wide or less parallel to the incinerator, may be located as close as six inches to the incinerator, provided
    such members do not reduce accessibility to any moving parts of the incinerator.</text>
