    and incinerator rooms which have been approved for such use, may be retained as approved. b. Existing incinerator combustion chambers may be used in whole or in part as refuse collection rooms provided the grates are removed and provided they comply
    with the provisions of section 27-837 of this article. c. Floors of refuse collection rooms shall be constructed of concrete and shall be sloped to a floor drain within the room, connected to the house drain. A hose connection shall be provided within
    the room. d. A hopper and cut-off door shall be provided at the bottom of the refuse chute. Where compacting equipment is used, it shall be located entirely within the enclosure of the refuse collection room except that motors, pumps and controls
    may be installed in adjacent rooms. e. Compacting equipment shall meet the criteria of the department of environmental protection and be approved. Where such equipment is installed so that the refuse flows directly into it, the compacting equipment
