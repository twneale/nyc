  <text>ยง 27-431 Separation of direct-fired dryers. In moderate hazard dry cleaning establishments, direct-fired dryers shall not be used. In low hazard dry cleaning establishments using nonflammable solvents only, direct fired dryers may be used, but such
    dryers shall not be located within twenty-five feet of a dry cleaning unit unless a noncombustible partition (which may be glazed), equipped with self-closing doors, is provided between the dry cleaning unit and the flame producing device. This partition
    may provide either complete or partial separation, provided that any partial separation shall be so arranged that the line of air travel around the partition from the cleaning units to the dryer is a minimum of twenty-five feet. Where a solid noncombustible
    partition is constructed extending to the ceiling and all portions of the enclosure are solid, except for self-closing access doors, and outdoor air for combustion and drying is supplied, the separation may be reduced to fifteen feet.</text>
