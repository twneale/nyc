    radiation shielding or other requirements for the materials to be stored. When any materials are subject to melting, vaporization, or oxidation under fire conditions, the storage vaults shall be constructed of walls having a fire-resistance rating
    of at least four hours, and the vaults shall be equipped with automatic sprinklers complying with the construction requirements of subchapter seventeen of this chapter and shall be vented through devices to decontaminate the air to a safe level. Doors
    opening into storage vaults shall meet shielding requirements and have a fire-protection rating of not less than three hours. All bins, shelving, partitions, and pallets in storage vaults shall be of noncombustible materials. Other methods of storage
    permitted by the health department or the atomic energy commission, such as storage under water, may be used.
