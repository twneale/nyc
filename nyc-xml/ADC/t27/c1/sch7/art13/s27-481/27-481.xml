  <text>ยง 27-481 Protection of adjoining property. (a) Curbs and bumpers. Open parking lots shall be completely separated from adjoining land by curbs or bumpers of concrete, masonry, steel, heavy timber, or other similar and equally substantial materials,
    securely anchored so as to stop motor vehicles. Curbs and bumpers shall be at least eight inches high and eight inches wide. The only openings permitted in required curbs and bumpers shall be for drainage and for motor vehicle entrances and exits,
    and at pedestrian entrances. (b) Drainage.--Where the surface paving of an open parking lot is non-porous, such lot shall be drained as required by subdivisions (b), (c) or (d) of section P110.2 of reference standard RS-16, as applicable. An asphaltic
    concrete surface, not to exceed one and one-half inches in thickness after compaction, shall be considered a porous surface provided such surface will pass an amount of water equivalent to one-half inch of rainfall per hour and provided such surface
    is underlaid by permeable soil, except that whenever an off-street parking facility is constructed in connection with the construction of a new building, or whenever such parking facility falls within the definition of a substantial horizontal enlargement
    as set forth in subdivision (a) of section P110.2 of reference standard RS-16, all storm water falling or coming to rest on such parking facility shall be disposed of as provided in section P110.2 of reference standard RS-16.</text>
