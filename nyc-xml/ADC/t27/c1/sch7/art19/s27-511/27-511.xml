    door, on the same level or above the level of the tent or air-supported structure. A tent or air-supported structure may abut another building on the same lot if there are no unprotected openings or exits above or within thirty feet as above stipulated,
    if there is no door between them that is a required exit, and if the exterior wall separating them meets the requirements of subchapter five of this chapter for fire divisions. Exceptions. Requirements for separation from other buildings on the site
