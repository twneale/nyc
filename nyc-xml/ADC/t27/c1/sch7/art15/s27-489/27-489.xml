  <text>ยง 27-489 Construction. Pools shall be constructed so as to be water tight and easily cleaned. They shall be built of nonabsorbent materials with smooth surfaces and shall be free of open cracks and open joints. (a) Walls. The walls of pools shall be
    vertical for at least the top two feet six inches below the normal water level. The junctions between the side walls and the bottom shall be coved. A pool overflow shall be provided meeting the requirements of reference standard RS-16. (b) Bottom
    slopes. The bottom of any portion of a pool where the water is less than five feet six inches deep shall have a maximum slope of one foot vertically for every fifteen feet horizontally. (c) Ladders. There shall be a ladder or steps with handrails
    at the deep end and at the shallow end of every pool. Ladders and steps shall have nonslip treads. (d) Walkways. Every pool shall have a walkway at least five feet wide around its entire perimeter. The walkway shall have a nonslip surface and be so
    constructed that it does not drain into the pool. (e) Hand-holds. Every pool shall be constructed so that either the overflow gutter, if provided, or the top of the side walls afford a continuous hand-hold for bathers. (f) Markings. Permanent markings
    showing the depth of the shallow end, break points, diving depth, and deep end shall be provided so as to be visible from both inside and outside the pool. (g) Spectator area. Areas exclusively intended for spectators shall meet the applicable requirements
    of subchapter eight of this chapter for places of assembly. (h) Diving boards and towers. Diving towers shall be rigidly constructed and permanently anchored. The depth of the water below a diving board shall be at least eight feet six inches for
    boards one meter (3.28 ft.) or less above the water. For diving boards more than one meter and not more than three meters (9 ft. 10 in.) above the water, the depth below the board shall be at least twelve feet. For diving boards or platforms more
    than three meters above the water, the depth below the board shall be at least sixteen feet. Indoor pools shall provide at least twelve feet overhead clearance above all diving boards.</text>
