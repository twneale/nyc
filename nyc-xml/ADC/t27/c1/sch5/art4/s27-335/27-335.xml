  <text>ยง 27-335 Exterior trim. For the purposes of this section, exterior trim shall be defined as any material, other than door and window frames and sash, that is applied to exterior walls and which, if removed or destroyed, will not reduce the structural
    stability of the building enclosure, and which is installed so as not to reduce the required fire-resistance rating of the enclosure. Exterior trim shall include cornices, overhanging eaves, fascias, belt courses, pilasters, surrounds, gutters, leaders,
    half-timber work, shutters, trellises, etc. (a) Combustible exterior trim: (1) May not be used on buildings required to be of construction group I except that slow-burning plastics or approved equivalent materials may be used up to a height of twenty-five
    feet, provided that such trim covers not more than five percent of the surface area of the building enclosure (openings not included), or not more than one thousand square feet. (2) May be used to a height of forty feet on buildings of construction
    classes II-A, II-B, and II-C provided that such trim covers not more than ten percent of the surface area of the building enclosure (openings not included), projects not more than eight inches beyond the outside face of the building enclosure, and
    has an exterior separation of at least fifteen feet measured from the outermost surface of the trim. EXCEPTION. Cornices, gutters, or overhanging roofs, when permitted, may project up to three feet beyond the outside face of the building enclosure
    if they are at least eight inches above the topmost opening, are firestopped as required by section 27-345 of article five of this suchapter and either: a. have their combustible structural members protected by soffits and fascias of a material or
    assembly having at least a one hour fire-resistance rating, or b. have all their combustible members separated from the roof and ceiling construction by construction having the fire-resistance rating required for the exterior wall, with at least four
    inches of solid noncombustible material below, at the sides, and at the ends of such members; (3) May be used to an unlimited extent in buildings of construction classes II-D and II-E on exterior walls that are not required to have a fire-resistance
    rating.</text>
