  <text>ยง 27-322 Tests. Samples of all materials or assemblies of materials required by this code to have a fire-resistance rating, fire-protection rating, or flame spread rating, or required to be noncombustible, fire-retardant treated, or slow burning, shall
    be tested under the applicable test procedures specified herein, in accordance with the acceptance requirements of section 27-131 of article seven of subchapter one of this chapter. The fire-resistance rating of materials and assemblies listed in
    reference standard RS 5-1 may be used to determine conformance with the fire resistance requirements of this code. In addition to the performance results, test reports shall give all technical data pertaining to the nature of the constituent materials,
    such as the physical properties, chemical composition and properties, coefficient of expansion, thicknesses of materials, etc. Except as listed in reference standard RS 5-1, any assembly using a component having a structural base of noncombustible
    material covered with an integrally manufactured combustible surfacing material, shall be approved for fire-resistance rating.</text>
