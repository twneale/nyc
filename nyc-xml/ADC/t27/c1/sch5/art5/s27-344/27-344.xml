  <text>ยง 27-344 Shafts. The requirements of this section shall apply to all shafts, except that floor openings accommodating a slide pole in a fire house and openings other than for ventilation, chimneys or gas vents in buildings three stories or less in height
    classified in occupancy group J-3 shall be exempt from these requirements, and except as more restrictive requirements may be specified for chimneys and gas vents in subchapter fifteen of this chapter, stairway enclosures in subchapter six, duct enclosures
    in subchapter thirteen, elevator, escalator, and dumbwaiter enclosures in subchapter eighteen of this chapter, and except as permitted in reference standard RS 5-18. (a) Construction. Shafts shall be enclosed with materials having at least fire-resistance
    rating required by table 3-4. A shaft that serves the topmost story of a building shall extend through the roof at least thirty-six inches above any combustible roof construction. Where the roof construction is of noncombustible materials, the shaft
    shall extend through any concealed space within the roof construction and may terminate at the underside of the roof deck. Pipes and ducts penetrating shaft construction shall comply with the requirements of section 27-343 of this article. (b) Combustible
    Contents. Shafts shall be kept free of bookstacks or other combustible contents except for stair construction as permitted under subchapter six of this chapter, duct and pipe coverings as permitted under subchapters thirteen and sixteen, and elevator
    car enclosures as permitted under subchapter eighteen of this chapter. (c) Openings in shafts. All shaft openings below the top terminus shall be provided with opening protectives that comply with section 27-329 of this subchapter and table 5-3. In
    shafts that contain only one opening below the roof terminus, no opening protective need be provided. Openings in elevator and dumbwaiter shafts shall comply only with the requirements of subchapter eighteen of this chapter. Where a window is located
    in a shaft wall that is an exterior wall and is ten stories or less above grade or three stories or less above a roof, it shall be protected against entrance by a permanently secured grille consisting of 5/8 in. dia. bars, 10 in. o. c. vertically,
    or by a stationary metal sash window having 1/8 in. thick solid section steel muntins, 8 in. o. c. one way. This protection shall not be required in stair shafts where there is a stair landing or platform not more than three feet directly below the
    window sill. (d) Smoke venting of closed shafts. All closed shafts having an area exceeding four square feet, other than elevator or dumbwaiter shafts, shall be provided with a smoke vent having an area of at least three and one-half percent of the
    maximum shaft area at any floor, but in no event less than one-half square foot. Elevator and dumbwaiter shaft vents shall comply with the requirements of subchapter eighteen of this chapter. Smoke vents may be windows, louvers, skylights, vent ducts,
    or similar devices. Vent ducts shall be enclosed by construction having the same fire resistance rating as required for the shaft enclosure. Such vent ducts shall extend vertically, diagonally, or horizontally as provided below. (1) Through any roof
    of the building provided the vent opening is at least ten feet from any window, door, outside stairway, or interior lot line. This dimension may be reduced to five feet if the vent duct is extended up to at at least the level of the top of the window
    or door. A vent that is required to extend above a roof shall extend at least eight inches above a roof assembly constructed of noncombustible materials, and at least thirty-six inches above a roof assembly constructed of combustible materials that
    are within a horizontal distance of ten feet. (2) Through an exterior wall of the building, provided there are no openings in the wall within a distance of thirty feet vertically above the vent opening, and within five feet either side of the vent
    opening. When a side of a shaft is an exterior wall or a wall of a roof bulkhead, the required vent may be a louver or window. Any window or louver located in a shaft wall above a roof constructed of combustible materials shall have its sill at least
    thirty-six inches above the roof. (e) Terminus of shaft vents. Of the total required vent area for shafts, at least one-third shall be clear opening to the outdoors, either in the form of fixed louvers, ridge vents, or hooded or goosenecked openings.
    In lieu thereof, skylights or trap doors may be used if constructed and arranged to open automatically by fusible link or other mechanical device when subjected to a temperature of one hundred sixty degrees Fahrenheit or to a rapid rise in temperature
    at a rate of fifteen to twenty degrees Fahrenheit per minute. The remaining portion of the required vent area may be a window or skylight glazed with plain glass not more than one-eighth inch thick or slow burning plastic. (f) Machine rooms. Any compartment
    containing machinery that communicates with a shaft enclosure shall comply with all requirements for shafts. The required louver or glazing shall not be located in any door leading into such compartment.</text>
