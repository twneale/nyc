  <text>ยง 27-669 Pile reactions. The loads to be used in computing pile reactions shall be determined as provided in section 27-668 of this article except that where piles penetrate fill, clay, silt, peat, or similar compressible strata, the pile loads shall
    be increased by the amount of drag exerted by such material, and by any overlaying strata, during consolidation. Computation of the amount of drag shall consider the amount of added fill, the amount of shear strain between pile (or group) and the
    soil, the ratio of vertical to horizontal pressure in the soil, and the arrangement of the piles. The soil surrounding or underlying the pile cap shall not be considered as providing any vertical support for the cap.</text>
