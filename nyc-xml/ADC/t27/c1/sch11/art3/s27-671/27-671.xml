  <text>ยง 27-671 Eccentricities. Eccentricity of loading in foundations, including eccentricity of loading on the bases of retaining walls, shall be investigated and the maximum soil pressure or pile load (considering eccentricity) shall be kept within the
    safe capacity thereof as established in articles four and eight of this subchapter. Soil pressure and pile load due to eccentricity shall be computed on the basis of straight line distribution of foundation reaction. However, other modes of distribution
    of the foundation reaction may be assumed, subject to the approval of the commissioner, if it can be demonstrated that the pile and/or soil is capable of sufficient plastic deformation to develop such mode of distribution without failure.</text>
