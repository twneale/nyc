  <text>ยง 27-680 Utility services. Where utility service lines are to be laid in soil materials of class 11-65, provision shall be made to prevent damage to such service lines as follows: (a) Where the lines enter a structure, including a building, a manhole,
    or a junction chamber, that is rigidly supported on piles or in firm bearing material, the services shall be supported on piles or bearing materials of adequate firmness to prevent differential settlement of the service lines with respect to the structure;
    otherwise, provisions, such as oversized sleeves, flexible connections, utility tunnels, or other approved device, shall be made to permit the anticipated differential movement to occur without damage to the service lines. (b) Where the lines enter
    a structure that is supported on soil materials of class 11-65 or on soft clay or loose silt deposits, and engineering analysis shall be made of the probable differential settlement of the utility service line with respect to the structure, and provision
    shall be made to accommodate such displacement, as described in subdivision (a) of this section.</text>
