  <text>ยง 27-679 Bearing capacity of nominally unsatisfactory bearing materials. Whenever soils exploration shows that the proposed foundation would rest on, or be underlain by, nominally unsatisfactory bearing materials, a report based on soil tests and foundation
    analysis (including analysis of undisturbed samples) shall be submitted by an architect or engineer, demonstrating, subject to the approval of the commissioner, that the proposed construction, under a condition of one hundred percent over load, is
    safe against failure of the soil materials. The report shall also show that the probable total magnitude and distribution of settlement to be expected under design conditions will not result in instability of the building or stresses in the structure
    in excess of the allowable values established in subchapter ten of this chapter. In addition, the following provisions shall apply: (a) Fill materials. (1) CONTROLLED FILLS. Fills shall be considered as satisfactory bearing materials of class 6-65
    or 7-65 when placed in accordance with the following procedures, under the provisions for controlled inspection. a. Before placement of fill, the existing ground surface shall be stripped of all organic growth, timber, rubbish, and debris. After stripping,
    the ground surface shall be compacted to the density in subparagraph d of this paragraph. b. Materials for fill shall consist of sand, gravel, crushed stone, crushed gravel, or a mixture of these, and shall contain no organic matter. The fill materials
    shall contain no particles exceeding four inches in the largest dimension. No more than thirty per cent of the material shall be retained on a three-quarter inch sieve. The material passing the three quarter inch sieve shall contain, by weight, no
    more than forty percent passing the one hundred sieve, or twelve percent passing the two hundred sieve. c. The grading of the fill shall be determined in accordance with the applicable procedures of reference standards RS 11-1 and RS 11-2. d. Fill
    shall be placed and compacted at its optimum moisture content, in uniform layers not more than twelve inches thick (after compaction) and each layer shall be thoroughly compacted to a density not less than ninety-five percent of the density prescribed
    in reference standard RS 11-3. The field density shall be verified by in-place density tests made on each lift of the embankment. Fill shall not be placed when frozen or placed on a frozen or wet sub-grade. (2) UNCONTROLLED FILLS. Fill material, other
    than controlled fill, may be used for the support of buildings, other than one- and two-family dwellings, and may be considered as satisfactory bearing material of applicable class, subject to the following: a. The soil within the building area shall
    be explored using test pits. At least one test pit, penetrating at least eight feet below the level of the bottom of the proposed footings, shall be provided for every twenty-five hundred square feet of building area. Where such test pits consistently
    indicate that the fill is composed of material that is free of voids and free of extensive inclusions of mud, organic materials such as paper, garbage, cans, or metallic objects, and debris, the provisions of subparagraphs b and c of this paragraph
    shall apply. Where the test pits show such voids or inclusions, the additional provisions of subparagraph d of this paragraph shall apply. Borings may be used in lieu of test pits, provided that continuous samples at least four inches in diameter
    are recovered. b. The building area shall be additionally explored using one standard boring under each column. These borings shall be carried to a depth sufficient to penetrate into natural ground, but not less than twenty feet below grade, and a
    sufficient number shall penetrate deeper than twenty feet as required to meet the provisions of section 27-663 of article two of this subchapter. Where such borings show voids or inclusions, the provisions of subparagraph d of this paragraph shall
    apply. c. The allowable soil bearing pressure on the fill material shall not exceed two tons per square foot. d. Wherever the fill shows voids or inclusions as described in subparagraphs a and b of this paragraph either the fill shall be treated as
    having no presumptive bearing capacity, or the building shall incorporate adequate strength and stiffness to bridge such voids or inclusions or shall be articulated to prevent damage due to differential or localized settlement of the fill. (b) Organic
    silts, organic clays, soft inorganic clay, loose inorganic silt, and varved silt. (1) The allowable bearing pressure shall be determined independently of table 11-2 subject to the following: a. For varved silts, the soil bearing pressure produced
    by the proposed building shall not exceed two tons per square foot, except that for desiccated or preconsolidated soils, higher bearing pressures will be allowed. b. For organic silts or clays (groups OL and OH) or for soft or loose soils of groups
    ML, CL, MH, and CH, the soil bearing pressure produced by the proposed building shall not exceed one ton per square foot except that a value of two tons per square foot will be permitted on soils that are adequately preconsolidated or artificially
    treated. (2) The report required in this section shall contain, as a minimum, the following information: a. Geological profiles through the area defining the stratigraphy. b. Sufficient laboratory test data on the compressible material to indicate
    the coefficient of consolidation, coefficient of compressibility, permeability, secondary compression characteristics, and Atterberg limits. c. Where the design contemplates improvement of the natural bearing capacity and/or reduction in settlements
    by virtue of preloading, cross sections showing the amount of fill and surcharge to be placed on design details showing the required time for surcharging shall be indicated, and computations showing the amount of settlement to be expected during surcharging.
    Records of settlement plate elevations and pore pressure readings, before, during, and after surcharging, shall be filed with the commissioner. d. The estimated amount and rate of settlement expected to occur after the structure has been completed,
    including the influence of dead and live loads of the structure. e. A detailed analysis showing that the anticipated future settlement will not adversely affect the performance of the structure. f. Where sand drains are to be used, computations showing
    the diameter, spacing, and method of installation of such drains, shall be provided. (c) Artificially treated soils. Nominally unsatisfactory soil materials that are artificially compacted, cemented, or preconsolidated (including soils compacted by
    vibration, cemented by chemical injection, or preconsolidated by use of electric current, but not including cases where preconsolidation consists solely of the use of surcharge with or without sand drains) may be used for the support of buildings,
    and nominally satisfactory soil materials that are similarly treated may be used to resist soil bearing pressures in excess of those indicated in table 11-2 for the soil in its natural state, subject to the following: (1) The vertical and lateral
    extent of the soil that is compacted, cemented, or preconsolidated shall conform to the full extent of the distribution of loading that is assumed for purposes of computing the intensities of the soil bearing pressure. The actual soil bearing pressure
    shall not exceed the limitations of subdivisions (a) and (b) of this section for nominally unsatisfactory bearing materials or, for satisfactory bearing materials, shall not exceed the limitations of table 11-2. (2) After the treatment procedure,
    a minimum of one boring shall be made for every sixteen hundred square feet of that portion of the building area that is supported on treated soil, and a sufficient number of samples shall be recovered from the treated soil to demonstrate the efficacy
    of the treatment.</text>
