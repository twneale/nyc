  <text>ยง 27-665 Boring methods. Borings shall be made by continuous driving and cleaning out of a pipe casing (including telescoping of smaller sizes inside of larger casing) except as permitted in subdivisions (a), (b), and (c) of this section. Where casing
    is used, it shall be cleaned out to undisturbed soil prior to sampling and the sample spoon driven into soil that has not been affected by chopping, washing, or hydrostatic imbalance. (a) Uncased borings. Uncased borings, including borings where the
    casing is omitted for part of the depth, may be used if the mud slurry method is followed. The requirements for soil sampling and rock coring shall be the same for uncased borings as for borings made using casing, except that prior to each soil sampling
    operation the boring shall be substantially cleaned of disturbed material and the sample spoon shall be advanced through any settled solids before counting the blows required to drive the spoon. Longer sample spoons, having a sludge chamber, shall
    be used where settled solids exceed six inches In determining ground water levels, methods shall be used to reduce and replace the mud slurry so that the hydrostatic head may be measured. The procedures shall be described in detail in the records.
    (b) Auger borings. Borings may be made with augers except that short flight augers shall not be used in granular soils below the water level. Sampling procedures in auger borings for both soil and rock shall be the same as for cased borings. Full
    hydrostatic head shall be maintained in granular soils below the ground water level during the boring operation. (c) Maximum diameter. Where the bore hole, as drilled by any method, is in excess of four inches in diameter, sampling operations shall
    be performed through a temporary casing having a four inch inside diameter or less.</text>
