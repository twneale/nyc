  <text>ยง 27-686 Foundation walls. (a) Concrete. Concrete foundation walls shall be designed in accordance with the provisions of reference standard RS 10-3 relating to bearing or retaining walls. The equivalent unbraced height of a wall supported by lateral
    soil pressure may be determined by a recognized method of elastic analysis. Alternatively, such a wall may be assumed to be laterally braced at intervals as follows: (1) Where fill is placed against both faces of the walls: the full height of the
    wall or eight times the thickness, whichever is the lesser value. (2) Where both faces of the wall are not in contact with soil: the height of the unbraced section of the wall or eight times the thickness of the wall, whichever is greater, but not
    more than the full height of the wall. (b) Masonry. Masonry foundation walls shall conform to the provisions of reference standards RS 10-1 and RS 10-2, and the following: (1) TYPES. Masonry foundation walls may be of plain or reinforced masonry and
    shall be of solid units, except that load bearing hollow units will be permitted for support of one- and two-story buildings. (2) WALL THICKNESS. Foundation walls of masonry shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the provisions of reference
    standards RS 10-1 and RS 10-2, supplemented by the provisions of subdivision (a) of this section, relating to unbraced height. The thickness shall be at least six inches.</text>
