  <text>ยง 27-700 Allowable axial load. The allowable axial load on a pile shall be the least value permitted by consideration of the following factors (for battered piles, the axial load shall be computed from the resultant of all vertical loads and lateral
    forces occurring simultaneously): 1. The capacity of the pile as a structural member. 2. The allowable bearing pressure on soil strata underlying the pile tips. 3. The resistance to penetration of the piles, including resistance to driving, resistance
    to jacking, the rate of penetration, or other, equivalent criteria as established in this section. 4. The capacity as indicated by load test, where load tests are required. 5. The maximum loads prescribed in subdivision (e) of this section. (a) The
    capacity of the pile as a structural member. (1) EMBEDDED PORTION OF THE PILE. The compressive stress on any cross section of a pile produced by that portion of the design load that is considered to be transmitted to that section shall not exceed
    the allowable values for the construction materials as established in table 11-3. The tensile stress shall not exceed the values established in subchapter ten of this chapter for like material. (2) PORTION OF THE PILE THAT IS NOT EMBEDDED. That portion
    of any pile that is free standing in air or water shall be designed as a column in accordance with the provisions of subchapter ten of this chapter, fixed at a point five feet below the soil contact level in class 8-65 material or better and ten feet
    below in any other material. The conditions of lateral and rotational restraint offered by the pile cap shall be considered in determining the equivalent unbraced length. (3) LOAD DISTRIBUTION ALONG EMBEDDED PORTION OF THE PILE. The portion of the
    design load acting on any cross-section of a pile may be determined by analysis, considering time dependent changes in distribution of the load. As an alternative method for the purposes of this section, it may be assumed that: a. For piles embedded
    forty feet or more in materials of class 10-65 or better, or in controlled fills, and bearing on or in materials of classes 1-65 to 5-65: seventy-five per cent of the load shall be assumed to be carried by the tip. For shorter piles, with similar
    conditions of embedment and bearing, one hundred per cent of the load shall be assumed carried by the tip. b. For piles embedded in materials of class 10-65 or better, or in controlled fills, and bearing on or in materials of classes 6-65 to 10-65
    (or controlled fills): the full load shall be assumed to act at a cross section located at two-thirds of the embedded length of the pile measured up from the tip. Where tapered piles are used, the stress at all sections of the pile shall be determined
    on the basis that the full load acts at a location as described above and that one-third of the full load acts at the tip. The stresses so computed shall not exceed the allowable values in table 11-3. c. For conditions not covered in subparagraphs
    a and b of this paragraph three the provisions relating to analysis shall apply. Table 11-3 Allowable Compressive Stress for Pile Materials ======================================================================== Pile Material Allowable Compressive
    Stress ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Concrete Concrete--The provisions of Reference Standard RS 10-3 relating to short compression members shall apply. For working stress design use 0.25f'c. For ultimate
    strength design use minimum eccentricity of 5 per cent, phi = 0.70 (phi = 0.75 where a permanent metal shell having a minimum wall thickness of 1/8 inch is used), and load factors as specified in Reference Standard RS 10-3. The above provisions shall
    be deemed applicable to reinforced and unreinforced sections. For unreinforced sections use Ds = D and d = t (symbols refer to those used in Reference Standard RS 10-3). Reinforcing steel--0.40fy but not greater than 30,000 psi. (The provisions of
    article five of subchapter ten of this chapter relating to ties, spirals, and percentages of reinforcing steel for reinforced concrete compression members shall apply.) Timber See timber piles (section 27-707 of article eight of this subchapter) Steel
    H piles--0.35fy, with fy not to be taken as greater than 36,000 psi. Minimum thickness of metal shall be 0.40. Pipe piles, shells for cast-in place concrete piles and shells of pipe sections used in caisson piles: 0.35fy, (fy not to be taken as greater
    than 36,000 psi.) for thickness of 1/8 in. or more. Metal thinner than 1/8 in. shall not be considered as contributing to the structural strength of the pile section. Core sections for caisson piles: 0.50fy with fy not to be taken as greater than
    36,000 psi. ======================================================================== Note: f'c = 28 day compressive strength of concrete. fy = Minimum specified yield strength of steel. (b) Allowable bearing pressure on soil strata underlying the
    pile tips. (1) BEARING CAPACITY. The allowable pile load shall be limited by the provision that the pressures in materials at and below the pile tips, produced by the loads on individual piles and by the aggregate of all piles in a group or foundation,
    shall not exceed the allowable bearing values established in article four of this subchapter. The provisions of section 27-678 and 27-679 of article four of this subchapter shall apply. The transfer of load from piles to soil shall be determined by
    a recognized method of analysis. As an alternative, for purposes of this section, piles or pile groups may be assumed to transfer their loads to the underlying materials by spreading the load uniformly at an angle of sixty degrees with the horizontal,
    starting at a polygon circumscribing the piles, located as follows: a. For piles embedded entirely in materials of classes 4-65 to 8-65, or in controlled fill materials, the polygon shall be circumscribed at a level located two-thirds of the embedded
    length of the pile, measured up from the tip. b. For piles penetrating through soils of classes 9-65, 10-65, or 11-65 into bearing in soils of class 8-65 or better, the polygon shall be circumscribed at the bottom of the strata of class 9-65, 10-65
    or 11-65 materials. c. In the case of piles having enlarged bases, the lateral distribution of the load to the soil may be assumed to begin at the junction of the shaft and the enlarged base and to extend as follows: 1. In the case where the enlarged
    base is formed in loose or medium compact (N value less than thirty) soils of class 6-65 or 7-65 that extend twenty feet or more below the junction of the base and shaft, or that are of lesser extent but are directly underlain by soil of class 5-65
    or better, the bearing area may be taken at a plane six feet below said junction but not lower than the bottom of the soil strata of class 6-65 or 7-65. 2. Where the enlarged base is formed in compact (N value thirty to sixty) soils of class 6-65
    or 7-65, or in any soil of these classes that extends less than twenty feet below the junction of the base and the shaft and that is underlain by soil of class 8-65 or poorer, the bearing area shall be taken at planes less than six feet below said
    junction, with a lower limit of three feet where the material is very compact (N value sixty, or greater) and the extent of the class 6-65 or 7-65 material is ten feet below the junction of shaft and base. (The provisions of subdivision (e) of section
    27-710 of article ten of this subchapter relating to minimum depth of bearing stratum below the junction of base and shaft shall apply.) For conditions intermediate between that described in clause one of this subparagraph and the lower limit conditions
    described here, the location of the bearing area may be determined by linear interpolation between the indicated limits of N value and extent of bearing material below the junction of shaft and base, giving equal weight to both variables. 3. Where
    the enlarged base is formed in or on soils of class 4-65 or 5-65, the bearing area shall be taken at a depth below the junction of the shaft and base consonant with the size and depth of the base formed, and as evaluated from the required test piles.
    d. For all piles bearing on soils of classes 1-65 to 3-65, analysis of load distribution will not be required if the requirements relating to capacity of the pile as a structural member, to resistance to penetration, to load test where required, and
    to maximum tabulated loads are satisfied. e. For piles bearing in soils of classes 9-65 and 10-65, for cases not described above, or for any case where the method of installing the pile utilizes a temporary casing, the provision relating to analysis
    shall apply. f. In no case shall the area considered as supporting the load extend beyond the intersection of the sixty degree planes of adjacent piles or pile groups. (2) BEARING STRATUM. The plans for the proposed work shall establish, in accordance
    with the requirements relating to allowable bearing pressure, the bearing strata to which the piles in the various sections of the building are to be penetrated and the approximate elevations of the top of such bearing strata. Where penetration of
    a given distance into the bearing strata is required for adequate distribution of the loads, such penetration shall be shown on the plans. The indicated elevations of the top of the bearing strata shall be modified by such additional data as may be
    obtained during construction. All piles shall penetrate to or into the designated bearing strata. (c) Capacity as indicated by resistance to penetration. Where subsurface investigation, as described in article two of this subchapter, or general experience
    in the area, indicates that the soil that must be penetrated by the pile consists of glacial deposits containing boulders, or fills containing riprap, excavated detritus, masonry, concrete, or other obstructions in sufficient numbers to present a
    hazard to the installation of the piles, the selection of type of pile and penetration criteria shall be subject to the approval of the commissioner but in no case shall the minimum penetration resistance be less than that stipulated in Tables 11-4
    and 11-5. (For Table 11-4 see chapter 839 of the laws of 1986) Notes: a Final driving resistance shall be the sum of tabulated values plus resistance exerted by non-bearing materials. The driving resistance of non-bearing materials shall be taken
    as the resistance experienced by the pile during driving, but which will be dissipated with time and may be approximated as described in subparagraph a of paragraph one of subdivision (c) of this section. b The hammer energy indicated is the rated
    energy. c Sustained driving resistance--where piles are to bear in soil classes 4-65 and 5-65, the minimum driving resistance shall be maintained for the last six inches, unless a higher sustained driving resistance requirement is established by load
    test. Where piles are to bear in soil classes 6-65 through 10-65, the minimum driving resistance shall be maintained for the last twelve inches unless load testing demonstrates a requirement for higher sustained driving resistance. No pile need be
    driven to a resistance to penetration (in blows per inch) more than twice the resistance indicated in this table, nor beyond the point at which there is no measurable net penetration under the hammer blow. d The tabulated values assume that the ratio
    of total weight of pile to weight of striking part of hammer does not exceed 3.5. If a larger ratio is to be used, or for other conditions for which no values are tabulated, the driving resistance shall be as approved by the commissioner. e For intermediate
    values of pile capacity, minimum requirements for driving resistance may be determined by straight line interpolation. Table 11-5 Minimum Driving Resistance and Hammer Energy for Timber Piles ========================================================================
    Minimum Driving Resistance (blows-in.) to be added to driving resistance Hammer Pile Capacity exerted by non-bearing Energy (tons) materials {1}, {3}, {4} (ft.-lbs.){2} ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Up to
    20 Formula in Note {4} shall apply 7,500-12,000 Over 20 to 25 9,000-12,000 14,000-16,000 Over 25 to 30 12,000-16,000 (single-acting hammers) 15,000-20,000 (double-acting hammers) Greater than 30 ========================================================================
    Notes: {1} The driving resistance exerted by non-bearing materials is the resistance experienced by the pile during driving, but which will be dissipated with time and may be approximated as described in subparagraph a of paragraph one of subdivision
    (c) of this section. {2} The hammer energy indicated is the rated energy. {3} Sustained driving resistance. Where piles are to bear in soil classes 4-65 and 5-65, the minimum driving resistance shall be maintained for the last six inches, unless a
    higher sustained driving resistance requirement is established by load test. Where piles are to bear in soil classes 6-65 thru 10-65, the minimum driving resistance measured in blows per inch shall be maintained for the last twelve inches unless load
    testing demonstrates a requirement for higher sustained driving resistance. No pile need be driven to a resistance to penetration (in blows per inch) more than twice the resistance indicated in this table nor beyond the point at which there is no
    measurable net penetration under the hammer blow. {4} The minimum driving resistance shall be determined by the following formula: (For Equations see chapter 907 of the laws of 1985) (1) PILES INSTALLED BY USE OF STEAM-POWERED, AIR-POWERED, DIESEL-POWERED
    OR HYDRAULIC IMPACT HAMMERS. a. The minimum required driving resistance and the requirements for hammer energies for various types and capacities of piles are given in tables 11-4 and 11-5. To obtain the required total driving resistance, the indicated
    driving resistances shall be added to any driving resistance experienced by the pile during installation, but which will be dissipated with time (resistance exerted by non-bearing materials or by materials which are to be excavated). For purposes
    of this section, the resistance exerted by non-bearing materials may be approximated as the resistance to penetration of the pile recorded when the pile has penetrated to the bottom of the lowest stratum of nominally unsatisfactory bearing material
    (class 11-65, but not controlled fill) or to the bottom of the lowest stratum of soft or loose deposits of class 9-65 or 10-65 but only where such strata are completely penetrated by the pile. The provisions of articles nine and ten of this subchapter
    shall also apply. b. Alternate for similitude method. The requirement for installation of piling to the penetration resistances given in tables 11-4 and 11-5 will be waived where the following five conditions prevail: 1. The piles bear on, or in,
    soil of class 5-65 through class 10-65. 2. The stratigraphy, as defined by not less than one boring for every sixteen hundred square feet of building area, shall be reasonably uniform or divisible into areas of uniform conditions. 3. Regardless of
    pile type or capacity, one load test, as described in subdivision (d) of this section, shall be conducted in each area of uniform conditions, but not less than two typical piles for the entire foundation installation of the building or group of buildings
    on the site, nor less than one pile for every fifteen thousand square feet of pile foundation area shall be load tested. 4. Except as permitted by the provisions of clause six of this subparagraph, all building piles within the area of influence of
    a given load-tested pile of satisfactory performance shall be installed to the same or greater driving resistance as the successful load-tested pile. The same or heavier equipment of the same type that was used to install the load-tested pile shall
    be used to install all other building piles, and the equipment shall be operated identically. Also, all other piles shall be of the same type, shape, external dimension, and equal or greater cross-section as the load-tested pile. All building piles
    within the area of influence represented by a given satisfactory load-tested pile shall bear in, or on the same bearing stratum as the load test pile. 5. A report by an architect or engineer shall be submitted establishing to the satisfaction of the
    commissioner, that the soil bearing pressures do not exceed the values permitted by the provisions of article four of this subchapter and that the probable differential settlements will not cause stress conditions in the building in excess of those
    permitted by the provisions of subchapter ten of this chapter. 6. Where the structure of the building or the spacing and length of the piling is such as to cause the building and its foundation to act as an essentially rigid body, the building piles
    may be driven to length and/or penetration into the bearing stratum without regard to penetration resistance, subject to the requirement of clause five of this subparagraph, relating to submission of report. (2) PILES INSTALLED BY JACKING OR OTHER
    STATIC FORCES. The carrying capacity of a pile installed by jacking or other static forces shall be not more than fifty per cent of the load or force used to install the pile to the required penetration, except for piles jacked into position for underpinning.
    The working load of a temporary underpinning pile shall not exceed the total jacking force at final penetration. The working load of each permanent underpinning pile shall not exceed the larger of the following values: two-thirds of the total jacking
    force used to obtain the required penetration if the load is held constant for seven hours without measurable settlement; or one-half of the total jacking force at final penetration if the load is held for a period of one hour without measurable settlement.
    The jacking resistance used to determine the working load shall not include the resistance offered by non-bearing materials which will be dissipated with time. (3) PILES INSTALLED BY USE OF VIBRATORY HAMMER. The capacity of piles installed by vibratory
    hammer shall not exceed the value established on the principle of similitude, as follows: a. Comparison piles, as required by the provisions of subdivision (d) of this section, shall be installed using an impact hammer and driving resistances corresponding
    to the proposed pile capacities as determined in paragraph one of subdivision (c) of this section or to tip elevations and driving resistances as determined by the architect or engineer. b. For each comparison pile, install an identical index pile
    by use of the vibratory hammer at a location at least four feet, but not more than six feet, from each comparison pile. The index piles shall be installed to the same tip elevation as the comparison pile, except that where the comparison piles bear
    on soils of classes 1-65 to 5-65, the index piles shall bear in, or on, similar material. All driving data for the index pile shall be recorded. c. The index piles shall be load tested in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (d) of this section.
    Should the specified load test criteria indicate inadequate capacity of the index piles, steps a, b, and c shall be repeated using longer, larger, or other types of piles. d. All building piles within the area of influence of a given, satisfactorily
    tested index pile shall be installed to the same or lesser rate of penetration (in. per min.) as of the successful index pile. The same equipment that was used to install the index pile, identically operated as to rpm, manifold pressure, etc., shall
    be used to install the building piles. Also, all building piles shall be of the same type, size, and shape as the index pile. All building piles within the area of influence as represented by a given satisfactorily tested index pile shall bear in,
    or on, the same bearing stratum as the index pile. Table 11-6 Basic Maximum Pile Loads ======================================================================== Basic maximum pile load Type of pile (tons) ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Caisson piles No upper limit Open-end pipe (or tube) piles bearing 18 in. O.D. and greater--250 on rock of classes 1-65, 2-65, and 3-65 less than 18 in. O.D.--200 Closed-end pipe (or tube) piles, H 150 piles, cast-in-place concrete and com- pacted
    concrete piles bearing on rock of classes 1-65, 2-65 and 3-65 Piles (other than timber piles) bearing on soft rock (class 4-65) 1) Displacement piles such as pipe, cast-in-place concrete, and com- pacted concrete piles 60 2) Non-displacement piles

    required as follows: (1) PILES INSTALLED BY STATIC FORCES. The load bearing capacity of all types and capacities of piles installed by static forces, other than caisson piles and underpinning piles, shall be demonstrated by load test. (2) PILES DRIVEN
    BY IMPACT HAMMERS. The load bearing capacity of piles installed by impact hammers shall be demonstrated by load test when the proposed pile capacity exceeds the following values: a. Caisson piles.--No load test required. b. Piles installed open end
    to rock of class 1-65, 2-65 or 3-65-- one hundred tons, except as provided in subparagraph d of this paragraph, and except that no load tests will be required for piles up to two hundred tons capacity wherein the pile load does not exceed eighty per
    cent of the load determined on the basis of limiting stresses in the pile materials and provided that the pipe or shell be driven to the resistance indicated in table 11--4. c. Piles bearing on rock or hardpan (soil classes 1-65 to 5-65) other than
    as described in subparagraph b of this paragraph, and except as provided in subparagraph d of this paragraph--forty tons. d. Piles bearing on materials of class eight or better, wherein, on the assumption that one hundred per cent of the load reaches
    the pile tip, (or, in case of piles having an enlarged base or other enlargement of the bearing area, the top of the enlargement) the bearing pressure on the soil underlying the tips or bases can be demonstrated to be equal to or less than the values
    of basic allowable pressure indicated in table 11-2--provided that the class and density of the bearing material supporting the piles be confirmed by not less than one boring at each column location, then the commissioner may reduce the required number
    of load tests. e. All other types of piles--thirty tons. (3) PILES INSTALLED BY USE OF VIBRATORY HAMMERS. The load bearing capacity of all types and capacities of piles (other than caisson piles) shall be demonstrated by load test. (4) LOAD TEST PROCEDURES.
    Before any load test is made, the proposed apparatus and structure to be used in making the load test shall be satisfactory to the commissioner and when required by him or her, all load tests shall be made under the commissioner's surveillance or
    that of his or her representative. A complete record of such tests shall be filed with the commissioner. a. Areas of the foundation site within which the subsurface soil conditions are substantially similar in character shall be established. In addition,
    for friction piles bearing on, or on, soil materials of class 6-65, or poorer, the uniformity of each such area shall be verified by installing at least three penetration-test piles, distributed over the area. Continuous records of penetration resistance
    shall be made for such piles. If the records of penetration resistance are not similar or are not in reasonable agreement with the information obtained from the borings, the assumed areas of similar subsurface conditions shall be modified in accordance
    with the information derived from the penetration-test piles and additional penetration-test piles shall be installed as required to verify the uniformity of such areas. b. For piles installed by jacking or other static forces or by impact hammer,
    one load test shall be conducted in each area of uniform conditions, but not less than two typical piles for the entire foundation installation of the building or group of buildings on the site, and not less than one pile for each fifteen thousand
    square feet of the area of the building wherein said piles are to be used shall be load tested. For piles installed by use of vibratory hammers, one comparison pile shall be installed and one index pile shall be load tested in each area of uniform
    conditions, but not less than two index piles shall be tested for the entire foundation installation of the building or group of buildings on the site, nor less than one index pile be tested for every seventy-five hundred square feet of pile foundation
    area. For piles whose capacity is determined on the basis of similitude, the provisions of subparagraph b of paragraph one of subdivision (c) of this section shall apply. c. The load test shall be conducted by a method that will maintain constant
    load under increasing settlement. Settlement observations shall be made by means of dial extensometers. The extensometers shall provide readings to the nearest one one-thousandth of an inch. In addition, settlement observations shall be taken using
    an engineer's level reading to one one-thousandth of a foot, properly referenced to a well-established benchmark. 1. Test loads shall be applied by direct weight or by means of a hydraulic jack. The loading platform or box shall be carefully constructed
    to provide a concentric load on the pile. If direct weight is employed, the loading increments shall be applied without impact or jar. The weight of the loading platform or box shall be obtained prior to the test and this weight shall be considered
    as the first increment of load. If a hydraulic jack is employed, facilities for maintaining each increment of desired load constant under increasing settlement shall be provided. The gauge and the jack shall be calibrated as a unit for each project.
    2. The test load shall be twice the proposed working load of the pile. The test load shall be applied in seven increments at a load of fifty per cent, seventy-five per cent, one hundred per cent, one hundred twenty-five per cent, one hundred fifty
    per cent, one hundred seventy-five per cent, and two hundred per cent of the proposed working load. After the proposed working load has been applied and for each increment thereafter, the test load shall remain in place until there is no measurable
    settlement in a two hour period. The total test load shall remain in place until settlement does not exceed one one-thousandth of a foot in forty-eight hours. The total load shall be removed in decrements not exceeding twenty-five per cent of the
    total load at one hour intervals or longer. The rebound shall be recorded after each decrement is removed, and the final rebound shall be recorded twenty-four hours after the entire test load has been removed. 3. Under each load increment, settlement
    observations shall be made and recorded at one-half minute, one minute, two minutes, four minutes, and each four minutes thereafter after application of load increment, except in the instance of the total load where, after the four minute reading,
    the time interval shall be successively doubled until the final settlement limitation is reached and the load is removed. 4. The allowable pile load shall be the lesser of the two values computed as follows: (a) Fifty (50) per cent of the applied
    load causing a net settlement of the pile of not more than one one-hundredth of an inch per ton of applied load. Net settlement in this paragraph means gross settlement due to the total test load minus the rebound after removing one hundred per cent
    of the test load. (b) Fifty (50) per cent of the applied load causing a net settlement of the pile of three-quarters of an inch. Net settlement in this paragraph means the gross settlement as defined in subclause (a) of clause 4 of this subparagraph,
    less the amount of elastic shortening in the pile section due to total test load. (5) FOUNDATION PILES. Except as provided in clause six of subparagraph b of paragraph one of subdivision (c) of this section, all building piles within the area of influence
    of a given load-tested pile of satisfactory performance, shall be installed to the same or greater penetration resistance (or static load) as the successful load-tested pile. The same equipment (or heavier equipment of the same type) that was used
    to install the load-tested pile shall be used to install all other building piles, and the equipment shall be operated identically. Also all other piles shall be of the same type, shape, external dimension, and equal or greater cross section as the
    load-tested pile. All building piles within the area of influence represented by a given satisfactory load-tested pile shall bear in, or on the same bearing stratum as the load-tested pile. For friction piles where the actual pile lengths vary more
    than fifty per cent from that of the test pile, the commissioner may require investigation to determine the adequacy of the piles. (6) PILE GROUPS. When the commissioner has reasons to doubt the safe load sustaining capacity of pile groups, he or
    she may require at the expense of the owner, group load tests up to one hundred fifty per cent of the proposed group load. (7) "CASING-OFF." Any temporary supporting capacity that the soil might provide to the pile during a load test, but which would
    be dissipated with time, shall be obviated by "casing-off" or by other suitable means. For purposes of this section, temporary supporting capacity shall include the resistances offered by any strata of nominally unsatisfactory bearing materials (class
    11-65, other than controlled fill) or of soft or loose deposits of class 9-65 or 10-65 that are completely penetrated by the pile, or any resistance offered by granular soils that will be dissipated by reason of vibration. (e) Maximum loads. (1) BASIC
    MAXIMUM LOADS. Except as permitted by the provisions of paragraph two of this subdivision, the maximum allowable pile load, determined in accordance with the provisions of subdivisions (a) through (d) of this section, shall not exceed the values specified
    in table 11-6. (2) SUBSTANTIATION OF HIGHER ALLOWABLE LOADS. The pile capacities tabulated in table 11-6 may be exceeded where a higher value can be substantiated on the basis of test and analysis, as follows: a. Load tests. The provisions of subdivision
    (d) of this section shall be supplemented, as follows: 1. Not less than one single-pile load test shall be conducted for each ten thousand square feet of pile foundation area. 2. Final load increment shall remain in place for a total of not less than
    ninety-six hours. 3. Single test piles shall be subjected to cyclical loading or suitably instrumented so that the movements of the pile tip and butt may be independently determined. Other alternate methods or devices, acceptable to the commissioner
    which will permit evaluation of the transfer of load from piles to soil may be used. 4. Where the commissioner deems necessary, the provisions of paragraph six of subdivision (d) of this section relating to group load tests shall apply. If required,
    group load tests shall be performed in groups of numerically average size. Except where the proposed foundation is limited to single and/or two pile groups, each test group shall contain not less than three piles. 5. Individual pile loadings shall
    not exceed those determined from the single pile load tests. 6. The provisions of paragraph two of subdivision (d) of this section shall apply. b. Analysis and report. A report shall be submitted by the architect or engineer establishing to the satisfaction
    of the commissioner (on the basis of soil and load tests and foundation analysis, including analysis of the group action of the piles) that the proposed construction under a one hundred per cent overload of the foundation is safe against failure of
    the pile and soil materials, and showing that the probable total magnitude and distribution of settlement to be expected under design conditions will not result in instability of the building or stresses in the structure in excess of the allowable
    values established in subchapter ten of this chapter. c. Penetration resistance. The penetration resistance shall not be less than that required by the provisions of subdivision (c) of this section or, where applicable values are not indicated therein,
    shall be determined from the required load tests. The pile material shall be capable of withstanding the driving stresses without being damaged. (f) Combination of loads. The provisions of section 27-594 of subchapter ten of this chapter shall apply.</text>
