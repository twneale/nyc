  <text>ยง 27-701 Allowable lateral load. For plumb piles fully embedded in the ground, the lateral load applied at the top of the pile shall not exceed one ton per pile unless it has been demonstrated by tests that the pile will resist a lateral load of two
    hundred per cent of the proposed working lateral load without lateral movement of more than one inch at the ground level and will resist the proposed working lateral load without a movement of more than three-eighths of an inch at the ground level.
    For piles projecting above the ground level the shear and bending stresses computed on the basis of cantilever action to a level of five feet below grade in soils of class 8-65 or better and to ten feet below grade in poorer soils shall not exceed
    the allowable values for like materials established in subchapter ten of this chapter. The provisions of subdivision (f) of section 27-700 of this article relating to combination of loads shall apply.</text>
