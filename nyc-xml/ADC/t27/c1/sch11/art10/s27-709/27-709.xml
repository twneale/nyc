  <text>ยง 27-709 Cast-in-place concrete piles. (a) Description. Cast-in-place concrete piles shall be cast in shells previously installed in the ground or, with the limitations indicated in section 27-697 of article seven of this subchapter, may be cast in
    an uncased hole. Cast-in-place piles may be tapered or cylindrical, or a combination of tapered and cylindrical shapes. (b) Materials. Concrete for cast-in-place concrete piles shall conform to the requirements of article five of subchapter ten of
    this chapter. Slump shall be five inches plus or minus one inch. Where the pile shell is assumed to contribute to the capacity of the pile as a structural member, the shell shall be of metal and shall conform to the provisions of article six of subchapter
    ten of this chapter or section 27-712 of this article. Where the pile shell is not assumed to contribute to the capacity of the pile as a structural member, the shell may be of any material that will adequately resist the driving stresses and maintain
    an open well to receive the concrete. End closures for shells shall not project more than one-half inch beyond the outer limits of the pile when bearing in soils of class 6-65 or lower. (c) Installation. (1) After installation to final depth and immediately
    before filling with concrete, the inside of the tube, shell, or bore shall be thoroughly cleaned to the bottom and inspected by lowering a drop light or by means of a light beam. To be accepted: (a) the pile shall be free of collapsed sections of
    shell and the pile shell shall not show any tears; (b) the pile shall be free of water except that a minor amount of water may be allowed to occur in the pile if it be absorbed by placing a suitable amount of dry cement-sand mixture in the tip end
    of the pile; and (c) the alignment of the pile shall conform to the provisions of section 27-691 of article seven of this subchapter. If the bottom of the casing is out of sight, the shape and alignment of the casing shall be surveyed with a suitable
    instrument, or the pile rejected. (2) Concrete shall be placed by such methods that the entire volume of the tube, shell, or bore is filled and in a manner that will preclude separation of the ingredients. (3) No concrete shall be placed in a cast-in-place
    pile until all piles within a radius of fifteen feet, or within the heave range, have been driven. (4) Rejected pile shells shall be filled with concrete or sand. (5) The concrete cap shall not be placed until at least one hour after all piles within
    the cap group are completely filled.</text>
