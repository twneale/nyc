    installed open-end and having a nominal outside diameter of less than fourteen inches shall be at least one-quarter inch thick. For diameters from fourteen inches to eighteen inches, the minimum thickness shall be 0.310 in. For diameters over eighteen
    inches, the minimum thickness shall be 0.375 in. (2) Steel pipe piles installed with ends closed shall have a minimum nominal wall thickness of at least 0.125 in. (3) For piles which receive their principal support by friction, closure or splice plates
    shall not project more than three-eighths of an inch beyond the outer limit of the pipe section. (c) Installation. (1) Pipe shells driven open-end shall be cleaned to the bottom of the shell after driving. (2) After driving and cleaning the pipe,
    open-end piles driven to end bearing on rock or hardpan shall be reseated to full bearing by redriving, to the resistance indicated in table 11-4. If the pipe shell shows two inches or more of penetration on redriving, the pipe shall be recleaned
    and redriven in successive cycles until the penetration on redriving is less than two inches. (3) Pipe shells shall be inspected before filling with concrete, shall be clean, and shall meet the requirements for alignment and condition of the shell
    as specified with regard to the shells of cast-in-place piles. If leakage of water into the pipe occurs, the provisions of paragraph five of subdivision (e) of section 27-713 of this article shall apply. (4) Placing of concrete fill in pipe shells
