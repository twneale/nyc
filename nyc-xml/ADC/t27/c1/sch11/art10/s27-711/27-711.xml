    of the section are adequately connected to develop the strength of the adjacent components and if the ratio of width to thickness of the component parts does not exceed the values for conventional "H" sections. (b) Limitations on use. The tips of
    all steel H piles having a thickness of metal less than one-half inch, which are driven to end bearing on rock of class 1-65 through 3-65 by an impact hammer, shall be reinforced. The installation of all steel H piles by impact hammer to end bearing
    on rock of classes 1-65 through 3-65 shall be under the personal inspection of an architect or engineer, and the operations of driving such piles, the observations of penetration resistance, and the operation of the equipment shall be conducted so
    as to terminate driving directly when the pile reaches refusal on the rock surface.</text>
