  <text>ยง 27-661 Construction. The provisions of subchapter nineteen of this chapter relating to safety and of subchapter ten of this chapter relating to concrete, timber, masonry, and steel construction shall apply. For inspection requirements, see article
    thirteen of this subchapter. (a) Cold weather. No foundation shall be placed on frozen soil. No foundation shall be placed in freezing weather unless provision is made to maintain the underlying soil free of frost. (b) Seepage. In an excavation where
    soil and ground water conditions are such that an inward or upward seepage might be produced in soil material intended to provide vertical or lateral support for foundation elements or for adjacent foundations, excavating methods that will control
    or prevent the inflow of ground water shall be employed to prevent disturbance of the soil material in the excavation or beneath existing buildings. No foundation shall be laid on soil that has been disturbed by seepage unless remedial measures, as
    directed by an architect or engineer, are taken.</text>
