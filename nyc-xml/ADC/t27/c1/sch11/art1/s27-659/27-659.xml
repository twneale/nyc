  <text>ยง 27-659 Foundations at different levels. Where footings are supported at different levels, or at different levels from the footings of adjacent structures, the influence of the pressures under the higher footings on the stability of the lower footings
    shall be considered. Consideration shall be given to the requirements for lateral support of the material supporting the higher footings, the additional load imposed on the lower footings, and assessment of the effects of dragdown on adjacent pile-supported
    buildings.</text>
