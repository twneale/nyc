  <text>ยง 27-716 Use of rock support in lieu of underpinning. Existing structures founded at a level above the level of adjacent new construction may be supported on hard rock in lieu of underpinning, the use of sheeting and bracing, or the construction of
    retaining walls, provided that a report by the architect or engineer is submitted substantiating the safety of the proposed construction and verifying that an "in-place" inspection has been made of the rock exposed and of the jointing therein in the
    excavation.</text>
