  <text>ยง 27-704 Equipment. (a) General. The hammer shall travel freely in the leads. The cushion or cap block shall be replaced, if crushed. The hammer shall deliver its rated energy, and measurements shall be made of the fall of the ram or other suitable
    data shall be observed at intervals as required to verify the actual energy delivered at the termination of driving. (b) Cushion or cap block. The cushion or cap block shall be a solid block of hardwood with its grains parallel to the axis of the
    pile and enclosed in a tight-fitting steel housing, or shall be an equivalent assemblage. If laminated materials are used, the type and construction of these materials shall be such that their strength is equal to, or greater than, hardwood. Wood
    chips, pieces of rope, hose, shavings, or automobile tires and similar materials shall not be used. Cap blocks shall be replaced if burned, crushed, or otherwise damaged. (c) Followers. Followers shall not be used unless permitted in writing by the
    architect or engineer, and only when necessary to accomplish such installation. They shall be of steel or hardwood of such size, shape, length, and weight as to permit driving the pile in the desired location and to the required depth and resistance.
    The required driving resistance tabulated in Tables 11-4 and 11-5 shall be increased to compensate for the loss of energy in the hammer blow. The follower shall be a single length section, shall be provided with a socket or hood carefully fitted to
    the top of the pile to minimize loss of energy and to prevent damage to the pile, and shall have sufficient rigidity to prevent "whip" during driving.</text>
