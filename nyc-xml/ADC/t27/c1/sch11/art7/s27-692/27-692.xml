  <text>ยง 27-692 Minimum spacing of piles. Piles shall be spaced to meet the following requirements: (1) Spacing of piles shall provide for adequate distribution of the load on the pile group to the supporting soil, in accordance with the provisions of subdivision
    (b) of section 27-700 of article eight of this subchapter. (2) In no case shall the minimum center-to-center spacing of piles be less than twenty-four inches, nor less than the values for specific types of piling as indicated in article ten of this
    subchapter. Unless special measures are taken to assure that piles will penetrate sufficiently to meet the requirements of section 27-689 of this article without interfering with or intersecting each other, the minimum center-to-center spacing of
    piles shall be twice the average diameter of the butt for round piles; one and three-quarters times the diagonal for rectangular piles; or, for taper piles, twice the diameter at a level two-thirds of the pile length measured up from the tip. In cases
    of practical difficulty, the spacing of new piles from existing piles under an adjacent building may be less than the above values provided that the requirements relating to minimum embedment and pile interference are satisfied and that the soil under
    the proposed and existing buildings is not overloaded by the closer pile grouping.</text>
