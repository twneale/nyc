  <text>ยง 27-698 Where more than one pile type, pile capacity, or method of pile installation is used. Wherever it is proposed to: (1) construct a foundation for a building utilizing piles of more than one type or capacity; (2) modify an existing foundation
    by the addition of piles of a type or capacity other than those of the existing piling; (3) construct or modify a foundation utilizing different methods or more than one method of installation, or using different types or capacities of equipment (such
    as different types of hammers having markedly different striking energies or speeds); or (4) support part of a building on piles and part on footings, the several parts of the building supported on the different types, capacities, or modes of piling
    shall be separated by suitable joints providing for differential movement, or a report shall be submitted by the architect or engineer establishing to the satisfaction of the commissioner that the proposed construction is adequate and safe, and showing
    that the probable settlements and differential settlements to be expected will not result in instability of the building or stresses in the structure in excess of the allowable values established in subchapter ten of this chapter. The provisions of
    subdivision (d) of section 27-700 of article eight of this subchapter relating to required load tests shall apply separately and distinctly to each different type or capacity of piling, method of installation, or type or capacity of equipment used,
    except where analysis of the probable, comparative behavior of the different types or capacities of the piles or the methods of installation indicates that data on one type or capacity of pile permits a reliable extrapolation of the probable behavior
    of the piles of other types and capacities.</text>
