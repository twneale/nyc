  <text>ยง 27-695 Splicing of piles. Splices shall be constructed so as to provide and maintain true alignment and position of the component parts of the pile during installation and subsequent thereto, and shall be of adequate strength to transmit the vertical
    and lateral loads (including tensions) and the moments occurring in the pile section at the location of the splice without exceeding the allowable stresses for such materials as established in subdivision (a) of section 27-700 of article eight of
    this subchapter. Except for piles which can be visually inspected after driving, splices shall develop at least fifty per cent of the capacity of the pile in bending. In addition, all pile splices in the upper ten feet of the pile section shall be
    capable of resisting (at allowable working stresses) the moment and shear that would result from an assumed eccentricity of the pile load of three inches, or the pile shall be braced in accordance with the provisions of section 27-694 of article seven
    of this subchapter to other piles that do not have splices in the upper ten feet of embedment. For piles located near a lot line, the embedded length of such piles shall be determined on the basis that the adjacent site will be excavated to a depth
    of ten feet below the nearest established curb level.</text>
