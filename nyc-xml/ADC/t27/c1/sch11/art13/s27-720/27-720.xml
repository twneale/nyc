  <text>§ 27-720 Boring and test pit operations. Boring and test pit operations shall be subject to controlled inspection, except that fifty per cent or less of the required number of borings and/or test pits may be inspected by an architect or engineer other
    than the architect or engineer designated for controlled inspection. The records of borings and/or test pits shall be attested to as follows: (a) The architect or engineer shall file a report stating which borings and/or test pits were performed under
    his or her inspection and whether such inspection was performed personally or otherwise. If the inspection was not made personally by the architect or engineer, the name and address of the inspector shall be noted. It shall be stated: that the borings
    and/or test pits so inspected were made and were carried to the depths indicated; that, to the best of the architect's or engineer's knowledge and belief, the description and classification of the soils are a true description of the samples recovered
    from the respective borings and/or test pits; that such samples were recovered at the levels indicated; and that the boring and/or test pit work progressed in such manner that the samples recovered are reasonably representative of the subsurface conditions.
    (b) The accuracy of the other data indicated on the boring records shall be attested to by the drilling contractor or by the driller making the borings.</text>
