    fine particles subject to spontaneous ignition; uses that employ solids or substances that ignite or produce flammable gases on contact with water; and any other uses that constitute a high fire hazard because of the form, character, or volume of
    the materials involved. (a) Typical material contents. Acetylene gas and gases under pressure of fifteen psig or more and in quantities greater than twenty-five hundred cubic feet, including hydrogen, illuminating gas, natural gas, and all other gases
    subject to explosion; gas piping at pressure levels above fifteen psig regardless of the quantities of gas; celluloid and celluloid products; cotton batting; kerosene; fuel or other oils having a flash point under 200°F (tag closed cup), except five
