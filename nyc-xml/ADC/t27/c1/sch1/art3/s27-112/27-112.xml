    or use has been made in a building, the re-establishment of a prior occupancy or use that would not be lawful in a new building of the same construction class shall be prohibited unless and until all the applicable provisions of this code and other
    applicable laws and regulations for such re-established occupancy or use shall have been complied with. A change from a use prohibited by the provisions of this code, but which was permitted prior to the effective date of this code, to another use
    prohibited by the provisions of this code shall be deemed a violation of this code.</text>
