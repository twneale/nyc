  <text>§ 27-867 Clearances from masonry and concrete chimneys. (a) All wood beams, joists, and studs shall be framed away from chimneys. Headers, beams, joists, and studs shall be at least two inches from the outside face of a chimney or from masonry enclosing
    a flue. Trimmers shall be not less than five inches from the inside face of the concrete or masonry chimney wall. Finished flooring shall have at least one-half inch clearance from chimney walls. (b) A clearance of at least four inches shall be provided
    between the exterior surfaces of masonry or concrete chimneys for commercial and industrial type incinerators and combustible material. (c) A clearance of at least two inches shall be provided between the exterior surfaces of interior masonry or concrete
    chimneys for all wood burning appliances. (d) No combustible lathing, furring, or plaster grounds shall be placed against a chimney at any point more than one and one-half inches from the corner of the chimney; but this shall not prevent plastering
    directly on masonry or on metal lath and metal furring nor shall it prevent placing chimneys for low temperature equipment entirely on the exterior of a building against the sheathing. (e) All spaces between chimneys and wood joists, beams, or headers
    shall be firestopped in accordance with the provisions of subchapter five of this chapter. (f) No change in the size or shape of a chimney shall be made within six inches of the roof framing through which it passes.</text>
