  <text>ยง 27-856 General requirements. (a) Equipment requiring chimneys. All gas-burning equipment that produces flue gas temperatures in excess of five hundred fifty degrees Fahrenheit or four hundred eighty degrees Fahrenheit above room temperature, and all
    solid and liquid fuel-burning equipment, shall be connected to chimneys that conform to the requirements of this subchapter. (b) Chimney construction. Unlisted chimneys shall be constructed of steel, brick, masonry units, concrete, concrete units,
    or equivalent materials. Chimneys shall be of adequate structural strength, with resistance suitable for the temperatures to which they may be subjected and resistive to the corrosive action of gases. For structural requirements, see subchapters ten
    and eleven of this chapter. (c) Separation of flues. Whenever more than one flue is installed within a chimney, the lining of each flue shall be separated, one from the other, as follows: (1) In low temperature chimneys with fire clay flue linings:
    by a wythe of cement grout at least one inch thick or other equivalent method. (2) In medium temperature and high temperature chimneys: by a division wall of brick or concrete at least three and three-quarters inches thick or other equivalent method.
    The separation between flue linings thus established shall in all cases be adequate to give stability for the chimney construction as required by subchapter ten of this chapter. (d) Test run. All new chimneys shall be test run by the applicant under
    operating conditions to demonstrate fire safety and the complete exhausting of smoke and the products of combustion to the outer air. The results of such test run shall be certified as correct by the applicant and shall be submitted in writing to
    the department. (e) Requirement of a smoke test. Whenever required by the commissioner after an inspection has been made of the chimney, a smoke test shall be made as outlined in section 27-868 of this article. Any faults or leaks found shall be corrected.
    Such smoke test shall be witnessed by a representative of the commissioner. In lieu thereof, the commissioner may accept the test report of an architect or engineer in which case the test shall be subject to the provisions for controller inspection
    except that the architect or engineer may be retained by the contractor.</text>
