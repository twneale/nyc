  <text>ยง 27-869.03 Reduction in flue size. Conversion from one fuel to another or the use of an existing chimney to service a fireplace or wood burning appliance may require a flue size change for proper operation. This may be done if the redesigned flue meets
    the criteria for the fuel and chimney type to be used as set forth in this subchapter. (a) Individual fireclay flue linings, in conformance with reference standard RS 15-14 or the equivalent not less than five-eighths inch thick, may be used but shall
    be carefully bedded one on the other in medium-duty fireclay refractory mortar in conformance with reference standard RS 15-6 or the equivalent as determined by the commissioner, with close fitting joints left smooth on the inside. Linings shall be
    separate from the chimney wall and the space between the liner and masonry shall not be filled; only enough mortar shall be used to make a good joint and hold the liners in position. (b) Cast in place chimney linings. (1) Cast in place linings shall
    be installed in accordance with reference standard RS 15-16 and with their listing and acceptance. (2) The applicant prior to the installation of the lining shall verify that the chimney meets the requirements of reference standard RS 15-4 and is
    in a sound and uncracked condition, that spalling has been removed and that there are no carbon or creosote deposits.</text>
