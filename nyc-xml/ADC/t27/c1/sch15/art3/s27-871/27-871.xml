  <text>§ 27-871 Chimney connection. In entering a flue in a masonry or metal chimney, the chimney connector shall be installed above the extreme bottom to avoid stoppage and in such manner or by such means as to prevent the chimney connector from entering
    so far as to restrict the space between its end and the opposite wall of the chimney. The chimney connector shall be firmly attached or inserted into a thimble or slip joint to prevent it from falling out of place. All connectors shall fit tightly.
    Chimney connections to any flue shall be limited to one floor. Two or more chimney connectors may be joined to a single connection provided that the chimney connectors are on one floor level and the flue is of sufficient size to serve all of the equipment
    thus connected. Chimney connectors shall be inspected at the time of the initial installation by the commissioner or by a duly authorized insurance company as provided in section two hundred four of the labor law.</text>
