  <text>ยง 27-893 Clearances. (a) Minimum clearance. Minimum clearances at vent connectors to combustible materials shall not be less than those listed in table 15-10. (b) Reduced clearances. These clearances may be reduced when the combustible construction
    is protected as provided in table 15-11. Table 15-10 Vent Connector Clearance for Gas-Fired Equipment ======================================================================== Minimum Distances from Combustible Materials (in.) ----------------------------------------
    Type B Gas Vent Other Than Type Equipment Material B Materials ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Boiler As required by Std. 6 Warm air furnace As required by Std. 6 Water heater As required by Std. 6 Room heater
    As required by Std. 6 Floor furnace As required by Std. 6 Conversion burner (with draft hood) 6 9 Equipment with draft hoods 6 9 Equipment without draft hoods Not Permitted 18 ========================================================================
    Table 15-11 Reduced Clearances for Vent Connectors with Specified Forms of Protection (a) ======================================================================== Reduced Clearances Where the Required Specified Form of Protection (b) Clearance with
    No Protection is: -------------------------------------- 18 in. 9 in. 6 in. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ (a) 1/4 in. asbestos millboard spaced out 1 in. (c) 12 6 3 (b) 28 gauge sheet metal on 1/4 in. asbestos
    millboard 12 4 2 (c) 28 gauge sheet metal spaced out 1 in. (c) 9 4 2 (d) 28 gauge sheet metal on 1/8 in. asbestos millboard spaced out 1 in. (c) 9 4 2 (e) 1 1/2 in. asbestos cement covering on heating appliance 18 9 6 (f) 1/4 in. asbestos millboard
    on 1 in. mineral fiber bats reinforced with wire mesh or equivalent 6 4 2 (g) 22 gauge sheet metal on 1 in. mineral fiber bats reinforced with wire or equivalent 3 2 2 (h) 1/4 in. asbestos cement board or 1/4 in. asbestos millboard 18 9 4 (i) 1/4
    in. cellular asbestos 18 9 3 ==================================================================== Notes: a. Except for the protection described in (e) above, all clearances should be measured from the outer surface of the appliance to the combustible
    material disregarding any intervening protection applied to the combustible material. b. Applied to the combustible material unless otherwise specified and covering all surfaces within the distance specified as the required clearance with no protection.
    Thicknesses are minimum. c. Spacers shall be on noncombustible material.</text>
