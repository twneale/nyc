  <text>ยง 27-886 Special venting arrangements. (a) Equipment with sealed combustion chambers. The vent requirements contained in this subchapter do not apply to equipment having sealed combustion chambers and which are so constructed and installed that all
    air for combustion is derived from outside the space being heated and all flue gases are discharged by integral vent to the outdoors. Such equipment, having integral venting, shall be installed in accordance with the conditions of the applicable standard
    governing their use. (b) Gas-vent exhausters and chimney exhausters. Gas-vent exhausters and chimney exhausters may be used with gas appliances in lieu of natural draft vents. Where an exhauster is used with gas-burning equipment requiring venting,
    provisions shall be made to prevent the flow of gas to the main burner in the event of failure of the exhaust system. A vent connector serving gas equipment vented by natural draft shall not be connected into the discharge side of a power exhauster.
    (c) Ventilating hoods and exhaust systems. Ventilating hoods and exhaust systems may be used to vent gas equipment installed in commercial applications. When automatically operated equipment, such as water heaters, are vented through natural-draft
    ventilating hoods, dampers shall not be installed in the ventilating system. When the ventilating hood or exhaust system is equipped with a power-driven exhaust fan, the equipment control system shall be so interlocked as to permit equipment operation
    only when the power exhaust is in operation. When used, ventilating hoods shall be built and installed in accordance with the provisions of subchapter thirteen of this chapter.</text>
