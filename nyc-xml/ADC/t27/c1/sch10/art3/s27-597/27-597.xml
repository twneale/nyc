  <text>ยง 27-597 Questionable construction. If, upon inspection, it is found that a construction or any part thereof, as built, shows open cracks, spallings, or other signs of distress; or should inspection records show more significant deficiency of construction;
    or should laboratory tests on concrete or other materials that have been incorporated into the work indicate deficiency of strength; or should there be a reasonable doubt as to the strength, stability, or adequacy of the construction or any part thereof,
    such construction may be checked to verify the adequacy thereof either by computation, or by core or load tests conducted in accordance with the provisions of section 27-598 or subdivision (b) of section 27-599 of this article or by any combination
    of these means. Should the adequacy of construction not be verified within a reasonable time, such construction shall be rejected and shall be demolished or reinforced or rebuilt to be made safe in conformance with the requirements of this code. In
    the event of a disagreement, the final decision as to the acceptance of the work shall be made by the commissioner. All such tests shall be made without expense to the city.</text>
