  <text>ยง 27-585 General requirements. For purposes of this code, the structural elements of a building shall normally include all floor, roof, and wall framing members and slabs (but not including slabs-on-grade); all piers, walls, footings, piles, and similar
    elements of the foundation; and all other elements of both foundation and superstructure which, in engineering practice, are proportioned on the basis of calculated stress. Where doubt exists as to the structural nature of an element, the provisions
    of this subchapter, and of subchapter eleven of this chapter, shall be deemed to apply only to an element in which the materials are stressed in excess of thirty-three and one-third per cent of the allowable stress values (without increase for infrequent
    stress conditions) for such material in its proposed use, or to an element wherein public safety would be involved in the event of excessive distortion under the applied loads.</text>
