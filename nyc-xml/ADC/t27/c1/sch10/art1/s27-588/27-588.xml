  <text>§ 27-588 Use of used and unidentified materials. The utilization of used materials and unidentified or ungraded materials shall be limited to non-structural elements, except: (a) Such materials (or elements) may be reused, or continued in use, at stress
    levels to which the materials or elements were subjected in the previous construction, or at load capacity as demonstrated by load test procedures as described in subdivision (a) of section 27-599 of article three of this subchapter. (b) Unidentified
    materials may be graded by the recovery and test of representative samples, or by other means satisfactory to the commissioner. (c) Used materials shall be considered to be graded where the grade is clearly indicated on the approved plans for the
    existing construction and may be used at the allowable stress levels for that grade of like material as established in the building code in force at the time the plans for the existing construction were approved. Table 10-1 Inspection of Materials
