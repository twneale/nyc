  <text>ยง 27-590 Deferred detailing. Where structural elements are normally detailed on shop or working drawings, the application for the permit shall so state, and issuance of the permit shall be conditioned upon future submission of such shop or working drawings
    showing the approval of an architect or engineer with regard to such elements, or of a signed statement by an architect or engineer to the effect that such drawings were prepared to his or her satisfaction. In cases where the detailing of structural
    elements has been made on the basis of fire-resistance ratings, load tables, or similar data as given in manufacturer's catalogues, the application for approval of the plans shall so state and issuance of such acceptance shall be conditional upon
    submission of a statement by the manufacturer, or of other supporting documentary evidence of accreditation furnished by the manufacturer, attesting to the accuracy of the data and stating that such data were derived in conformance with the provisions
    of this code. Where the detailing of structural elements has been made on the basis of data published in technical documents of recognized authority issued by, or accredited by, the agency or association promulgating the applicable reference standard
    cited in this code, such statements will not be required.</text>
