  <text>§ 27-613 Concrete utilizing preplaced aggregate. The use of concrete formed by the injection of grout into a mass of preplaced coarse aggregate will be permitted where it can be demonstrated by successful prototype installation that the proposed mix,
    materials, and method of placement will produce a concrete of the specified strength and free of areas or inclusions of uncemented aggregate. (a) Prototypes. At least two prototypes, from either previous work or samples prepared for the proposed project
    shall be prepared. The forms shall be stripped, and a minimum of six cores recovered and tested to demonstrate the strength of the concrete produced by the proposed materials and methods of installation. In addition, the homogeneity of the prototypes
    shall be demonstrated by demolishing the prototypes. (b) In-place concrete. The concrete, as finally placed in the work, shall be prepared using the same materials, mix, equipment, and procedures utilized to prepare the successful prototype installations.
    (c) Inspection. All preparation and placement of structural concrete utilizing preplaced aggregates shall be subject to controlled inspection. Compression test specimens shall be prepared and tested as required for premixed concrete, except that the
    specimens shall be prepared under conditions that will simulate the conditions under which the concrete in the work is installed.</text>
