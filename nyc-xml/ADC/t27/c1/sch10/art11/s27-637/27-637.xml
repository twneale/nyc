  <text>ยง 27-637 Tests of materials for bridge wire suspenders. The following minimum quantities of bridge wire for suspenders shall be tested: (1) Tensile strength tests of the wires shall be made of a specimen cut from each coil of zinc coated wire. (2) Tests
    for elongation and for yield strength shall be made on samples from approximately ten percent of the coils of any one size finished wire. If any of these tests fail to meet the specified requirements, all the coils in that lot of finished wire shall
    be tested and only coils that satisfactorily pass the test shall be used. (3) Tests of the zinc coating shall be made of approximately five percent of the coils of any one size of finished wire. If any of these tests fail to meet the specified requirements,
    all the coils in that lot of finished wire shall be tested and only coils that satisfactorily pass the test shall be used.</text>
