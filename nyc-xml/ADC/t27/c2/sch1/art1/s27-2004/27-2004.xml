  <text>ยง 27-2004 Definitions. a. The following terms, as used in this chapter, shall have the following meanings: 1. The term department shall mean the department, bureau, division or other agency charged with the enforcement of this title. 2. Wherever the
    word or words occupied, is occupied, used, or is used appear, such word or words shall be construed as if followed by the words "or is intended, arranged or designed to be used or occupied". 3. A dwelling is any building or structure or portion thereof
    which is occupied in whole or in part as the home, residence or sleeping place of one or more human beings. 4. A family is (a) A single person occupying a dwelling unit and maintaining a common household with not more than two boarders, roomers or
    lodgers; or (b) Two or more persons related by blood, adoption, legal guardianship, marriage or domestic partnership; occupying a dwelling unit and maintaining a common household with not more than two boarders, roomers or lodgers; or (c) Not more
    than three unrelated persons occupying a dwelling unit and maintaining a common household; or (d) Not more than three unrelated persons occupying a dwelling unit in a congregate housing or shared living arrangement and maintaining a common household;
    or (e) Members of a group home; or (f) Foster children placed in accordance with provisions of the New York state social services law, their foster parents, and other persons related to the foster parents by blood, marriage or domestic partnership;

    is defined in the New York city building code, and maintaining a common household pursuant to a lease, sublease, or occupancy agreement directly with such college or university, provided that: (i) The entire structure in which the dwelling unit is
    located is fully sprinklered in accordance with chapter 9 of the New York city building code; and (ii) Such occupancy does not exceed the maximums contained in subdivision a of section 27-2075; and (iii) Prior to commencement of such occupancy, and

    to exist if every member of the family has access to all parts of the dwelling unit. Lack of access to all parts of the dwelling unit establishes a rebuttable presumption that no common household exists. 5. "Person," for the purposes of article four
    of subchapter three of this chapter, means any adult or child over the age of four years. The term "person" as used in subchapters four and five of this code shall include the owner, mortgagee or vendee in possession, assignee of rents, receiver,

    of article one of subchapter five of this chapter and such declaration shall have been filed as therein provided, the term "person" shall be deemed to include, in addition to those mentioned hereinabove, all the officers, directors and persons having
    an interest in more than ten percent of the issued and outstanding stock of the owner as herein defined, as holder or beneficial owner thereof, if such person be a corporation other than a banking organization as defined in section two of the banking

    deemed to include a series of one-family or two-family dwelling units each of which faces or is accessible to a legal street or public thoroughfare, if each such dwelling unit is equipped as a separate dwelling unit with all essential services, and
    if each such unit is arranged so that it may be approved as a legal one-family or two-family dwelling. 7. A multiple dwelling is a dwelling which is either rented, leased, let or hired out, to be occupied, or is occupied, as the residence or home
    of three or more families living independently of each other. A multiple dwelling shall also include residential quarters for members or personnel of any hospital staff which are not located in any building used primarily for hospital use, but any
    building which was erected, altered or converted prior to July first, nineteen hundred fifty-five, to be occupied by such members or personnel or is so occupied on such date shall not be subject to the requirements of this code only so long as it
    continues to be so occupied if there are local laws applicable to such building and such building is in compliance with such local laws. A multiple dwelling does not include (i) a hospital, convent, monastery, asylum or public institution; or (ii)
    a fireproof building used wholly for commercial purposes except for not more than one janitor's apartment and not more than one penthouse occupied by not more than two families. For the purposes of this chapter, multiple dwellings are divided into

    family so occupying a dwelling unit shall be referred to herein as the permanent occupants of such dwelling unit. The following uses of a dwelling unit by the permanent occupants thereof shall not be deemed to be inconsistent with occupancy of such
    dwelling unit for permanent residence purposes: (1) (A) occupancy of such dwelling unit for fewer than thirty consecutive days by other natural persons living within the household of the permanent occupant such as house guests or lawful boarders,
    roomers or lodgers; or (B) incidental and occasional occupancy of such dwelling unit for fewer than thirty consecutive days by other natural persons when the permanent occupants are temporarily absent for personal reasons such as vacation or medical
    treatment, provided that there is no monetary compensation paid to the permanent occupants for such occupancy. (2) In a class A multiple dwelling owned by an accredited not-for-profit college or university or leased by such a college or university
    under a net lease for a term of forty-nine years or more, the use of designated dwelling units for occupancy for fewer than thirty consecutive days shall not be inconsistent with the occupancy of such multiple dwelling for permanent residence purposes
    if: (A) No more than five percent of the dwelling units in such multiple dwelling but not less than one dwelling unit, are designated for such use and the designation of a unit once made may not be changed to another unit; (B) A list of the designated
    dwelling units certified by an authorized representative of the college or university is kept on the premises by the owner or net lessee and made available upon request for inspection by the department or the fire department of such city; (C) Only
    designated dwelling units on the certified list are used for occupancy for fewer than thirty consecutive days and only by (i) natural persons, other than persons whose only relationship with the college or university is as a student, for whom the
    college or university has undertaken to provide housing accommodations such as visiting professors and academics, graduate students with research or teaching fellowships, researchers and persons presenting academic papers, interviewing for positions
    of employment or having other similar business with the college or university, or (ii) natural persons for whom a hospital affiliated with such college or university has undertaken to provide housing accommodations such as patients, patients' families
    and/or accompanying escorts, medical professionals and healthcare consultants or persons having other similar business with such hospital. A log shall be maintained on the premises of the names and addresses of such persons and the duration and reason
    for their stay. Such log shall be accessible upon request for inspection by the department and the fire department of such municipality; (D) No rent or other payment is collected for such occupancy; and (E) The fire department of such city shall require
    the filing of a fire safety plan or other appropriate fire safety procedure. (b) A garden-type maisonette dwelling project is a series of attached, detached or semi-detached dwelling units which are provided as a group collectively with all essential
