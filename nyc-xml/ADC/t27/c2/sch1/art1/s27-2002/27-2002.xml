  <text>§ 27-2002 Legislative declaration. It is hereby found that the enforcement of minimum standards of health and safety, fire protection, light and ventilation, cleanliness, repair and maintenance, and occupancy in dwellings is necessary to protect the
    people of the city against the consequences of urban blight. The sound enforcement of minimum housing standards is essential: 1. to preserve decent housing; 2. to prevent adequate or salvageable housing from deteriorating to the point where it can
    no longer be reclaimed; and 3. to bring about the basic decencies and minimal standards of healthful living in already deteriorated dwellings, which, although no longer salvageable, must serve as habitations until they can be replaced. In order to
    accomplish these purposes, and following a review of existing housing standards in the light of present needs, and a reexamination of methods of administration, including legal sanctions and remedies, to assure the effectiveness of enforcement, it
    is hereby found that the enactment of a comprehensive code of standards for decent housing maintenance, imposing duties and responsibilities for the preservation of the dwellings in the city upon owners and tenants, as well as on the municipality
    itself, enforceable by a broad range of legal, equitable and administrative powers, is appropriate for the protection of the health, safety and welfare of the people of the city.</text>
