  <text>ยง 27-2105 Identification of managing agent or owner and agent designated by the owner for the collection of rental payments if different from the managing agent to tenant. a. At the time of each rental payment, either a rent bill or receipt for such
    payment of rent shall be issued to the tenant of an apartment or rooming unit stating the name and New York City address of the managing agent (or of the designee described in paragraph five of subdivision a of section 27-2098 of this article), or,
    owner as recorded in the current registration statement on file in the department, and of the agent designated by the owner for the collection of rental payments if different from the managing agent. The rent bill or receipt for such payment of rent
    shall be printed on the letterhead of the managing agent or on the letterhead of the New York City address of the building owner. If there is a new managing agent, owner, or agent designated by the owner for the collection of rental payments, the
    rent bill or receipt shall state this. The registered name and address of the owner may be substituted for that of the managing agent if the owner resides or maintains an office where he or she customarily transacts business within the city. b. Written
