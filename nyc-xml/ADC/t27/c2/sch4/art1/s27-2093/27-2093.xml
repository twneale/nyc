  <text>ยง 27-2093 Certification of no harassment with respect to single room occupancy multiple dwellings. a. For the purposes of this section, "harassment" shall mean any conduct by or on behalf of an owner of a single room occupancy multiple dwelling that
    includes: (1) the use or threatened use of force which causes or is intended to cause any person lawfully entitled to occupancy of a dwelling unit in such multiple dwelling to vacate such unit or to surrender or waive any rights in relation to such
    occupancy; (2) the interruption or discontinuance of essential services which (i) interferes with or disturbs or is intended to interfere with or disturb the comfort, repose, peace or quiet of any person lawfully entitled to occupancy of a dwelling
    unit in the use or occupancy of such dwelling unit and (ii) causes or is intended to cause such person lawfully entitled to occupancy of such dwelling unit to vacate such unit or to surrender or waive any rights in relation to such occupancy; (3)
    the failure to comply with the provisions of subdivision c of section 27-2140 of article seven of subchapter five of this code which causes or is intended to cause such person lawfully entitled to occupancy of such dwelling unit to vacate such unit
    or to waive any rights in relation to such occupancy; or (4) any other conduct which prevents or is intended to prevent any person from the lawful occupancy of such dwelling unit or causes or is intended to cause such person lawfully entitled to occupancy
    of such dwelling unit to vacate such unit or to surrender or waive any rights in relation to such occupancy including but not limited to removing the possessions of any occupant from the dwelling unit; removing the door at the entrance to the dwelling
    unit; removing, plugging or otherwise rendering the lock on such entrance door inoperable; or changing the lock on such entrance door without supplying the occupant with a key. b. For the purposes of any hearing held pursuant to this section, any
    of the acts or omissions described in paragraphs, one, two, three and four of subdivision a of this section which are committed at a single room occupancy multiple dwelling shall be presumed to be committed by or on behalf of the owner of such multiple
    dwelling and it shall be presumed that such acts or omissions were committed with the intent to cause a person lawfully entitled to occupancy of a dwelling unit in such multiple dwelling to vacate such unit or to surrender or waive a right in relation
    to such occupancy. c. The commissioner shall certify whether there has been no harassment of the lawful occupants of a single room occupancy multiple dwelling, as such term is defined in section 27-198 of article nineteen of subchapter one of the
    building code, during the thirty-six month period prior to the date of the submission of an application for a certification of no harassment by an owner of such multiple dwelling. With respect to an application for a certification of no harassment
    which is submitted pursuant to paragraph three of subdivision b of section 27-198 of article nineteen of subchapter one of the building code, the date of submission of such application shall be deemed to be the date of submission of an application
    for plan approval. d. An application for certification of no harassment shall be in such form and shall contain such information and provisions as shall be prescribed by the commissioner including, but not limited to, consent by the applicant to access
    to the premises by governmental agencies, and shall be determined in accordance with the following procedure: (1) Upon the receipt of an application for a certification of no harassment, the commissioner shall publish notice in such publication as
    the commissioner deems appropriate for a period of seven consecutive days, shall mail notice to the owner of record, such occupants as the department shall identify, such other interested persons as the department shall identify, the local community
    board and appropriate government agencies and shall post notice in a conspicuous place on the premises of the multiple dwelling for which the certification is sought. (2) The notice shall be in such form as shall be prescribed by the commissioner
    and shall state, in English and whatever other language the commissioner deems appropriate: (a) the location and general description of the multiple dwelling for which the certification is sought; (b) a description of the certification procedure and
    its purpose; (c) the period of time for which certification is to be made; (d) in plain language, a description of conduct constituting harassment; and (e) that any occupants or former occupants of the multiple dwelling for which such certification
    is sought and other interested persons, government agencies and the local community board, are invited to submit their comments within thirty days of the date of such notice in writing or orally at a designated location. (3) Upon the expiration of
    such thirty day comment period, the commissioner may (i) determine that no harassment has occurred within the stated period of time and forthwith grant such certification, (ii) determine that a waiver of certification may be granted pursuant to subdivision
    e of this section and forthwith grant such waiver, or (iii) deny such certification without a prior hearing if there has been a finding by the office of rent control, the conciliation and appeals board or any court having jurisdiction that there has
    been harassment, unlawful eviction or arson by or on behalf of the owner at the multiple dwelling for which certification is sought during the stated period of time; or (iv) where there has been no prior determination of harassment, unlawful eviction
    or arson by or on behalf of the owner, provide that a hearing be held in the manner provided in section 27-2092 of this article if the commissioner has reasonable cause to believe that harassment has occurred within such stated period of time and
    that a waiver of certification may not be granted. At such hearing, the owner of the multiple dwelling for which such certification is sought, shall have the opportunity to be heard by the commissioner or a designee prior to the granting or denial
    of certification or of a waiver thereof. Notice of such hearing shall be given to the applicant and to other interested parties, governmental agencies and local community board in the manner to be prescribed by rules and regulations of the commissioner.
    Within forty-five days after such hearing, the commissioner shall either grant or deny such certification or waiver thereof. (4) If certification or a waiver thereof is denied, notice of such denial accompanied by written findings indicating the grounds
    for such denial shall be mailed to the owner of record and shall be filed in the office of the city register. Such determination shall be subject to review pursuant to article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules. (5) Neither such certification
    nor a waiver thereof shall be granted unless the applicant submits a sworn statement, in such form as the commissioner shall prescribe, by all the owners of the multiple dwelling representing that there will be no harassment of the occupants of such
    multiple dwelling by or on behalf of such owners. The corporation counsel may institute any action or proceeding in any court of competent jurisdiction that may be appropriate or necessary for the enforcement of this representation and agreement.
    Nothing contained herein shall preclude an occupant of such multiple dwelling from applying on his or her own behalf for similar relief. * (6) The commissioner shall promulgate rules and regulations to establish procedures relating to applications
    for and the issuance of supplemental certifications as required by paragraph nine of subdivision b of section 27-198 of the code. * NB Added L.L. 59/85 ยง 4, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 ยง 14 e. The commissioner may grant a waiver of certification
    of no harassment although the commissioner determines that harassment has occurred at the multiple dwelling for which such certification is sought during the thirty-six month period prior to the date of the submission of an application for a certification
    of no harassment if the commissioner finds that: (1) (a) the owner of record of the multiple dwelling with respect to which such certification is sought was the owner of record of such multiple dwelling prior to May fifth, nineteen hundred eighty-three
    or had entered into a contract of sale for the purchase of such multiple dwelling which was recorded prior to such date or, with respect to a certification proceeding where the alterations sought to be performed are of the type prescribed by regulation
    of the commissioner pursuant to subdivision b of section 27-198 of article nineteen of subchapter one of the building code, the owner of record of such multiple dwelling was the owner of record of such multiple dwelling prior to the date of the first
    publication of the regulations requiring certification for such type of alterations or had entered into a contract of sale for the purchase of such multiple dwelling which was recorded prior to such date; (b) such owner was not the owner of such multiple
    dwelling during any period of time in which such harassment occurred and did not at such multiple dwelling (i) otherwise engage or participate in such harassment; or (ii) with intent that harassment be performed, agree with one or more persons to
    engage in or cause the performance of harassment; or (iii) with intent that another person engage in conduct constituting harassment, solicit, request, command, importune or otherwise attempt to cause such person to engage in conduct constituting
    harassment; and (c) such owner acquired title pursuant to a bona fide transaction that is not intended to evade the provisions of this section; or (2) the owner acquired the multiple dwelling by sale pursuant to foreclosure of a mortgage or pursuant
    to a deed in lieu of foreclosure of a mortgage; provided, however, that such conveyance was a bona fide transaction for the purpose of enforcing the debt and not intended to evade the provisions of this section and either (i) a certification of no
    harassment or waiver thereof was granted with respect to such multiple dwelling within a sixty day period prior to the date of the recording of such mortgage and no suspension or rescission thereof was recorded prior to such date; or (ii) such mortgage
    was recorded prior to May fifth, nineteen hundred eighty-three, or, if such owner is a banking organization as defined in section two of the banking law, a national banking association, a federal savings and loan association, the mortgage facilities
    corporation, savings banks life insurance fund, the savings banks retirement system, an authorized insurer as defined in section four of the insurance law, or a trust company or other corporation organized under the laws of this state all the capital
    stock of which is owned by at least twenty savings banks or by at least twenty savings and loan associations or a subsidiary corporation all of the capital stock of which is owned by such trust company or other corporation, a commitment for such mortgage
    was made prior to May fifth, nineteen hundred eighty-three. (3) In determining whether such transaction was bona fide, the commissioner may consider whether at such multiple dwelling or any other such multiple dwelling such owner did (i) otherwise
    engage or participate in harassment; or (ii) with intent that harassment be performed, agree with one or more persons to engage in or cause the performance of harassment; or (iii) with intent that another person engage in conduct constituting harassment,
    solicit, request, command, importune or otherwise attempt to cause such person to engage in conduct constituting harassment. The commissioner may also consider the relationship between the parties to the transaction. (4) A waiver of a certification
    pursuant to this subdivision shall state the findings of the commissioner. f. (1) The commissioner may rescind a certification of no harassment or a waiver thereof granted with respect to the alteration or demolition of a multiple dwelling if the
    commissioner finds that harassment has occurred at the multiple dwelling with respect to which such certification or waiver thereof was issued after the period of time covered by such certification but prior to the commencement of substantial work
    pursuant to an alteration permit or demolition permit issued on the basis of such certification or waiver thereof. (2) If the commissioner has reasonable cause to believe that such harassment has occurred, the commissioner shall suspend the certification
    of no harassment or waiver thereof and upon the request of the commissioner, the commissioner of buildings shall not approve any plans or issue an alteration or demolition permit with respect to the alteration or demolition of such multiple dwelling
    or, if such plans have been approved and an alteration or demolition permit has been issued with respect to such alteration or demolition, issue a stop-work notice and order pursuant to section 27-227 of article twenty-four of subchapter one of the
    building code. Notice of such suspension shall be mailed to the owner of record of such multiple dwelling and shall be filed with the city register. (3) As soon as reasonably possible, but not later than thirty days after such suspension, the commissioner
    shall hold a hearing in the manner provided in section 27-2092 of this article upon appropriate notice and shall determine whether to rescind such certification; provided, however, that if, prior to the commencement of substantial work, the owner
    has been found by the office of rent control, the conciliation and appeals board or any court having jurisdiction, to have engaged in harassment, unlawful eviction or arson at the multiple dwelling, the commissioner may rescind such certification
    without holding a hearing. At such hearing the owner shall have an opportunity to be heard by the commissioner or a designee of the commissioner. (4) If the commissioner determines not to rescind such certification, the commissioner shall notify the
    commissioner of buildings of such determination and any stop-work notice and order issued by the commissioner of buildings pursuant to paragraph two of this subdivision shall be vacated immediately. Notice of such determination shall be mailed to
    the owner of record of such multiple dwelling and filed with the city register. (5) If the commissioner determines that such certification shall be rescinded, notice of such determination accompanied by written findings indicating the grounds for
    such determination shall be provided to the commissioner of buildings and shall be mailed to the owner of record of such multiple dwelling and filed with the city register. Such determination shall be subject to review pursuant to article seventy-eight
    of the civil practice law and rules. (g) For the purpose of any subsequent certification proceeding with respect to such multiple dwelling pursuant to this section, the granting of a certification of no harassment or a waiver thereof for any period
    of time shall be conclusive proof only for the purposes of this section that either no harassment occurred within the time period covered by such certification or that the waiver of such certification for such period of time was appropriate. h. The
    commissioner is authorized to establish and collect reasonable fees and charges from applicants for the administrative expenses incurred by the department for the certification proceedings prescribed in this section, including costs for publication
    and notices.</text>
