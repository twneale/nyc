  <text>ยง 27-2006 Duties of tenant. a. A tenant shall, in addition to complying with all provisions of this code and the multiple dwelling law applicable to him or her, be responsible for violations of this code to the extent that he or she has the power to
    prevent the occurrence of a violation. A tenant has the power to prevent the occurrence of a violation if: (1) It is caused by his or her own wilful act or that of a member of his or her family or household, or a guest; or (2) It is the result of
    such tenant's gross negligence, neglect or abuse, or the gross negligence, neglect or abuse of a member of his or her family, or household or a guest. b. The tenant, any member of his or her family or household, or his or her guest shall, with respect
    to the public parts of the premises, be liable if a violation is caused by such tenant's own wilful act, gross negligence, neglect or abuse. c. The fact that a tenant is or may be liable for a violation of this code or any other law or is found liable
    for civil or criminal penalties does not relieve the owner of his or her obligation to keep the premises, and every part thereof, in good repair.</text>
