  <text>ยง 27-2054 Residence of person performing janitorial services; limitation on number of dwelling units served. The person who performs janitorial services for a multiple dwelling of nine or more dwelling units (other than where janitorial services are
    performed on a twenty-four-hour-a-day basis under paragraph three of subdivision b of section 27-2053 of this article) shall reside in or within a distance of one block or two hundred feet from the dwelling, whichever is greater, unless the owner
    resides in the multiple dwelling. Where two or three multiple dwellings are connected or adjoining, it shall be sufficient, however, that the person who performs janitorial services resides in one of these, but no person who performs janitorial services
    for more than one multiple dwelling may service more than sixty-five dwelling units. Regardless of residence the janitor must have a telephone where the janitor may reasonably be expected to be reached.</text>
