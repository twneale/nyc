  <text>ยง 27-2021 Receptacles for waste matter. a. The owner or occupant in control of a dwelling shall provide and maintain metal cans, or other receptacles jointly approved as to specifications by the department, the department of sanitation and the department
    of health and mental hygiene, for the exclusive use of each building, which shall be of sufficient size and number to contain the wastes accumulated in such building during a period of seventy-two hours. No receptacle shall be filled to a height so
    as to prevent the effective closure thereof and no receptacle shall weigh more than one hundred pounds when filled. The receptacles shall be so constructed as to hold their contents without leakage. Metal cans shall be provided with tight-fitting
    covers and other receptacles shall be effectively closed. When requested by the department of sanitation, the owner or occupant in control shall separate and place in separate receptacles, ashes, organic and inorganic wastes. Nothing contained in
    this subdivision shall prevent the department, the department of sanitation and the department of health and mental hygiene from jointly approving as to specifications other systems for the disposal of waste utilizing containers of larger size and
    different construction as may be appropriate for such systems. b. Metal cans shall be kept within the dwelling or as required by the department until the time for removal of their contents when they shall be placed in front of the dwelling. When inside
    storage is required, receptacles of other materials shall be kept in a metal can or a rat-proof and fireproof room until the time of their removal when they shall be removed from the metal can and be neatly stacked in front of the dwelling. After
    the contents have been removed by the department of sanitation, any receptacles remaining shall be returned promptly to their place of storage. Metal cans shall be kept covered at all times and shall be disinfected regularly and maintained in a sanitary
    condition. Yard sweepings, hedge cuttings, grass, leaves, earth, stone, or bricks shall not be mixed with household wastes. c. Newspapers, wrapping paper, or other inorganic wastes which are likely to be blown or scattered about the streets shall
    be securely bundled, tied or packed before being placed for collection. Such material shall be kept and placed for collection in the same manner as the receptacles.</text>
