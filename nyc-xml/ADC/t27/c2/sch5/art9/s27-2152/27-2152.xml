    the owner pursuant to sections 27-2091 and 27-2095 of this code. The order shall require the owner to comply with subdivision a of section 27-2151 in the manner specified in such order within ten days. A copy of the order shall be filed with the city

    such additional proof as it deems necessary, including but not limited to the specific units offered for rent and the rents asked therefor. d. For the purposes of this section there shall be a rebuttable presumption that an owner has violated the

    competent jurisdiction. A judgment obtained in such an action shall constitute a lien against the premises with respect to which the violation occurred from the time of the filing of a notice of pendency in the office of the clerk of the county in
