  <text>ยง 27-2137 Recovery of expenses of receivership; lien of receiver. a. The expenditures made by the receiver pursuant to section 27-2135 of this article shall, to the extent that they are not recovered from the rents and income of the property collected
    by the receiver, constitute a debt of the owner and a lien upon the building and lot, and upon the rents and income thereof. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the provisions of article eight of this subchapter shall govern the effect and
    enforcement of such debt and lien; references therein to the department shall, for purposes of this article be deemed to refer to the receiver and, after such receiver's discharge, the department of housing preservation and development. b. Failure
    to serve a copy of the order and notice required in the manner specified by section 27-2131 of this article, or failure to serve any mortgagee or lienor with a copy of the order to show cause as required by subdivision c of section 27-2132 of this
    article, shall not affect the validity of the proceeding or the appointment of a receiver, but the rights of the department of housing preservation and development or of the receiver shall not in such event be superior to the rights of any mortgagee
    or lienor who has not been served as provided therein. c. Any mortgagee or lienor who at his or her expense remedies or removes the conditions to the satisfaction of the court pursuant to the provisions of subdivision c of section 27-2134 of this
    article shall have and be entitled to enforce a lien equivalent to the lien granted to the receiver in favor of the department of housing preservation and development hereunder. Any mortgagee or lienor who, following the appointment of a receiver
    by the court, shall reimburse the receiver and the department of housing preservation and development for all costs and charges as hereinabove provided shall be entitled to an assignment of the lien granted to the receiver in favor of the department
    of housing preservation and development.</text>
