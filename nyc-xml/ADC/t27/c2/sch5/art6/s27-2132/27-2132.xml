  <text>ยง 27-2132 Order to show cause. a. The department, upon failure of the owner to comply with an order 27-2131 of this article within the time provided therein, may thereafter apply to a court of competent jurisdiction in the county where the property
    is situated for an order directing the owner and any mortgagees or lienors of record to show cause why the commissioner of housing preservation and development should not be appointed receiver of the rents, issues and profits of the property and why
    the receiver should not remove or remedy such condition and obtain a lien in favor of the department of housing preservation and development against the property having the priority provided in article eight of this subchapter to secure repayment
    of the costs incurred by the receiver in removing such conditions. Such application shall contain (a) proof by affidavit that an order of the department has been issued, served on the owner, mortgagees and lienors, and filed, in accordance with section
    27-2131 of this article; (b) a statement that a serious fire hazard or a serious threat to life, health, or safety continued to exist in said dwelling after the time fixed in the department order for correction of the condition, and a description
    of the dwelling and conditions involved; (c) a brief description of the nature of the work required to remove or remedy the condition and an estimate as to the cost thereof. b. The order to show cause shall be returnable not less than five days after
    service is completed. c. A copy of the order to show cause, and the papers on which it is based, shall be served on the owner, mortgagees of record, and lienors. If any such persons cannot with due diligence be served personally within the city within
    the time fixed in the order, then service may be made by posting a copy of the order in a conspicuous place on the premises, and by sending a copy thereof by registered mail to the owner at the last address, if any, registered by such owner with the
    department, or to his or her last address, if any, known to the department, or, in the case of a mortgagee or lienor, to the address set forth in the recorded mortgage or lien, and by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the county
    where such premises are located. Service shall be deemed complete on filing proof thereof in the office of the clerk of the court in which application for such order is made.
