  <text>ยง 27-2134 Proceedings on return of order to show cause. a. On the return of the order to show cause, determination thereof shall have precedence over every other business of the court unless the court shall find that some other pending proceeding, having
    a similar statutory preference, has priority. b. If the court finds that the facts stated in the application warrant the granting thereof, then it shall appoint the commissioner of housing preservation and development receiver of the rents, issues
    and profits of the property. c. Notwithstanding subdivision b of this section, if, after determination of the issue, the owner, or any mortgagee or lienor or other person having an interest in the property, shall apply to the court to be permitted
    to remove or remedy the conditions set forth in the department's application and shall (1) demonstrate the ability promptly to undertake the work required; and (2) post security for the performance thereof within the time, and in the amount and manner,
    deemed necessary by the court, then the court may in lieu of appointing a receiver issue an order permitting such person to perform the work within a time fixed by the court. If at the time fixed in the order the work has not been satisfactorily done,
    the court shall appoint such receiver. If after the granting of an order permitting a person to perform the work but before the time fixed by the court for the completion thereof it shall appear to the department that the person permitted to do the
    same is not proceeding with due diligence, then the department may apply to the court, on notice to those persons who have appeared in the proceeding, for a hearing to determine whether a receiver shall be appointed immediately. On the failure of
    any person to complete the work in accordance with the provisions of an order under this subdivision, the department, or any receiver thereafter appointed shall be reimbursed for costs incurred by him or her in removing or remedying the condition
    and other charges herein provided for out of the security posted by such person.</text>
