  <text>ยง 27-2144 Lien on premises. a. There shall be filed in the office of the department a record of all work caused to be performed by or on behalf of the department. Such records shall be kept on a building-by-building basis and shall be accessible to
    the public during business hours. Such record may be made and maintained electronically. Within thirty days after the issuance of a purchase or work order to cause a repair to be made by or on behalf of the department, entry of such order shall be
    made on the records of the department. Such record may be made and maintained electronically. Such record shall be deemed to be entered on the date that such record is entered electronically on the records of the department. Such entry shall constitute
    notice to all parties. b. All expenses incurred by the department for the repair or the elimination of any dangerous or unlawful conditions therein, pursuant to this chapter or any other applicable provision of law, shall constitute a lien upon the
    premises when such charge is due and payable, which, notwithstanding any other provision of law, shall be the due and payable date for such charge provided on the second statement of account containing such charge. Such lien shall have a priority
    over all other liens and encumbrances on the premises except for the lien of taxes and assessments. However, no lien created pursuant to this chapter shall be enforced against a subsequent purchaser in good faith or mortgagee in good faith unless
    the requirements of subdivision a of this section are satisfied; this limitation shall only apply to transactions occurring after the date such record should have been entered pursuant to subdivision a and the date such entry was made. c. A notice
    thereof, stating the amount due and the nature of the charge, shall be sent by the department of finance in accordance with section 11-129 of the administrative code, and such charge shall be due and payable, notwithstanding any other provision of
    law, on the due and payable date provided on the second statement of account containing such charge. d. If such charge is not paid by the date when such charge is due and payable in accordance with subdivision c of this section, it shall be the duty
    of the department of finance to receive interest thereon at the rate of seven percent per annum, to be calculated to the date of payment from the due and payable date. e. Such charge and the interest thereon shall continue to be, until paid, a lien
    on the premises. Such lien shall be a tax lien within the meaning of sections 11-319 and 11-401 of the administrative code and may be sold, enforced or foreclosed in the manner provided in chapters three and four of title eleven of the administrative
    code or may be satisfied in accordance with the provisions of section thirteen hundred fifty-four of the real property actions and proceedings law. f. Any statement sent by the department of finance pursuant to this section shall have included thereon
    a reference to article eight of this subchapter.
