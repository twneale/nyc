  <text>ยง 27-2146 Validity of lien; grounds for challenge. a. In any proceedings to enforce or discharge the lien, the validity of the lien shall not be subject to challenge based on: (1) The lawfulness of the repair or other work done; or (2) The propriety
    and accuracy of the expense for which a lien is claimed, except as provided in this section. b. No challenge may be made except by (1) the owner of the property, or (2) a mortgagee or lienor whose mortgage or lien would, but for the provisions of
    section 27-2144 of this article, have priority over the department's lien. c. An issue specified in subdivision a which was decided, or could have been contested, in a prior court proceeding to secure a court order to repair under article five of
    this subchapter or to secure the appointment or the discharge of a receiver under article six of this subchapter, shall not be open to reexamination, but if any mortgagee or lienor entitled to notice of such prior proceeding was not served and did
    not appear therein, his or her mortgage or lien shall have priority over the lien of the department. In addition to this limitation, an owner who has been served with a statement pursuant to section 27-2129 of article five of this subchapter, or his
    successor in interest, may not subsequently contest the expense contained therein unless such owner or successor in interest notified the department in writing of his or her objection to the statement of account in the manner and within the time period
    provided in section 27-2129 of article five of this subchapter. d. With respect to any issue specified in subdivision a which is not subject to subdivision c, the statement of the department made pursuant to section 27-2145 of this article shall be
    presumptive evidence of the facts stated therein.</text>
