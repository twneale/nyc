  <text>§ 27-2118 Penalties; willful or reckless violations; false statements. (a) Any person who (1) Willfully or recklessly violates any provisions of this chapter; or (2) Willfully or recklessly violates, or fails to comply with, any requirement of an order
    of the department; or (3) Willfully makes, or causes any other person to make, any false or misleading statement on any registration statement, notice, or other document required to be filed pursuant to this chapter, or on any application, or any
    accompanying document, for the granting of any permit or any other action by the department pursuant to this chapter, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not less than ten dollars nor more than one thousand dollars for each such
    violation, or by imprisonment up to one year, or by both such fine and imprisonment. (b) A person commits a willful violation when such person intentionally acts, or intentionally fails to act, to cause a desired result that violates this chapter.
    A person commits a reckless violation when such person acts, or fails to act, with a conscious disregard of a substantial risk that the act or failure to act will result in a condition, constituting a violation of this code, which will endanger the
    life, health or safety of another person. (c) In a prosecution for a willful or reckless violation of a provision of this chapter, evidence of prior service of civil process or of prior judgments for civil penalties arising from the same violation,
    and relating to the same dwelling, shall be admissible on the issue of the defendant's knowledge of the existence of the violation. (d) Evidence that the defendant had knowledge or notice of the violation and failed to correct the same for more than
    six months or take reasonable action to explain to the department this failure or inability to make the correction shall be relevant on the issue of the willfullness of defendant's action. This subdivision shall not be construed to prevent conviction
    for a willful violation on other grounds.
