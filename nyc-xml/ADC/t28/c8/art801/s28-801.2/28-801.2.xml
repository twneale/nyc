    lower lip is low over the appliance(s) and is "set back" from the front of the appliance(s). It is always closed to the rear of the appliances by a panel where free-standing, or by a panel or wall where wall mounted, and its height above the cooking
    surface varies. (This style of hood can be constructed with partial end panels to increase its effectiveness in capturing the effluent generated by the cooking operation). Double Island Canopy Hood. A double island canopy hood is placed over back
    to back appliances or appliance lines. It is open on all sides and overhangs both fronts and the sides of the appliance(s). It could have a wall panel between the backs of the appliances. (The fact that exhaust air is drawn from both sides of the
    double canopy to meet in the center causes each side of this hood to emulate a wall canopy hood, and thus it functions must the same with or without an actual wall panel between the backs of the appliances). Eyebrow Hood. An eyebrow hood is mounted
    directly to the face of an appliance, such as an oven and dishwasher, above the opening(s) or door(s) from which effluent is emitted, extending past the sides and overhanging the front of the opening to capture the effluent. Pass-over Hood. A pass-over
    hood is a free-standing form of a backshelf hood constructed low enough to pass food over the top. Single Island Canopy Hood. A single island canopy hood is placed over a single appliance or appliance line. It is open on all sides and overhangs the
    front, rear, and sides of the appliance(s). A single island canopy is more susceptible to cross drafts and requires a greater exhaust air flow than an equivalent sized wall-mounted canopy to capture and contain effluent generated by the cooking operation(s).
    Wall Canopy Hood. A wall canopy exhaust hood is mounted against a wall above a single appliance or line of appliance(s), or it could be free-standing with a back panel from the rear of the appliances to the hood. It overhangs the front and sides of
    the appliance(s) on all open sides. The wall acts as a back panel, forcing the makeup air to be drawn across the front of the cooking equipment, thus increasing the effectiveness of the hood to capture ad contain effluent generated by the cooking
    operation(s). COMMISSIONER. The Commissioner of Buildings of the City of New York or his or her duly authorized representative. See Section 28-101.5 of the Administrative Code. COMPENSATING HOODS. Compensating hoods are those having integral (built-in)
    makeup air supply. The makeup air supply for such hoods is generally supplied from: short-circuit flow from inside the hood, air curtain flow from the bottom of the front face, and front face discharge from the outside front wall of the hood. The
    compensating makeup airflow can also be supplied from the rear or side of the hood, or the rear, front, or sides of the cooking equipment. The makeup air flow can be one or a combination of methods. COMPRESSOR. A specific machine, with or without
    accessories, for compressing a gas. COMPRESSOR, POSITIVE DISPLACEMENT. A compressor in which increase in pressure is attained by changing the internal volume of the compression chamber. COMPRESSOR UNIT. A compressor with its prime mover and accessories.

    test requirements. In addition to the ordinary inspection and test requirements which buildings, structures and parts thereof are required to undergo, smoke control systems subject to the provisions of Section 909 of the New York City Building Code
    shall undergo special inspections and tests sufficient to verify the proper commissioning of the smoke control design in its final installed condition. The design submission accompanying the construction documents shall clearly detail procedures and
    methods to be used and the items subject to such inspections and tests. Such commissioning shall be in accordance with generally accepted engineering practice and, where possible, based on published standards for the particular testing involved. The
    special inspections and tests required by this section shall be conducted under the same terms as found in Section 1704 of the New York City Building Code. 513.4 Analysis. A rational analysis supporting the types of smoke control systems to be employed,
    their methods of operation, the systems supporting them, and the methods of construction to be utilized shall accompany the submitted construction documents and shall include, but not be limited to, the items indicated in Sections 513.4.1 through
    513.4.6. 513.4.1 Stack effect. The system shall be designed such that the maximum probable normal or reverse stack effects will not adversely interfere with the system's capabilities. In determining the maximum probable stack effects, altitude, elevation,
    weather history and interior temperatures shall be used. 513.4.2 Temperature effect of fire. Buoyancy and expansion caused by the design fire in accordance with Section 513.9 shall be analyzed. The system shall be designed such that these effects

    barriers shall be constructed and sealed to limit leakage areas exclusive of protected openings. The maximum allowable leakage area shall be the aggregate area calculated using the following leakage area ratios: 1. Walls: A/A[w] = 0.00100 2. Exit
    enclosures: A/A[w] = 0.00035 3. All other shafts: A/A[w] = 0.00150 4. Floors and roofs: A/A[F} = 0.00050 where: A = Total leakage area, square feet (m{2}). A[F}] = Unit floor or roof area of barrier, square feet (m{2}). A[w] = Unit wall area of barrier,
    square feet (m{2}). The leakage area ratios shown do not include openings due to doors, operable windows or similar gaps. These shall be included in calculating the total leakage area. 513.5.1 Leakage area. Total leakage area of the barrier is the
    product of the smoke barrier gross area times the allowable leakage area ratio, plus the area of such as gaps and operable windows. Compliance shall be determined by achieving the minimum air pressure difference across the barrier with the system
    in the smoke control mode for mechanical smoke control systems. Passive smoke control systems tested using other approved means such as door fan testing shall be as approved by the commissioner. 513.5.2 Opening protection. Openings in smoke barriers

    Code. 513.6 Pressurization method. The primary mechanical means of controlling smoke shall be by pressure differences across smoke barriers. Maintenance of a tenable environment is not required in the smoke control zone of fire origin. 513.6.1 Minimum
    pressure difference. The minimum pressure difference across a smoke barrier shall be 0.05-inch water Gage (12.4 Pa) in fully sprinklered buildings. In buildings permitted to be other than fully sprinklered, the smoke control system shall be designed
    to achieve pressure differences at least two times the maximum calculated pressure difference produced by the design fire. 513.6.2 Maximum pressure difference. The maximum air pressure difference across a smoke barrier shall be determined by required
    door-opening or closing forces. The actual force required to open exit doors when the system is in the smoke control mode shall be in accordance with the New York City Building Code. Opening and closing forces for other doors shall be determined by
    standard engineering methods for the resolution of forces and reactions. The calculated force to set a side-hinged, swinging door in motion shall be determined by: F = F[dc]+K(WA/\P)/2(W-d) (Equation 5-2) where: A = Door area, square feet (m{2}).
    d = Distance from door handle to latch edge of door, feet (m). F = total door opening force, pounds (N). F[dc] = Force required to overcome closing device, pounds (N). K = Coefficient 5.2 (1.0). W = Door width, feet (m). /\P = Design pressure difference,

    smoke, ยฐF (K). T[o] = Temperature of ambient air, ยฐF (K). v = Air velocity, feet per minute (m/minute). 513.7.2 Prohibited conditions. This method shall not be employed where either the quantity of air or the velocity of the airflow will adversely
    affect other portions of the smoke control system, unduly intensify the dire, disrupt plume dynamics or interfere with exiting. In no case shall airflow toward the fire exceed 200 feet per minute (1.02 m/s). Where the formula in Section 513.7.1 requires
    airflow to exceed this limit, the airflow method shall not be used. 513.8 Exhaust method. When approved by the commissioner, mechanical smoke control for large enclosed volumes, such as in atria or malls, shall be permitted to utilize the exhaust

    or mechanical supply of outside air from outside or adjacent smoke zones to make up for the air exhausted. Makeup airflow rates, when measured at the potential fire location, shall not exceed 200 feet per minute (1.02 m/s) toward the fire. The temperature
    of the makeup air shall be such that it does not expose temperature-sensitive fire-protection systems beyond their limits. 513.8.2 Axisymmetric plumes. The plume mass flow rate (m[p]), in pounds per second (kg/s), shall be determined by placing the
    design fire center on the axis of the space being analyzed. The limiting flame height shall be determined by: z[l] = 0.533Q[c]{2/5} (Equation 5-4) For SI; z[l] = 0.166Q[c]{2/5} where: M[p] = Plume mass flow rate, pounds per second (kg/s). Q = Total
    heat output. Q[c] = Convective heat output, British thermal units per second (kW). (The value of Q[c] shall not be taken as less than 0.70Q). z = Height from top of fuel surface to bottom of smoke layer, feet (m). z[l] = Limiting flame height, feet
    (m). The z[l] value must be greater than the fuel equivalent diameter (see Section 513.9). for z &gt; z[l] m[p] = 0.022Q[c]{1/3}[z]{5/3}+0.0042Q[c] For SI: m[p] = 0.071Q[c]{1/3}z{5/3}+0.0018Q[c] for z = z[l] M[p} = 0.011 Q[c] For SI: m[p] = 0.035Q[c]

    per minute (m{3}/s). R = Density of air at the temperature of the smoke layer, pounds per cubic feet (T: in ยฐF)[kg/m{3}(T: in ยฐC)] 513.8.3 Balcony spill plumes. The plume mass flow rate (m[p]) for spill plumes shall be determined using the geometrically
    probable width based on architectural elements and projections in the following formula: M[p] = 0.124(QW{2}){1/3}(z[b]+0.25H) (Equation 5-6) For SI: m]p] = 0.36(QW[2}){1/3}(z[b]+0.25H) where: H = Height above fire to underside of balcony, feet (m).

    reduced entrainment resulting from the contact provided that the contact remains constant. Use of this provision requires calculation of the plume diameter, that shall be calculated by: d = 0.48 [(T[c]+460)/(T[a]+460)]{1/2}z (Equation 5-8) For SI:
    d = 0.48(T[c]/T[a]){1/2}z where: d = Plume diameter, feet (m). T[a] = Ambient air temperature, ยฐF (ยฐK). T[c] = Plume centerline temperature, ยฐF (ยฐK) = 0.6 (T[a]+460)Q[c]{2/3}Z{-5/3}+T[a] z = Height at which T[c] is determined, feet (m). For SI: T[c]
