  <text>ยง28-116.2.4.2 Final inspection prior to letter of completion. In all cases where the permitted work does not require the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the final inspection shall be performed by the department or at the option of the owner
    by an approved agency. Whenever the department performs a final inspection, the department shall charge a fee for such inspection. The applicant shall take all reasonable and necessary steps to insure that the final inspection is performed within
    one year after the expiration of the last permit. The inspection shall be performed after all work authorized by the building permit is completed. The person performing the inspection shall note all failures to comply with the provisions of this code
    or approved construction documents and shall promptly notify the owner in writing. All defects noted in such inspection shall be corrected. The final inspection report shall confirm that defects noted have been corrected, that the work is in substantial
    compliance with the approved construction documents and with this code and other applicable laws and rules and that all required inspections were performed. Final inspection reports shall be filed with and maintained by the department. Records of
    final inspections made by approved agencies shall be maintained by such persons for a period of six years after sign-off or for such other period as the commissioner shall require and shall be made available to the department upon request.
