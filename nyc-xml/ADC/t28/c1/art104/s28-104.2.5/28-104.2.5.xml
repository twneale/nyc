  <text>§28-104.2.5 Phased or partial approval. In the case of construction documents for the construction of new buildings or the alteration of buildings, the commissioner may grant partial approval of construction documents for the issuance of foundation
    and earthwork permits before the construction documents for the entire building or structure have been submitted. The approval of such partial applications will be subject to the submittal and approval of construction documents, filed together or
    separately, comprising: 1. The lot diagram showing the exact location of the lot and dimensions to the nearest corner; 2. A complete zoning analysis showing compliance of the proposed work with the zoning resolution; 3. The foundation plans, as provided
    for in this code; and 4. The floor and roof plans showing compliance with exit requirements, as provided for in this code. The issuance of such foundation and earthwork permit is subject to submission of required submittal documents. The owner and
    the holder of such foundation and earthwork permit shall proceed at their own risk with the construction operation and without assurance that a permit for the entire structure will be granted.</text>
