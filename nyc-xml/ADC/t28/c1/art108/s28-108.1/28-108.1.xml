    be issued unless the sidewalk in front of or abutting such building, including but not limited to the intersection quadrants for corner properties, shall have been paved or repaired by the owner, at his or her own cost, in the manner, of the materials,
    and in accordance with the standard specifications prescribed by the New York city department of transportation pursuant to sections 19-113 and 19-115 of the administrative code. Exceptions: 1. Application for the erection of an accessory building
    appurtenant to an existing one- or two-family dwelling. 2. Where the commissioner determines that a sidewalk is not required, provided that such determination shall not affect the obligations of the owner under subdivision a of section 19-152 of the
    administrative code, nor relieve the owner of any such obligations, nor impair or diminish the rights of the city or its agencies to enforce such obligations. 3. Where the extent of the change in use or occupancy or the cost of the alteration does
    not exceed a threshold established pursuant to rule of the commissioner.</text>
