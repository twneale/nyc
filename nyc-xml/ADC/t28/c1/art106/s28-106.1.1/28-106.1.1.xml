    (i) the building is free of asbestos containing material, or (ii) the commissioner of environmental protection, has issued a variance from this requirement in accordance with subdivision (o) of section 24-146.1 of the administrative code and the rules
    of the department of environmental protection, subject to the requirement that demolition work will be performed only in parts of the building that are certified free of asbestos containing material. The full demolition permit shall be subject to
