  <text>ยง 28-105.9 Expiration. All permits issued by the commissioner shall expire by limitation and become invalid if the permitted work or use is not commenced within 12 months from the date of issuance of the permit or, if commenced, is suspended or abandoned
    for a period of 12 months thereafter. All permits for work in an area of special flood hazard pursuant to Appendix G of the New York city building code shall expire if the actual start of permanent construction has not occurred within 180 days from
    the date on which such permit is issued. The commissioner may, however, upon good cause shown, reinstate a work permit at any time within a period of two years from the date of issuance of the original permit, provided that the work shall comply with
    all the requirements of this code and other applicable laws and rules in effect at the time application for reinstatement is made, and provided further that the applicant shall pay all reinstatement fees as required by article 112. The permit shall
    automatically expire upon the expiration of required insurance or if the applicant holds a license issued by the department upon the expiration or revocation of such license during the term of the permit.
