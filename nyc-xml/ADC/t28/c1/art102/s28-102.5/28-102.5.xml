  <text>ยง28-102.5 Grading of lots. The regulation of lots, in conformity with the street on which they are situated, shall be calculated at curb level. Where a lot has more than one street frontage, and is so situated that the street frontages intersect, the
    curb of the longest street frontage shall be used. When the street frontages do not intersect, the curb along each frontage shall be used to one-half the depth of the lot between street frontages. A lot as referred to in this section 28-102.5 shall
    mean a parcel of land twenty-five feet by one hundred feet, or less, in one ownership whether adjacent land be in the same or other ownership; but, for this purpose, no land in the same ownership may be divided into lots smaller than twenty-five feet
    by one hundred feet.</text>
