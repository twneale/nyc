  <text>ยง28-212.10 Rescission of order of closure. If at any time after the issuance of such order, the owner, mortgagee, or other person having an interest in the property provides assurance, in a form satisfactory to the commissioner, that the illegal commercial
    or manufacturing use of the premises has been discontinued and will not reoccur, or such owner, mortgagee, or other person establishes that the premises may be lawfully occupied for such use, the commissioner shall rescind the closure order. If such
    order is rescinded, the commissioner shall, upon request of such owner, mortgagee, or other person, provide a copy of such rescission, which may be filed with the county clerk or register of the county in which such premises are located. No such re-occupancy
    shall be permitted without a certificate of occupancy authorizing such use.</text>
