  <text>ยง28-204.6.2 Lien. All such unpaid judgments shall constitute a lien upon the property named in the violation with respect to which such judgment was rendered when the amount shall have been definitely computed as a statement of account by the department,
    and the department shall file such statement with the department of finance for entry against the property. Such lien shall have a priority over all other liens and encumbrances except for the lien of taxes and assessments. However, no lien created
    pursuant to this section 28-204.6 shall be enforced against a subsequent purchaser in good faith or mortgagee in good faith unless the requirements of section 28-204.6.1 are satisfied.</text>
