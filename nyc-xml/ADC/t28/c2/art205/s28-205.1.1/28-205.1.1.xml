  <text>§28-205.1.1 Corporation counsel. Such actions and proceedings may be instituted by the corporation counsel in the name of the city in any court of competent jurisdiction in the city and shall be given preference over pending causes therein. In such
    actions or proceedings, the city may apply for restraining orders, preliminary injunctions or other provisional remedies, with or without notice; and no undertakings shall be required as a condition to the granting or issuing of any such order, injunction
    or remedy, or by reason thereof. No court shall lose jurisdiction of any action or proceeding hereunder by reason of a plea that the title to real estate is involved if the object of the action is to recover a penalty for the violation of any of the
    provisions of this code.
