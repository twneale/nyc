  <text>ยง 28-1001.2 New York city amendments to the 2010 energy conservation construction code of New York state. The following New York city amendments to the 2010 energy conservation construction code of New York state are hereby adopted as set forth in this
    section: Chapter 1 Chapter 1 is deleted in its entirety and a new Chapter 1 is added to read as follows: CHAPTER 1 ADMINISTRATION SECTION ECC 101 SCOPE AND GENERAL REQUIREMENTS 101.1 General. These provisions shall be known and cited as the "New York
    City Energy Conservation Code," "NYCECC" or "ECC," and are referred to herein as "this code." All section numbers in this code shall be deemed to be preceded by the designation "ECC." Administration and enforcement of this code shall be in accordance
    with Title 28 of the Administrative Code. 101.2 Scope. This code applies to residential buildings and commercial buildings as defined in Chapter 2. 101.2.1 References. Where reference is made within this code to the Building Code of New York State,
    Existing Building Code of New York State, Fire Code of New York State, Fuel Gas Code of New York State, Mechanical Code of New York State, Plumbing Code of New York State, Property Maintenance Code of New York State or Residential Code of New York
    State, the reference shall be deemed to be to the analogous provision(s) of Title 28 of the Administrative Code (the New York City Construction Codes), the 1968 Building Code, the New York City Fire Code or the New York City Electrical Code. 101.2.2
    Occupancy classifications. For determination of occupancy classification and use within this code, a comparable occupancy classification shall be made to the New York City Building Code. 101.2.3 Reconciliation with Energy Conservation Construction
    Code of New York State. Whenever any provision of the Energy Conservation Construction Code of New York State provides for a more stringent requirement than imposed by this code, the more stringent requirement shall govern. 101.2.4 Other laws. The
    provisions of this code shall not be deemed to nullify any federal, state or local law, rule or regulation relating to any matter as to which this code does not provide. 101.3 Intent. This code shall regulate the design and construction of buildings
    for the effective use of energy. This code is intended to provide flexibility to permit the use of innovative approaches and techniques to achieve the effective use of energy. This code is not intended to abridge safety, health or environmental requirements
    contained in other applicable codes or ordinances. To the fullest extent feasible, use of modern technical methods, devices and improvements that tend to minimize consumption of energy and utilize to the greatest extent practical solar and other renewable
    energy sources without abridging reasonable requirements for the safety, health and security of the occupants or users of buildings shall be permitted. As far as may be practicable, the improvement of energy conservation construction practices, methods,
    equipment, materials and techniques shall be encouraged. 101.4 Applicability. The provisions of this code shall apply to the construction of buildings. Where, in any specific case, different sections of this code specify different materials, methods
    of construction or other requirements, the most restrictive shall govern. Where there is a conflict between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific requirement shall govern. 101.4.1 Existing buildings. Except as specified in
    this chapter, this code shall not be used to require the removal, alteration or abandonment of, nor prevent the continued use and maintenance of, an existing building or building system lawfully in existence at the time of adoption of this code. 101.4.2
    Historic buildings. An alteration or renovation to an existing building or structure that (1) is listed in the New York State Register of Historic Places, either individually or as a contributing building to a historic district, (2) is listed in the
    National Register of Historic Places, either individually or as a contributing building to a historic district, (3) has been determined to be eligible for listing in either the New York State or National Register of Historic Places, either individually
    or as a contributing building to a historic district, by the New York State Commissioner of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, or (4) has been determined to be eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places, either individually
    or as a contributing building to a historic district, by the United States Secretary of the Interior, need not comply with this code. 101.4.3 Additions, alterations, renovations or repairs. Additions, alterations, renovations or repairs to an existing
    building, building system, equipment or portion thereof, other than repairs of equipment, shall conform to the provisions of this code as they relate to new construction without requiring the unaltered portion(s) of the existing building, building
    system or equipment to comply with this code. Additions, alterations, renovations or repairs shall not create an unsafe or hazardous condition or overload existing building systems. An addition shall be deemed to comply with this code if the addition
    alone complies or if the existing building and addition comply with this code as a single building. Exception: The following need not comply with the provisions of this code provided that the energy use of the building is not increased: 1. Storm windows
    installed over existing fenestration. 2. Glass-only replacements in an existing sash and frame, provided that the U-factor and the solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) shall be equal to or lower than before the glass replacement. 3. Alterations, renovations
    or repairs to roof/ceiling, wall or floor cavities, including spaces between furring strips, provided that such cavities are insulated to the full existing cavity depth with insulation having a minimum nominal value of R-3.0/inch (R-2.0/cm). 4. Alterations,
    renovations or repairs to walls and floors in cases where the existing structure is without framing cavities and no new framing cavities are created. 5. Reroofing where neither the sheathing nor the insulation is exposed. Roofs without insulation
    in the cavity and where the sheathing or insulation is exposed during reroofing shall be insulated either above or below the sheathing. 6. Replacement of existing doors that separate conditioned space from the exterior shall not require the installation
    of a vestibule or revolving door, provided, however, that an existing vestibule that separates a conditioned space from the exterior shall not be removed. 7. An alteration that replaces less than 50 percent of the luminaries in a space, provided that
    such alteration does not increase the installed interior lighting power. 8. An alteration that replaces only the bulb and ballast within the existing luminaries in a space, provided that such alteration does not increase the installed interior lighting
    power. 101.4.4 Change in occupancy or use. Spaces undergoing a change in occupancy that would result in an increase in demand for either fossil fuel or electrical energy shall comply with this code. Where the use of a space changes from one use in
    Table 505.5.2 to another use in Table 505.5.2, the installed lighting wattage shall comply with Section 505.5. 101.4.5 Change in space conditioning. Any non-conditioned space that is altered to become conditioned space shall comply with this code.
    101.4.6 Mixed occupancy. Where a building includes both residential and commercial occupancies, each occupancy shall be separately considered and shall meet the applicable provisions of Chapter 4 for residential and Chapter 5 for commercial. 101.5
    Compliance. Residential buildings shall meet the provisions of Chapter 4. Commercial buildings shall meet the provisions of Chapter 5. 101.5.1 Compliance software. Compliance may be determined through the use of computer software developed by the
    United States Department of Energy, including REScheck, COMcheck or DOE2; of REM/Rate home energy rating and REM/Design home energy analysis software specifically developed for the 2010 Energy Conservation Construction Code of New York State; or of
    other building energy modeling or home energy rating software ("HERS") approved by the New York State Secretary of State. In the case of energy modeling, the commissioner may accept an energy cost budget worksheet based on ASHRAE 90.1 or Section 506
    and any information and/or reports showing acceptable results of the energy modeling. Software programs used to show compliance must indicate compliance with the 2010 Energy Conservation Construction Code of New York State to reflect the actual requirements
    of this code. REScheck or COMcheck printout forms must show "Energy Conservation Construction Code of New York State" in the title of the printout. Other software programs (for example, REM Rate/REM Design) shall clearly indicate compliance with 2010
    Energy Conservation Construction Code of New York State parameters. Compliance with the mandatory code provisions of Chapters 4 and 5 is required when using the software approach to show compliance. 101.5.2 Low-energy buildings. The following buildings,
    or portions thereof separated from the remainder of the building by building thermal envelope assemblies complying with this code, shall be exempt from the building thermal envelope provisions of this code: 1. Those with a peak design rate of energy
