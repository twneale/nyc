    electrical equipment, such as HVAC, lighting, power, fire, and security systems, including, at a minimum, control of the heating equipment using interior temperature sensors. CITY BUILDING. A covered building that is owned by the city and for which
    the city regularly pays all or part of the annual energy bills. Exception: The term "city building" shall not include: 1. Any building that participates in the tenant interim lease apartment purchase program. 2. Any building that participates in a

    recognized energy efficiency technologies to optimize energy performance of the building and achieve energy savings, provided that such process shall not be less stringent than the Level II Energy Survey and Engineering Analysis of the 2004 edition
    of Procedures for Commercial Building Energy Audits published by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-conditioning Engineers Inc. (ASHRAE). ENERGY AUDITOR. An approved agency authorized by the department to perform energy audits
    and to certify audit reports required by this article. Until such time as there is a national standard establishing qualifications for persons performing energy audits and such standard has been adopted by the department, an energy auditor shall be

    owner shall refer to the board of managers in the case of a condominium and the board of directors in the case of a cooperative apartment corporation. RETRO-COMMISSIONING. A systematic process for optimizing the energy efficiency of existing base
    building systems through the identification and correction of deficiencies in such systems, including but not limited to repairs of defects, cleaning, adjustments of valves, sensors, controls or programmed settings, and/or changes in operational practices.
    RETRO-COMMISSIONING AGENT. An individual, who shall not be a certified refrigerating system operating engineer or a licensed high pressure boiler operating engineer on the staff of the building being retro-commissioned, authorized by the department
