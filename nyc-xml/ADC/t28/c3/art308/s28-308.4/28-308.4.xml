  <text>ยง 28-308.4 Energy efficiency report required. Except as otherwise provided in section 28-308.7, the owner of a covered building shall file an energy efficiency report for such building between January first and December thirty-first of the calendar
    year in which such report is due pursuant to this section and between January first and December thirty-first of every tenth calendar year thereafter. Exceptions: 1. An owner may apply for an extension of time to file an energy efficiency report if
    despite such owner's good faith efforts, to be documented in such application, the owner is unable to complete the required energy audit and retro-commissioning prior to the scheduled due date for such report. The commissioner may grant no more than
    two such extensions of no more than one year each. Extensions granted pursuant to this provision shall not extend the scheduled due dates for subsequent energy efficiency reports. 2. An owner may receive annual extensions of time to file an energy
    efficiency report based on financial hardship of the building.</text>
