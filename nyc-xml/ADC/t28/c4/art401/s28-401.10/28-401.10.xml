    and shall have satisfactorily passed all required examinations and investigations, provided that no license or certificate of competence shall be issued unless and until the applicant shall have paid the required fee and complied with such other and
    further requirements for the particular license or certificate of competence as may be set forth in this chapter and in rules promulgated by the department. All licenses or certificates of competence issued by the commissioner shall have his or her
    signature affixed thereto; but the commissioner may authorize any subordinate to affix such signature. For licenses that require a plate and/or the application of a seal, the plate and/or seal shall be issued with the license except as provided otherwise
    in this chapter. The license, plate and seal are the property of the department and are not transferable by the licensee. No licensee shall make or cause to be made duplicates of a department-issued license, plate or seal. The loss or theft of a license,
    plate or seal must be reported to the department within five calendar days.</text>
