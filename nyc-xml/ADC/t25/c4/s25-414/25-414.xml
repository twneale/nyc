  <text>ยง 25-414 District management association. (a) There shall be a district management association for each district established pursuant to the provisions of this chapter (which shall pursuant to the not-for-profit corporation law have one or more classes
    of membership, voting or nonvoting) for the purpose of carrying out such activities as may be prescribed in the plan. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of paragraph (e) of section six hundred eleven of the not-for-profit corporation law,
    the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of such association shall provide for voting representation of owners of property and tenants within the district, and may provide that the votes of members who are property owners be weighted in proportion
    to the assessment levied or to be levied against the properties within the district, provided that in no case shall the total number of votes assigned to any one such member or to any number of such members under common ownership or control exceed
    thirty-three and one-third percent of the total number of votes which may be cast. (b) The board of directors of the association shall be composed of representatives of owners and tenants within the district, provided, however, that not less than
    a majority of its members shall represent owners and provided further that tenants of commercial space and dwelling units within the district shall also be represented on the board. The board shall include, in addition, four members, one member appointed
    by each of the following: the mayor, the comptroller, the borough president of the borough in which the district is located and the council member representing the council district in which the proposed district is located, or if the proposed district
    is located in more than one council district, by the speaker of the city council after consultation with the council members representing the council districts in which the proposed district is located. The additional four members shall serve as the
    incorporators of the association pursuant to the not-for-profit corporation law. The association may be incorporated prior to the effective date of any district established pursuant to this chapter. (c) In addition to such other powers as are conferred
    on it by law, the district management association may make recommendations to the city council with respect to any matter involving or relating to the district. (d) For such consideration as it may deem appropriate and consistent with the powers granted
    pursuant to section 25-404 of this chapter, the city council may license or grant to the district management association the right to undertake or permit commercial activities or other private uses of the streets or other parts of the district in
    which the city has any real property interest.</text>
