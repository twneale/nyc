  <text>ยง 25-102.1 City map; street and park names. a. Unless the local law specifically provides otherwise, any local law naming a street, park, playground or portion thereof, or any facility or structure, located and laid out on the city map, that does not
    bear a name indicated on the city map shall not be construed to require the addition of such name on the city map; provided, however, that the name given by such local law shall be posted on a sign placed at the location of such street, park, playground
    or portion thereof, or any facility or structure, located and laid out on the city map. b. Unless the local law specifically provides otherwise, any local law changing the name of a street, park, playground or portion thereof, or any facility or structure,
    located and laid out on the city map, that bears a name indicated on the city map shall not be construed to require a change in such name as it is indicated on the city map; provided, however, that in the case of a local law changing the name of a
    street or portion thereof, the name added by such local law shall be posted on a sign placed adjacent to or near a sign bearing the name of such street or portion thereof indicated on the city map. c. The department of transportation may establish
    different colors for signs bearing a street name not officially indicated on the city map and signs bearing a street name officially indicated on the city map, and may provide for the replacement of any sign bearing a dual name by two separate signs
    of such color as the department shall determine.</text>
