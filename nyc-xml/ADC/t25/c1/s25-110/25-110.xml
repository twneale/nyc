    and other open spaces and density of population shall be uniform for each class of buildings throughout each district. The regulation in one or more districts may differ from those in other districts. Such regulations shall be designed to secure safety

    erected in each district, the value of the land and the use to which it may be put, to the end that such regulations may promote public health, safety and welfare and the most desirable use for which the land of each district may be adapted and may
    tend to conserve the value of the buildings and may enhance the value of land throughout the city.</text>
