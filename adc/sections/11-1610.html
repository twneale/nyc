If a return required by this chapter is not filed, or if a return when filed is incorrect or insufficient, the amount of tax due shall be determined by the commissioner of finance from such information as may be obtainable
    and, if necessary, the tax may be estimated on the basis of external indices, such as volume of sales, inventories, purchases of containers, or of raw materials, production figures, and/or other factors. Notice of such determination shall be given
    to the person liable for the collection and/or payment of the tax. Such determination shall finally and irrevocably fix the tax unless the person against whom it is assessed, within thirty days after giving notice of such determination, shall apply
    to the commissioner of finance for a hearing, or unless the commissioner of finance of his or her own motion shall redetermine the same. After such hearing the commissioner of finance shall give notice of his or her determination to the person against
    whom the tax is assessed. The determination of the commissioner of finance shall be reviewable for error, illegality or unconstitutionality or any other reason whatsoever by a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules
    if application therefor is made to the supreme court within four months after the giving of the notice of such determination. A proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules shall not be instituted unless: (a) the amount
    of any tax sought to be reviewed, with penalties and interest thereon, if any, shall be first deposited with the commissioner of finance and there shall be filed with the commissioner of finance an undertaking, issued by a surety company authorized
    to transact business in this state and approved by the superintendent of insurance of this state as to solvency and responsibility, in such amount as a justice of the supreme court shall approve to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or
    the tax confirmed, the petitioner will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of the proceeding; or (b) at the option of the applicant such undertaking filed with the commissioner of finance may be in a sum sufficient to cover
    the taxes, penalties and interest thereon stated in such determination plus the costs and charges which may accrue against it in the prosecution of the proceeding, in which event the applicant shall not be required to deposit such taxes, penalties
    and interest as a condition precedent to the application.</span>
