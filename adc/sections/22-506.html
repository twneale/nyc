    employers shall make required health care expenditures on behalf of their employees and/or the families of their employees each fiscal year, beginning on July 1, 2006. Such expenditures may be made within thirty days after the close of the fiscal
    year for which such expenditures are required to be made; provided that no health care expenditures may be credited toward more than one fiscal year. * NB Validity of local law 1 of 2006 is currently a subject of disagreement between the mayor and
    the city council. (2) The administering agency shall annually determine the prevailing health care expenditure rate for employees in the covered industry using procedures and standards similar to those used to calculate prevailing wages and fringe
    benefits pursuant to sections 230 and 220 of the New York state labor law; provided that where thirty percent or more of such employees are covered by a valid collective bargaining agreement, the prevailing health care expenditure rate for such employees
    shall be equal to the health care expenditure rate for full-time employees as provided under such collective bargaining agreement; provided further that where there are more than one such collective bargaining agreements with differing health care
    expenditure rates for full-time employees which together cover thirty percent or more of the employees in the covered industry, the prevailing health care expenditure rate for such employees shall be the average such rate of all such agreements; and
    provided further that all employees employed in the covered industry shall be deemed to be in the same trade or occupation for purposes of determining the prevailing health care expenditure rate. Each prevailing health care expenditure rate determined
    pursuant to this subdivision shall be published by the administering agency by March 1 of each year and shall take effect on July 1 of the fiscal year. ** (3) Each covered employer shall annually determine its required health care expenditure by multiplying
    the prevailing health care expenditure rate as determined by the administering agency pursuant to this subdivision for such employer&#39;s covered industry by the total number of hours worked during the fiscal year by all the employees of such employer.
    A covered employer may use any reasonable methodology to determine (i) the number of hours worked during the fiscal year by its employees; (ii) such employer&#39;s required health care expenditure for the fiscal year; and (iii) whether the health care
    expenditure made by such employer during the fiscal year is at least equal to such employer&#39;s required health care expenditure for such year. Each covered employer shall file a concise statement describing such methodology with the administering agency,
    or if no such agency has been designated, with the city clerk, by April 1 of each year for the following fiscal year. ** NB Validity of local law 1 of 2006 is currently a subject of disagreement between the mayor and the city council. ** (4) A covered
    employer shall (i) maintain an accurate work log that includes, for each employee, such employee&#39;s name, trade or occupation, and the dates and hours or time periods worked by such employee, provided, however, that covered employers shall not be required
    to maintain such records in any particular form; (ii) provide an employee or such employee&#39;s designated representative(s) with access to such employee&#39;s work log and payroll records for inspection and copying; (iii) maintain accurate records of health
    care expenditures and required health care expenditures, and proof of such expenditures each year, provided, however, that covered employers shall not be required to maintain such records in any particular form; and (iv) provide a report to the administering
    agency on an annual basis containing the information required to be maintained pursuant to subparagraphs (i) and (iii) of this paragraph, and such other information as the administering agency shall require. Such report shall be made available to
    the public upon request without employee names or other personally identifying information. A covered employer that is a signatory to one or more collective bargaining agreements that cover at least seventy-five percent of its employees may comply
    with this section as provided in subdivision g. ** NB Validity of local law 1 of 2006 is currently a subject of disagreement between the mayor and the city council. d. Unlawful retaliation. It shall be unlawful for any covered employer to deprive
    or threaten to deprive any person of employment, take or threaten to take any retaliatory action against any person, or directly or indirectly intimidate, threaten, coerce, command or influence or attempt to intimidate, threaten, coerce, command or
    influence any person because such person has taken an action to enforce, inquire about or inform others about the requirements of this section. Taking any such adverse action against any person within ninety days of such person&#39;s exercise of rights
    pursuant to this section shall raise a rebuttable presumption that such action was in retaliation for the exercise of such rights. e. Violations and penalties. (1) Any covered employer found to be in violation of this section by failing to make health
    care expenditures during the fiscal year at least equal to the required health care expenditure for such employer shall be liable for a civil penalty equal to the amount of the shortfall. (2) Any covered employer found to be in violation of this section
    by failing to make health care expenditures during the fiscal year at least equal to the required health care expenditure for such employer shall correct such violation within ninety days of such determination. The administering agency shall serve
    a notice to correct such violation which shall specify the date which is ninety days from such determination by which the violation shall be corrected. Failure to correct such violation pursuant to this paragraph shall subject a covered employer to
    a civil penalty of not less than five hundred dollars for each day such violation continues. (3) Any covered employer found to have violated any of the requirements of paragraph (4) of subdivision c of this section shall be liable for a civil penalty
    of not less than five hundred dollars for each such violation. (4) In addition to being liable for civil penalties pursuant to this subdivision, any covered employer found to have violated this section may be subject to other action taken by the administering
    agency, including, but not limited to, requesting that city agencies or departments revoke or suspend any city-issued registration certificates, permits or licenses held by such covered employer until such time as the violation is remedied. (5) Penalties
    imposed pursuant to this section shall not affect any right or remedy available or civil or criminal penalty applicable under law to any individual or entity, or in any way diminish or reduce the remedy or damages recoverable in any action in equity
    or law before a court of law with competent jurisdiction. f. Enforcement. (1) The administering agency shall take appropriate action to enforce this section, including, but not limited to, periodically auditing covered employers to monitor compliance
    with this section; establishing a system to receive complaints from any person charging that a violation has occurred pursuant to this section; investigating complaints received; and making findings of violations and civil penalties in accordance
    with the provisions of this section. ** (2) Any proceeding to recover any civil penalty authorized pursuant to this section shall be commenced by the service of a notice of violation which shall be returnable to the administering agency. The commissioner
    or other designated person of such administering agency shall, after due notice and an opportunity for a hearing, be authorized to impose the civil penalties prescribed by this section. ** NB Validity of local law 1 of 2006 is currently a subject
    of disagreement between the mayor and the city council. (3) Any action or proceeding that may be appropriate or necessary for the correction of any violation issued pursuant to this section, including, but not limited to, actions to secure permanent
    injunctions, enjoining any acts or practices which constitute such violation, mandating compliance with the provisions of this section or such other relief as may be appropriate, may be initiated in any court of competent jurisdiction by the corporation
    counsel or such other persons designated by the corporation counsel on behalf of the administering agency. ** (4) Any joint-labor management committee established pursuant to the federal Labor Management Cooperation Act of 1978 (section 175a of title
    29 of the United States code) operating in the covered industry or any employee of a covered employer may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction against a covered employer that fails to make health care expenditures during the fiscal
    year at least equal to the required health care expenditure for such employer in violation of this section. Upon a determination of any such violation, the court may award any appropriate equitable relief to secure compliance with this section and
    shall award reasonable attorney&#39;s fees and costs incurred in maintaining the action to any complaining party who prevails in any such enforcement action. ** NB Validity of local law 1 of 2006 is currently a subject of disagreement between the mayor
    and the city council. (5) Any aggrieved person may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction against a covered employer for violation of subdivision d of this section. Upon a determination of any such violation, the court may award any
    appropriate remedy at law or equity and shall award reasonable attorney&#39;s fees and costs incurred in maintaining the action to any complaining party who prevails in any such enforcement action. (6) Any enforcement proceedings commenced under this
    section must be commenced within three years after the date of the occurrence or termination of the alleged violation, which ever occurs later. g. Exemption. A covered employer that is a signatory to one or more collective bargaining agreements that
    cover at least seventy-five percent of its employees may fully comply with the requirements of this section by filing annually with the administering agency proof of such collective bargaining agreements and their terms, in such form and manner as
    specified by the administering agency, and shall otherwise be exempt from all other provisions of this section. h. Rules. The administering agency shall promulgate rules in accordance with this section and such other rules as may be necessary for
    the purpose of implementing, construing and carrying out the provisions of this section. * NB Enacted without section heading.</span>
