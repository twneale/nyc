                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/nyc/adc/sections/27-2152.html'>§ 27-2152</a> Enforcement. a. If the commissioner has reasonable cause to believe that an owner has violated the provisions of subdivision a of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/27-2151.html'>section 27-2151</a>, the commissioner shall serve a notice of violation and an order to correct such violation on
    the owner pursuant to sections 27-2091 and 27-2095 of this code. The order shall require the owner to comply with subdivision a of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/27-2151.html'>section 27-2151</a> in the manner specified in such order within ten days. A copy of the order shall be filed with the city
    register and any subsequent purchaser of the property shall be subject to such order. b. An owner may apply within the ten day period following service of the notice and order: 1. for the revocation of the notice of violation and order on the ground
    that the condition alleged to constitute the violation did not exist at the time the violation was placed. The department may grant such revocation upon the presentation of proof satisfactory to the department; or 2. for an extension of the time for
    correction. The department may, upon good cause shown, including consideration of the complexity of repairs which may be necessary to make the dwelling unit habitable, grant such extension for such period of time that it deems appropriate. c. The
    owner shall certify correction of the violation in accordance with subdivision f of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/27-2115.html'>section 27-2115</a> no later than five days after the date set for corrections. Such certification shall be supported by a sworn statement by the owner that the units
    which are the subject of notice of violation have been rented to bona fide tenants or that the owner has, in good faith, made a continuing public offer to rent such units at rents no greater than the rents authorized by law. The department may require
    such additional proof as it deems necessary, including but not limited to the specific units offered for rent and the rents asked therefor. d. For the purposes of this section there shall be a rebuttable presumption that an owner has violated the
    provisions of subdivision a of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/27-2151.html'>section 27-2151</a> if a single room occupancy dwelling unit is not occupied by a bona fide tenant for a period of thirty days or longer. e. 1. An owner who violates the provisions of subdivision a of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/27-2151.html'>section 27-2151</a> shall
    be subject to a civil penalty of five hundred dollars for each single room occupancy dwelling unit cited in the notice and order issued pursuant to subdivision a of this section. In additon, an owner who fails to comply with the order within the time
    specified in the order or within such further period of time authorized by the department pursuant to subdivision b of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of two hundred fifty dollars per day for each dwelling unit to be calculated from
    a date ten days after service of the order to the date of compliance therewith. 2. In addition to the civil penalties provided in paragraph one of this subdivision any owner who willfully makes a false certification that a violation has been corrected
    shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than two hunred fifty dollars nor more than one thounsand dollars for each dwelling unit or units which are the subject of the notice of violation. Such owner shall also be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable
    by a fine of not less than two hundred fifty dollars nor more than one thousand dollars, or by imprisonment up to six months, or by both such fine and imprisonment. 3. Such civil penalties may be recovered by the city in an action in any court of
    competent jurisdiction. A judgment obtained in such an action shall constitute a lien against the premises with respect to which the violation occurred from the time of the filing of a notice of pendency in the office of the clerk of the county in
    which such premises is situated. A notice of pendency may be filed at the time of the commencement of the action or at any time before final judgment or order. f. All civil penalties recovered pursuant to subdivision e of this section shall be paid
    to the single room occupancy housing development fund company established pursuant to subdivision i of section 27-198.2 of the administrative code. g. 1. The city may institute an action in a court of competent jurisdiction for an order requiring
    the owner to comply with the order to correct or for such other relief as may be appropriate. 2. The city may make application for the appointment of a receiver in accordance with the procedures contained in article six of this subchapter. Any receiver
    appointed pursuant to this paragraph shall be authorized, in addition to any other powers conferred by law, to effect compliance with the provisions of this article. Any expenditures incurred by the receiver to effect such compliance shall constitute
    a debt of the owner and a lien upon the building and lot, and upon the rents and income thereof, in accordance with the procedures contained in such article six. The city in its discretion may provide funds to be expended by the receiver, and such
    funds shall constitute a debt recoverable from the owner in accordance with article eight of this subchapter. h. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of this article and other provisions of this code the provisions of this article
    shall control.</span>
