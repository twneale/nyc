If the amount of a taxpayer&#39;s federal taxable income, federal items of tax preference, total taxable amount or ordinary income portion of a lump sum distribution or includible gain of
    a trust reported on his federal income tax return for any taxable year, or the amount of any claim of right adjustment, is changed or corrected by the United States internal revenue service or other competent authority, or as the result of a renegotiation
    of a contract or subcontract with the United States or the amount an employer is required to deduct and withhold from wages for federal income tax withholding purposes is changed or corrected by such service or authority or if a taxpayer&#39;s claim for
    credit or refund of federal income tax is disallowed in whole or in part, the taxpayer or employer shall report such change or correction or disallowance within ninety days after the final determination of such change, correction, renegotiation, or
    disallowance, or as otherwise required by the commissioner, and shall concede the accuracy of such determination or state wherein it is erroneous. The allowance of a tentative carryback adjustment based upon a net operating loss carryback pursuant
    to section sixty-four hundred eleven of the internal revenue code shall be treated as a final determination for purposes of this section. Any taxpayer filing an amended federal income tax return and any employer filing an amended federal return of
    income tax withheld shall also file within ninety days thereafter an amended return under this chapter, and shall give such information as the commissioner may require. The commissioner may by regulation prescribe such exceptions to the requirements
    of this section as he or she deems appropriate. For purposes of this section, (i) the term &quot;taxpayer&quot; shall include a partnership having a resident partner or having any income derived from New York sources, and a corporation with respect to which
    the taxable year of such change, correction, disallowance or amendment is a year with respect to which the election provided for in subsection (a) of section six hundred sixty of the tax law is in effect, and (ii) the term &quot;federal income tax return&quot;
    shall include the returns of income required under sections six thousand thirty-one and six thousand thirty-seven of the internal revenue code. In the case of such a corporation, such report shall also include any change or correction of the taxes
    described in paragraphs two and three of subsection (f) of section thirteen hundred sixty-six of the internal revenue code. Reports made under this section by a partnership or corporation shall indicate the portion of the change in each item of income,
    gain, loss or deduction (and, in the case of a corporation, of each change in, or disallowance of a claim for credit or refund of, a tax referred to in the preceding sentence) allocable to each partner or shareholder and shall set forth such identifying
    information with respect to such partner or shareholder as may be prescribed by the commissioner.</span>
