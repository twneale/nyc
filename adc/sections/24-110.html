                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/adc/sections/24-110.html'>§ 24-110</a> Variances. (a) The commissioner may grant individual variances, except to governmental agencies, beyond the limitations prescribed by this code, whenever it is found, upon presentation of adequate proof, that compliance with any provision of
    this code, or with any regulation or order of the commissioner in respect to this code would impose unreasonable hardship. In granting a variance the commissioner may impose such conditions as the policies of this code may require and shall publish
    in the City Record no later than seven days after the granting of such variance a written opinion, stating the facts and reasons leading to his or her decision. (b) Any variance granted pursuant to this section shall be granted for such period of
    time, not to exceed six months, as shall be specified by the commissioner at the time of the grant of such variance and upon the condition that the person who receives such variance shall make such periodic progress reports as the commissioner shall
    specify. Such variance may be extended for periods not to exceed six months by affirmative action of the commissioner, but only if satisfactory progress has been shown. (c) Any person seeking a variance shall do so by filing a petition for variance
    in a form acceptable to the commissioner. The commissioner shall promptly give written notice of such petition to any person in the city who has in writing requested notice of variance petitions, and shall publish notice of such petition in the City
    Record. If the commissioner, in his or her discretion, concludes that a hearing would be advisable, or if any person files a written objection to the grant of such variance within twenty-one days from the publication of notice in the City Record,
    then a public hearing shall be held. (d) The commissioner may grant individual or group variances beyond the sulfur content restriction prescribed by <a href='/adc/sections/24-169.html'>section 24-169</a> of this code, whenever it is found, upon presentation of adequate proof, that the
    supply of fuel oil is insufficient to meet the demands of residents of the city of New York for heat, hot water, and electrical power. Where an applicant can show that it has an insufficient reserve of fuel oil meeting the sulfur content requirements
    of this code and that it is unable to buy a sufficient amount of such fuel oil to meet its fuel oil demands during the pendency of its variance application, the commissioner may grant a variance for up to forty-five days without complying with the
    procedural requirement of this section, except for the publication requirement of subdivision (a). During the time in which a temporary variance is running, the commissioner shall review, as soon as practicable, the application for a variance treating
    it as any other variance application. (e) With respect to a variance for the spraying of any substance containing asbestos in or upon a building or other structure during its construction, alteration or repair the commissioner shall in determining
    undue hardship take cognizance that such construction, alteration or repair was commenced or a permit has been granted for same by the department of buildings prior to August twentieth, nineteen hundred seventy-one or six months thereafter and that
    a non-asbestos spray material has not been approved for fireproof purposes by the department of buildings.</span>
