Public funds provided under the provisions of this chapter may be used only for expenditures by a principal committee to further the participating candidate&#39;s nomination for election or election, either in
    a special election to fill a vacancy, or during the calendar year in which the primary or general election in which the candidate is seeking nomination for election or election is held. 2. Such public funds may not be used for: (a) an expenditure
    in violation of any law; (b) payments made to the candidate or a spouse, domestic partner, child, grandchild, parent, grandparent, brother or sister of the candidate or spouse or domestic partner of such child, grandchild, parent, grandparent, brother

    (d) (i) any expenditure made after the candidate has been finally disqualified or had his or her petitions finally declared invalid by the New York city board of elections or a court of competent jurisdiction, except that such expenditures may be
    made: (A) as otherwise permitted pursuant to subdivision seven of <a href='//sections/3-709.html'>section 3-709</a> of this chapter, or (B) for a different covered election, other than a special election to fill a vacancy, held later in the same calendar year in which the candidate
    seeks election for the same office; provided, however, that public funds originally received for a special election to fill a vacancy may not be retained for expenditure in any other election; (ii) any expenditure made after the only remaining opponent
    of the candidate has been finally disqualified or had his or her petitions finally declared invalid by the New York city board of elections or a court of competent jurisdiction, except that such expenditures may be made for a different covered election,
    other than a special election to fill a vacancy, held later in the same calendar year in which the candidate seeks election for the same office; provided, however, that public funds originally received for a special election to fill a vacancy may
    not be retained for expenditure in any other election; (e) payments in cash; (f) any contribution, transfer, or loan made to another candidate or political committee; (g) gifts, except brochures, buttons, signs and other printed campaign material;
    (h) any expenditure to challenge or defend the validity of petitions of designation or nomination, or of certificates of nomination, acceptance, authorization, declination, or substitution, and expenses related to the canvassing of election results,
    made pursuant to subdivision four of <a href='//sections/3-706.html'>section 3-706</a>; (i) an expenditure made primarily for the purpose of expressly advocating a vote for or against a ballot proposal, other than expenditures made also to further the participating candidate&#39;s nomination
