                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/adc/sections/20-214.html'>§ 20-214</a> License requirements. a. Generally. (1) The application shall be made on a form to be provided by the commissioner and shall include such information as the commissioner shall deem pertinent. (2) Every amusement device owner, gaming cafe owner
    or amusement arcade owner must submit to the department either a valid certificate of occupancy or an equivalent document duly issued by the department of buildings stating that the premises in which such amusement device, gaming cafe or amusement
    arcade is to be located is situated in an area which is zoned to permit such use or a valid, current permit or special permit has been granted by the appropriate city agency permitting such use at the given location. If such permit or special permit
    shall expire or be terminated for any reason during the pendency of any license, the licensee shall present to the department a new permit or special permit authorizing such continued use of the premises for an amusement device, gaming cafe or amusement
    arcade. If such new permit or special permit is not presented within ten days of the expiration of the prior permit or special permit, such amusement device license, gaming cafe or amusement arcade license shall be terminated automatically and without
    any requirement of notice or hearing by the department. (3) Within fifteen days of receipt of a new application for a license to operate an amusement device, gaming cafe or an amusement arcade, the commissioner shall give notice of such new application
    to the affected community board and the council member for that district. The affected community board shall have fifteen days from receipt of the notification to comment on such application to the department. (4) The commissioner shall promptly notify
    the affected community board and the council member for that district of the final disposition of any license application that was subject to comment by the community board under paragraph three of this subdivision. b. Amusement Devices. (1) In order
    to apply for an amusement device license, the amusement device owner must present to the department a completed application at least thirty days before the amusement device is to be operated. (2) Every amusement device owner must submit with his or
    her license application for an amusement device proof that he or she has purchased insurance or posted cash or other security in an amount not less one million dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence or a bond in an amount not less than two million five
    hundred thousand dollars ($2,500,000) in the aggregate against liability for injury to persons arising out of the use of the amusement device. In addition, the application must be accompanied by the certificates of insurance for workers&#39; compensation
    and disability coverage. (3) Every amusement device owner must submit proof that an inspection of the amusement device was made by the department of buildings, and that such amusement device passed an elevator and/or electrical control inspection
    prior to the issuance or renewal of a license. (4) Every portable amusement device shall be equipped with a stairway on either or both sides thereof so that the stairway in use at any time for access to or egress from such portable amusement device
    shall at all times be within a reasonable distance from the sidewalk, such distance to be determined at the discretion of the commissioner. The operator of such portable amusement device shall not at any time permit any person to be admitted to the
    portable amusement device or to depart therefrom except by the stairway. c. Amusement Arcades and Gaming Cafes. (1) The commissioner, at the time an amusement arcade or gaming cafe license application is made, may prescribe conditions for the operation
    of such amusement arcade or gaming cafe in order to minimize adverse effects on the surrounding area, including, but not limited to, prescribing hours of operation and requirements for security and supervision. After a license is granted, the commissioner
    may prescribe such conditions from time to time upon notice and opportunity to be heard. (2) Each player-operated amusement device located within an amusement arcade or gaming cafe shall display a sign or signs, located and designed so as to be discernible
    by all players and prospective players, setting forth the rules of play, including the price of each game. (3) Where the amusement arcade or gaming cafe owner or the amusement operator in the amusement arcade or gaming cafe offers free games or prizes,
    signs shall be required to set out with clarity the number of wins or the score required to obtain a free game or prize; provided, however, that no amusement arcade or gaming cafe owner or amusement operator in the amusement arcade or gaming cafe
    shall offer money prizes or awards or such other prizes or awards which are redeemable or may be redeemed in money at the amusement arcade or gaming cafe or any other establishment, or which may be used as a credit or allowance or which may be exchanged
    for any money, credit or allowance. Any license to operate an amusement arcade or gaming cafe issued pursuant to subdivision c of <a href='/adc/sections/20-212.html'>section 20-212</a> of this subchapter shall be revoked, after notice and hearing, where (i) the department finds that the
    owner or operator of such arcade or cafe or an employee thereof has permitted on the premises of such arcade or cafe the offering or distribution of such prizes or awards; or (ii) the owner or operator of such arcade or cafe, or an employee thereof,
    is convicted of violating any section of article 225 of the penal law or of a lesser offense in satisfaction of a criminal charge pursuant to article 225 of the penal law, for conduct occurring on the premises of such arcade or cafe. (4) No amusement
    arcade or gaming cafe owner or operator shall permit persons under the age of eighteen, unless such persons are otherwise exempt under New York State Education Law, to enter or remain in an amusement arcade or gaming cafe between the hours of nine
    a.m. through three p.m. on weekdays during the regularly scheduled school year for public schools. Such owners shall prominently display a sign stating that, unless exempt by New York State Education Law, persons under eighteen years of age are not
    to enter or remain on the premises at such times and that the truancy laws of the state of New York will be enforced. d. Placement and Operation. No amusement device or player-operated amusement device or group of amusement devices and/or player-operated
    amusement devices shall be placed or operated in such a manner as to obstruct, or cause by the congregating of persons, an obstruction to, or interfere with, any public corridor or passageway, or to obstruct the entrance or exit to any premises. No
    amusement device or player-operated amusement device or group of amusement devices and/or player-operated amusement devices shall be placed on a public sidewalk in front of or adjacent to an amusement arcade or gaming cafe.</span>
