A trade waste broker shall not conduct an evaluation or analysis of the trade waste generated by a commercial establishment in order to recommend cost efficient means of waste disposal or other changes in
    related business practices, or broker a transaction between a commercial establishment which seeks trade waste removal, collection or disposal services and a trade waste business required to be licensed pursuant to this chapter, unless such broker
    has first presented a copy of his or her registration to such consumer. b. A trade waste broker who conducts an evaluation or analysis of a trade waste generated by a commercial establishment in order to recommend cost efficient means of waste disposal
    or other changes in related business practices shall not request or accept any payment in regard to such evaluation or analysis from a party other than the commercial establishment for whom such services are performed unless such broker has first
    disclosed to such establishment that he or she proposes to request or accept such payment. c. A trade waste broker who brokers a transaction between a commercial establishment seeking trade waste removal, collection or disposal services and a trade
    waste business required to be licensed pursuant to this chapter shall not request or accept payment from such trade waste business. d. A trade waste broker shall not engage in the collection of fees from commercial establishments for trade waste removal
    by a trade waste business required to be licensed pursuant to this chapter except where: (i) the contract for such fee collection complies with standards set forth in rules promulgated by the commission; (ii) such fee collection is upon the request
    of the customer; and (iii) such fee collection is part of an agreement providing for other services such as periodic waste evaluation and consulting with respect to source separation, recycling or other business practices relating to trade waste.
    e. A trade waste broker shall maintain such financial statements, records, ledgers, receipts, bills and other written records as the commission determines are necessary or useful for carrying out the purposes of this chapter. Such records shall be
    maintained for a period of time not to exceed five years to be determined by rule by the commission, provided however, that such rule may provide that the commission may, in specific instances at its discretion, require that records be retained for
    a period of time exceeding five years. Such records shall be made available for inspection and audit by the commission at its request at either the place of business of the trade waste broker or at the offices of the commission.</span>
