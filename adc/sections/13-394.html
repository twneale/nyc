                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/adc/sections/13-394.html'>§ 13-394</a> Board of trustees. a. The variable supplements fund shall be administered by a board of trustees which shall, subject to applicable provisions of law and to the prior approval of the board of estimate, from time to time establish rules and
    regulations for the administration and transaction of the business of such fund and for the control and disposition thereof. b. Such board shall consist of: 1. The representative of the mayor who is a member of the board of trustees of pension fund
    subchapter two, who shall be entitled to cast one vote. The mayor may, by instrument in writing filed in his or her office and with the board, designate one or more members of his or her office to act in the place of such representative at meetings
    of the board, in the event of such representative&#39;s absence therefrom. 2. The comptroller of the city, who shall be entitled to cast one vote. Any deputy comptroller authorized, pursuant to subdivision b of section ninety-four of the New York city
    charter, to act in the place of the comptroller as a member of the board of trustees of pension fund, subchapter two, may be authorized by the comptroller, in accordance with the provisions of such subdivision b, to act in the place of the comptroller
    as a member of the board. 2-a. The commissioner of finance, who shall be entitled to cast one vote. Such commissioner may, by instrument in writing filed in his or her office and with the board, designate one or more members of his or her office to
    act in his or her place at meetings of the board, in the event of such commissioner&#39;s absence therefrom. 3. Two members of the association designated by it, who shall each be entitled to cast one vote. The members so designated shall be officers of
    the association who are members of the board of trustees of pension fund subchapter two. Each such designee may at any time, by written authorization filed with the board, authorize any other officer of the association to act in his or her place as
    a member of the board in the event of such designee&#39;s absence from any meeting thereof; provided that the by-laws or constitution of the association provide for the designation of a representative for such purpose. c. Every act of the board shall
    be by resolution adopted only by a vote of at least three-fifths of the whole numbers of votes authorized to be cast by all of the members of such board. d. The actuary appointed pursuant to section 13-121 of the code shall be the technical adviser
    of the board. e. (1) As of June thirtieth of the nineteen hundred ninety-two--nineteen hundred ninety-three fiscal year and as of June thirtieth of each succeeding fiscal year, the actuary referred to in subdivision d of this section shall make a
    valuation of the assets and liabilities of the variable supplements fund in accordance with the requirements of the succeeding paragraphs of this subdivision e. (2) The actuary shall base such annual valuation of liabilities only (i) upon the persons
    who, as of each such June thirtieth, are pension fund beneficiaries and (ii) upon the persons who, being in service as of such June thirtieth as members of pension fund subchapter two, may be actuarially expected to retire thereafter as fire officers
    for service with twenty or more years of service creditable toward the minimum period. (3) The liabilities determined in such valuation shall be equal to the actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits. The actuarial assumptions used by the
    actuary in making such annual valuation of liabilities, including assumptions as to interest rate, mortality of pension fund beneficiaries and number of members of such pension fund in service as of June thirtieth who will retire as fire officers
    for service with twenty or more years of service creditable toward the minimum period, shall be adopted by the board on the recommendation of the actuary. (4) For the purposes of such annual valuation of the assets of the variable supplements fund,
    such assets shall be valued at their fair market value as of each such June thirtieth. f. The fire commissioner shall assign to the board such number of clerical and other assistants as may be necessary for the performance of its functions.</span>
