    whether in the form of profits, commission, or otherwise, realized by defendant as the result of the first subsequent arm&#39;s length sale, exchange, or transfer of the property, or, if defendant acted as a broker, the amount of any commissions received
    by defendant through the sale, exchange, or transfer of plaintiff&#39;s property, such gains in all cases to be calculated without regard to any expenses incurred by the defendant, and may in addition be awarded reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and court costs;
    or (ii) if the defendant has not realized any gains as defined in this subdivision, an amount equal to the difference between the price for which plaintiff sold his or her property and the fair market value at the time of the sale, or the fair market
    value of the property at the time the action is commenced, whichever difference is greater, and may in addition be awarded reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and court costs. 2. (a) Any buyer, through or from a real estate broker or real estate dealer, of
    real property the last owner of which, excluding such broker or dealer, was induced to sell, exchange or transfer his or her property by acts committed by such broker or dealer in violation of <a href='//sections/8-203.html'>section 8-203</a> or <a href='//sections/8-205.html'>section 8-205</a> of this chapter may institute
