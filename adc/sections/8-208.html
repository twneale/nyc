(a) Any owner of real property who is induced to sell his or her property through or to a real estate broker or real estate dealer by acts committed by such broker or dealer in violation of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/8-203.html'>section 8-203</a> or <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/8-205.html'>section 8-205</a> of
    this chapter may institute a civil action against such broker or dealer. (b) If, in an action instituted pursuant to this subdivision, judgment is rendered in favor of plaintiff, such plaintiff shall be awarded as damages (i) the amount of any gains,
    whether in the form of profits, commission, or otherwise, realized by defendant as the result of the first subsequent arm&#39;s length sale, exchange, or transfer of the property, or, if defendant acted as a broker, the amount of any commissions received
    by defendant through the sale, exchange, or transfer of plaintiff&#39;s property, such gains in all cases to be calculated without regard to any expenses incurred by the defendant, and may in addition be awarded reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and court costs;
    or (ii) if the defendant has not realized any gains as defined in this subdivision, an amount equal to the difference between the price for which plaintiff sold his or her property and the fair market value at the time of the sale, or the fair market
    value of the property at the time the action is commenced, whichever difference is greater, and may in addition be awarded reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and court costs. 2. (a) Any buyer, through or from a real estate broker or real estate dealer, of
    real property the last owner of which, excluding such broker or dealer, was induced to sell, exchange or transfer his or her property by acts committed by such broker or dealer in violation of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/8-203.html'>section 8-203</a> or <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/8-205.html'>section 8-205</a> of this chapter may institute

    the form of profits, commission, or otherwise, realized by defendant as the result of such plaintiff&#39;s purchase of the property, such gains in all cases to be calculated without regard to any expenses incurred by the defendant, and may in addition
    be awarded reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and court costs. 3. With respect to the sale, exchange or transfer of any property, the liability of a broker or dealer created by subdivision two of this section shall be independent of and additional to the
    liability of such broker or dealer created by subdivision one of this section.</span>
