The city planning commission, subject to the provisions of sections one hundred ninety-seven-c, two
    hundred and two hundred one of the charter, where applicable, shall have power to regulate and limit the height and bulk of buildings, to regulate and determine the area of yards, courts and other open spaces and to regulate density of population.
    The commission, subject to the same limitations, may divide the city into districts of such number, shape and area as it may deem best suited to carry out such purposes. b. The regulations as to height and bulk of buildings, the area of yards, courts
    and other open spaces and density of population shall be uniform for each class of buildings throughout each district. The regulation in one or more districts may differ from those in other districts. Such regulations shall be designed to secure safety
    from fire and other dangers and to promote the public health and welfare, including, so far as conditions may permit, provisions for adequate light, air and convenience of access. c. The commission shall pay reasonable regard to the character of buildings
    erected in each district, the value of the land and the use to which it may be put, to the end that such regulations may promote public health, safety and welfare and the most desirable use for which the land of each district may be adapted and may
    tend to conserve the value of the buildings and may enhance the value of land throughout the city.</span>
