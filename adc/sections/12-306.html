                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/nyc/adc/sections/12-306.html'>§ 12-306</a> Improper practices; good faith bargaining. a. Improper public employer practices. It shall be an improper practice for a public employer or its agents: (1) to interfere with, restrain or coerce public employees in the exercise of their rights
    granted in <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/12-305.html'>section 12-305</a> of this chapter; (2) to dominate or interfere with the formation or administration of any public employee organization; (3) to discriminate against any employee for the purpose of encouraging or discouraging membership in,
    or participation in the activities of, any public employee organization; (4) to refuse to bargain collectively in good faith on matters within the scope of collective bargaining with certified or designated representatives of its public employees;
    (5) to unilaterally make any change as to any mandatory subject of collective bargaining or as to any term and condition of employment established in the prior contract, during a period of negotiations with a public employee organization as defined
    in subdivision d of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/12-311.html'>section 12-311</a> of this chapter. b. Improper public employee organization practices. It shall be an improper practice for a public employee organization or its agents: (1) to interfere with, restrain or coerce public employees in
    the exercise of rights granted in <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/12-305.html'>section 12-305</a> of this chapter, or to cause, or attempt to cause, a public employer to do so; (2) to refuse to bargain collectively in good faith with a public employer or on matters within the scope of collective
    bargaining provided the public employee organization is a certified or designated representative of public employees of such employer; (3) to breach its duty of fair representation to public employees under this chapter. c. Good faith bargaining.
    The duty of a public employer and certified or designated employee organization to bargain collectively in good faith shall include the obligation: (1) to approach the negotiations with a sincere resolve to reach an agreement; (2) to be represented
    at the negotiations by duly authorized representatives prepared to discuss and negotiate on all matters within the scope of collective bargaining; (3) to meet at reasonable times and convenient places as frequently as may be necessary, and to avoid
    unnecessary delays; (4) to furnish to the other party, upon request, data normally maintained in the regular course of business, reasonably available and necessary for full and proper discussion, understanding and negotiation of subjects within the
    scope of collective bargaining; (5) if an agreement is reached, to execute upon request a written document embodying the agreed terms, and to take such steps as are necessary to implement the agreement. d. Joinder of parties in duty of fair representation
    cases. The public employer shall be made a party to any charge filed under paragraph three of subdivision b of this section which alleges that the duly certified employee organization breached its duty of fair representation in the processing of or
    failure to process a claim that the public employer has breached its agreement with such employee organization. e. A petition alleging that a public employer or its agents or a public employee organization or its agents has engaged in or is engaging
    in an improper practice in violation of this section may be filed with the board of collective bargaining within four months of the occurrence of the acts alleged to constitute the improper practice or of the date the petitioner knew or should have
    known of said occurrence. Such petition may be filed by one or more public employees or any public employee organization acting on their behalf, or by a public employer, together with a request to the board for a final determination of the matter
    and for an appropriate remedial order.</span>
