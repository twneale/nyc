                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-1317.html'>§ 11-1317</a> Penalties and interest. a. Any person failing to pay a tax payable under this chapter when due shall be subject to a penalty of fifty per centum of the amount of tax due, but the commissioner of finance, if satisfied that the delay was excusable,
    may remit all or any part of such penalty. Such penalty shall be paid and disposed of in the same manner as other revenues under this chapter. Unpaid penalties may be enforced in the same manner as the tax imposed by this chapter. b. (1) In addition
    to any other penalty imposed by this section, the commissioner of finance may (a) impose a penalty of not more than one hundred dollars for each two hundred cigarettes or fraction thereof in excess of one thousand cigarettes in unstamped or unlawfully
    stamped packages in the possession or under the control of any person and (b) impose a penalty of not more than two hundred dollars for each ten affixed or unaffixed false, altered or counterfeit cigarette tax stamps, imprints or impressions, or fraction
    thereof, in excess of one hundred affixed or unaffixed false, altered or counterfeit cigarette tax stamps, imprints or impressions in the possession or under the control of any person. Such penalty shall be determined as provided in <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-1310.html'>section 11-1310</a>
    of this chapter, and may be reviewed only pursuant to such section. Such penalty may be enforced in the same manner as the tax imposed by this chapter. The commissioner of finance, in his or her discretion, may remit all or part of such penalty. Such
    penalty shall be paid and disposed of in the same manner as other revenues under this chapter. (2) The penalties imposed by this paragraph may be imposed by the commissioner of finance in addition to any other penalty imposed by this section, but
    in lieu of the penalties imposed by subparagraph (a) of paragraph one of this subdivision: (a) not less than thirty dollars but not more than two hundred dollars for each two hundred cigarettes, or fraction thereof, in excess of one thousand cigarettes
    but less than or equal to five thousand cigarettes in unstamped or unlawfully stamped packages knowingly in the possession or knowingly under the control of any person; (b) not less than seventy-five dollars but not more than two hundred dollars for
    each two hundred cigarettes, or fraction thereof, in excess of five thousand cigarettes but less than or equal to twenty thousand cigarettes in unstamped or unlawfully stamped packages knowingly in the possession or knowingly under the control of
    any person; and (c) not less than one hundred dollars but not more than two hundred dollars for each two hundred cigarettes, or fraction thereof, in excess of twenty thousand cigarettes in unstamped or unlawfully stamped packages, knowingly in the
    possession or knowingly under the control of any person. Such penalty shall be determined as provided in <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-1310.html'>section 11-1310</a> of this chapter, and may be reviewed only pursuant to such section. Such penalty may be enforced in the same manner as the tax
    imposed by this chapter. The commissioner of finance, in his or her discretion, may remit all or part of such penalty. Such penalty shall be paid and disposed of in the same manner as other revenues under this chapter. * c. (1) The possession within
    the city of more than four hundred cigarettes in unstamped or unlawfully stamped packages shall be presumptive evidence that such cigarettes are subject to tax as provided by this chapter. (2) Nothing in this section shall apply to common or contract
    carriers or warehousemen while engaged in lawfully transporting or storing unstamped packages of cigarettes as merchandise, nor to any employee of such carrier or warehouseman acting within the scope of his or her employment, nor to public officers
    or employees in the performance of their official duties requiring possession or control of unstamped or unlawfully stamped packages of cigarettes, nor to temporary incidental possession by employees or agents of persons lawfully entitled to possession,
    nor to persons whose possession is for the purpose of aiding police officers in performing their duties. * NB Amended Ch. 765/85 § 38, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14 d. (1) If any amount of tax is not paid on or before the last date prescribed
    for payment (without regard to any extension of time granted for payment), interest on such amount at the rate set by the commissioner of finance pursuant to paragraph two of this subdivision, or, if no rate is set, at the rate of seven and one-half
    percent per annum, shall be paid for the period from such last date to the date of payment. In computing the amount of interest to be paid, such interest shall be compounded daily. Interest under this subdivision shall not be paid if the amount thereof
    is less than one dollar. The interest imposed by this subdivision shall be paid and disposed of in the same manner as other revenues from this chapter. Unpaid interest may be enforced in the same manner as the tax imposed by this chapter. (2) (A)
    The commissioner of finance shall set the rate of interest to be paid pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision, but if no such rate of interest is set, such rate shall be deemed to be set at seven and one-half percent per annum. Such rate shall
    be the rate prescribed in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph but shall not be less than seven and one-half percent per annum. Any such rate set by the commissioner of finance shall apply to taxes, or any portion thereof, which remain or become due
    on or after the date on which such rate becomes effective and shall apply only with respect to interest computed or computable for periods or portions of periods occurring in the period in which such rate is in effect. (B) General rule. The rate of
    interest set under this subdivision shall be the sum of (i) the federal short-term rate as provided under paragraph three of this subdivision, plus (ii) seven percentage points. (3) Federal short-term rate. For purposes of this subdivision: (A) The
    federal short-term rate for any month shall be the federal short-term rate determined by the United States secretary of the treasury during such month in accordance with subsection (d) of section twelve hundred seventy-four of the internal revenue
    code for use in connection with section six thousand six hundred twenty-one of the internal revenue code. Any such rate shall be rounded to the nearest full percent (or, if a multiple of one-half of one percent, such rate shall be increased to the
    next highest full percent). (B) Period during which rate applies. (i) In general. Except as provided in clause (ii) of this subparagraph, the federal short-term rate for the first month in each calendar quarter shall apply during the first calendar
    quarter beginning after such month. (ii) Special rule for the month of September, nineteen hundred eighty-nine. The federal short-term rate for the month of April, nineteen hundred eighty-nine shall apply with respect to setting the rate of interest
    for the month of September, nineteen hundred eighty-nine. (4) Publication of interest rate. The commissioner of finance shall cause to be published in the city record, and give other appropriate general notice of, the interest rate to be set under
    this subdivision no later than twenty days preceding the first day of the calendar quarter during which such interest rate applies. The setting and publication of such interest rate shall not be included within paragraph (a) of subdivision five of
    section one thousand forty-one of the city charter relating to the definition of a rule. * e. Cross-reference: For criminal penalties, see chapter forty of this title. * NB Added Ch. 765/85 § 39, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14</span>
