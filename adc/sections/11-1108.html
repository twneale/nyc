                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/adc/sections/11-1108.html'>§ 11-1108</a> Refunds. a. In the manner provided in this section the commissioner of finance shall refund or credit, without interest, any tax, penalty or interest erroneously, illegally or unconstitutionally collected or paid, if application for such refund
    shall be made to the commissioner of finance within three years from the time the return was filed or two years from the time the tax was paid, whichever of such periods expires later, or if no return was filed, within two years from the time the
    tax was paid. If the claim is filed within the three-year period, the amount of the credit or refund shall not exceed the portion of the tax paid within the three years immediately preceding the filing of the claim plus the period of any extension
    of time for filing the return. If the claim is not filed within the three-year period, but is filed within the two-year period, the amount of the credit or refund shall not exceed the portion of the tax paid during the two years immediately preceding
    the filing of the claim. Whenever a refund or credit is made or denied by the commissioner of finance, he or she shall state his or her reason therefor and give notice thereof to the taxpayer in writing. The commissioner of finance may, in lieu of
    any refund required to be made, allow credit therefor on payments due from the applicant. b. Any determination of the commissioner of finance denying a refund or credit pursuant to subdivision a of this section shall be final and irrevocable unless
    the applicant for such refund or credit, within ninety days from the mailing of notice of such determination, or, if the commissioner of finance has established a conciliation procedure pursuant to <a href='/adc/sections/11-124.html'>section 11-124</a> and the applicant has requested a
    conciliation conference in accordance therewith, within ninety days from the mailing of a conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner&#39;s confirmation of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding, both (1) serves a petition upon the
    commissioner of finance and (2) files a petition with the tax appeals tribunal for a hearing. Such petition for a refund or credit, made as herein provided, shall be deemed an application for a revision of any tax, penalty or interest complained of.
    Such hearing and any appeal to the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc from the decision rendered in such hearing shall be conducted in the manner and subject to the requirements prescribed by the tax appeals tribunal pursuant to sections one hundred
    sixty-eight through one hundred seventy-two of the charter. After such hearing, the tax appeals tribunal shall give notice of its decision to the applicant and to the commissioner of finance. The applicant shall be entitled to institute a proceeding
    under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules to review a decision of the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc if application to the supreme court be made therefor within four months after the giving of notice of such decision, and
    provided, in the case of an application by a taxpayer, a final determination of tax due was not previously made. c. If a taxpayer is required by subdivision d of <a href='/adc/sections/11-1104.html'>section 11-1104</a> of this chapter to file a report or amended return in respect of a change
    or correction of its sales and compensating use tax liability, claim for credit or refund of any resulting overpayment of tax shall be filed by the taxpayer within one year from the time such report or amended return was required to be filed with
    the commissioner of finance. This subdivision shall not affect the time within which or the amount for which a claim for credit or refund may be filed apart from this subdivision. d. A person shall not be entitled to a revision, refund or credit under
    this section of a tax, interest or penalty which had been determined to be due pursuant to the provisions of <a href='/adc/sections/11-1106.html'>section 11-1106</a> or 11-1107 of this chapter where he or she has had a hearing or an opportunity for a hearing, as provided in said sections,
    or has failed to avail himself or herself of the remedies therein provided. No refund or credit shall be made of a tax, interest or penalty paid after a determination by the commissioner of finance made pursuant to <a href='/adc/sections/11-1106.html'>section 11-1106</a> or 11-1107 of this
    chapter unless it be found that such determination was erroneous, illegal or unconstitutional or otherwise improper, by the tax appeals tribunal after a hearing or of the commissioner of finance&#39;s own motion or, if such tax appeals tribunal affirms
    in whole or in part the determination of the commissioner of finance, in a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules pursuant to the provisions of said section, in which event refund or credit without interest shall
    be made of the tax, interest or penalty found to have been overpaid.</span>
