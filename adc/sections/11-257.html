The city shall be divided into six classes of areas as provided in this part and pursuant to designation of areas to be made by the temporary commercial incentive area boundary commission.
    Within such areas, the following benefits shall be available to qualified recipients: a. (1) A recipient who, following the effective date of a certificate of eligibility, has performed industrial construction work in any area of the city shall be
    eligible for an exemption from real property taxes as follows: For the first thirteen tax years, the recipient shall be exempt from taxation on one hundred per centum of the exemption base. For the following nine tax years, the recipient shall be
    exempt from taxation on a percentage of the exemption base beginning at ninety per centum thereof in the fourteenth tax year and decreasing by ten per centum of said exemption base each year. The following table shall illustrate the computation of
    the exemption for industrial construction work: Tax year following effective date of certificate of eligibility: Amount of exemption: 1 through 13 ............. Tax on 100% of exemption base 14 ........................ Tax on 90% of exemption base
    15 ........................ Tax on 80% of exemption base 16 ........................ Tax on 70% of exemption base 17 ........................ Tax on 60% of exemption base 18 ........................ Tax on 50% of exemption base 19 ........................
    Tax on 40% of exemption base 20 ........................ Tax on 30% of exemption base 21 ........................ Tax on 20% of exemption base 22 ........................ Tax on 10% of exemption base (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subdivision,
    a recipient who filed an application for a certificate of eligibility for industrial construction work in any area of such city on or after July 1, 1995, and who, following the effective date of such certificate of eligibility, has performed such
    industrial construction work shall be eligible for an exemption from real property taxes as follows: for the first sixteen tax years, the recipient shall be exempt from taxation on one hundred per centum of the exemption base. For the following nine
    tax years, the recipient shall be exempt from taxation on a percentage of the exemption base beginning at ninety per centum thereof in the seventeenth tax year and decreasing by ten per centum of said exemption base each year. The following table
    shall illustrate the computation of the exemption for industrial construction work pursuant to this paragraph: Tax year following effective date of certificate of eligibility: Amount of exemption: 1 through 16.............. Tax on 100% of exemption
    base 17 ........................ Tax on 90% of exemption base 18 ........................ Tax on 80% of exemption base 19 ........................ Tax on 70% of exemption base 20 ........................ Tax on 60% of exemption base 21 ........................
    Tax on 50% of exemption base 22 ........................ Tax on 40% of exemption base 23 ........................ Tax on 30% of exemption base 24 ........................ Tax on 20% of exemption base 25 ........................ Tax on 10% of exemption
    base (3)(a) A recipient who filed an application for a certificate of eligibility for industrial construction work in any area of such city on or after July 1, 1995, and who, following the effective date of such certificate of eligibility, both commenced
    and completed such work, shall be eligible for an abatement of real property taxes as follows: for the first tax year immediately following completion of such work, and for the second, third and fourth tax years following completion of such work,
    the abatement shall equal fifty per centum of the real property tax that was imposed on the property which is the subject of the certificate of eligibility for the tax year immediately preceding the effective date of such certificate of eligibility,
    provided, however, that if such property was fully or partially exempt from real property taxes during such tax year, then the abatement shall equal fifty per centum of the real property tax that would have been imposed on such property but for such
    full or partial exemption. For the fifth and sixth tax years, the abatement shall equal forty per centum of such amount; for the seventh and eighth tax years, the abatement shall equal thirty per centum of such amount; for the ninth and tenth tax
    years, the abatement shall equal twenty per centum of such amount; and for the eleventh and twelfth tax years, the abatement shall equal ten per centum of such amount. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of this paragraph, a recipient shall
    not be eligible for an abatement for the first tax year following completion of such work, unless the recipient submits proof satisfactory to the department of finance that such work was completed on or before the taxable status date for such first
    tax year no later than thirty days after such taxable status date. Where the recipient fails to submit such proof in accordance with the foregoing sentence, a recipient shall not be eligible for an abatement until the second tax year following completion
    of such work. In such case, a recipient shall submit proof satisfactory to the department of finance that such work was completed on or before the taxable status date for such first tax year no later than thirty days after the taxable status date
    for such second tax year. A recipient whose abatement begins in the second tax year following completion of such work shall not thereby have his or her twelve-year benefit period shortened. The following table shall illustrate the computation of the
    abatement for industrial construction work pursuant to this paragraph: Tax year following completion of industrial construction work: Amount of abatement: 1 ...................................................50% 2 ...................................................50%
    3 ...................................................50% 4 ...................................................50% 5 ...................................................40% 6 ...................................................40% 7 ...................................................30%
    8 ...................................................30% 9 ...................................................20% 10 ..................................................20% 11 ..................................................10% 12 ..................................................10%
    (b) If, due to a determination of the department of finance or tax commission of such city or a court, the real property tax imposed on such property for the tax year immediately preceding the effective date of such certificate of eligibility is changed,
    then any abatement that was granted in accordance with this paragraph prior to such reduction shall be recalculated and any abatement to be granted in accordance with this paragraph shall be based on the real property tax imposed on such property
    for the tax year immediately preceding the effective date of such certificate of eligibility, as changed by such determination. The amount equal to the difference between the abatement orginally granted and the abatement as so recalculated shall be
    deducted from any refund otherwise payable or remission otherwise due as a result of a change due to such determination, and any balance of such amount remaining unpaid after making any such deduction shall be paid to the department of finance within
    thirty days from the date of mailing by the department of finance of a notice of the amount payable. Such amount payable shall constitute a tax lien on such property as of the date of such notice and, if not paid within such thirty-day period, penalty
    and interest at the rate applicable to delinquent taxes on such property shall be charged and collected on such amount from the date of such notice to the date of payment. (c) No property which is the subject of a certificate of eligibility pursuant
    to this part shall receive more than one abatement pursuant to this part and no abatement shall exceed one consecutive twelve-year period as specified in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph. (d) In no event shall an abatement granted pursuant to this
    part exceed in any tax year the real property taxes imposed on the property which is the subject of a certificate of eligibility pursuant to this part. (e) For the purpose of calculating an abatement of real property taxes pursuant to this part, where
    a tax lot contains more than one building or structure and not all of the buildings or structures comprising such tax lot are the subject of a certificate of eligibility for industrial construction work pursuant to this part, the real property taxes
    imposed on such tax lot for the year immediately preceding the effective date of such certificate of eligibility shall be apportioned among the buildings, structures and land comprising such tax lot and only such real property taxes as are allocable
    to the property which is the subject of the certificate of eligibility pursuant to this part shall be abated in accordance with this paragraph. Such apportionment shall be in accordance with rules promulgated by the department of finance. (f) A recipient
    who filed an application for a certificate of eligibility for industrial construction work in the commercial revitalization area on or after July first, two thousand, and who, following the effective date of such certificate of eligibility, both commenced
    and completed such work, shall be eligible for an abatement of real property taxes in accordance with subparagraph (a) of this paragraph, provided, however, that where the total net square footage of the industrial property used or immediately available
    and held out for use for manufacturing activities involving the assembly of goods or the fabrication or processing of raw materials is less than seventy-five per centum of the total net square footage of the industrial property, the abatement of real
    property taxes shall be determined in accordance with rules promulgated by the department of finance. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, no such abatement shall be allowed where the total net square footage of the industrial property used or
    immediately available and held out for use for such manufacturing activities after completion of industrial construction work is less than the total net square footage used or immediately available and held out for use for such manufacturing activities
    before the commencement of such construction work. For purposes of this subparagraph only, the term &quot;industrial construction work&quot; shall mean the modernization, rehabilitation, expansion or improvement of an existing building or structure for use
    as industrial property and the term &quot;industrial property&quot; shall mean nonresidential property on which will exist after completion of industrial construction work a building or structure wherein at least twenty-five per centum of the total net square
    footage is used or immediately available and held out for use for manufacturing activities involving the assembly of goods or the fabrication or processing of raw materials. b. (1) A recipient who, following the effective date of a certificate of
