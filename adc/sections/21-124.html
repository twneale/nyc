                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/adc/sections/21-124.html'>§ 21-124</a>. Prohibiting the use of Tier I shelters. a. The city shall not establish henceforth any Tier I shelters as defined in 18 NYCRR § 900.2 through § 900.18. After September 30, 1991, the city of New York shall not operate any Tier I shelters. b.
    1. No homeless family shelter shall be established which does not provide a bathroom, a refrigerator and cooking facilities and an adequate sleeping area within each unit within the shelter and which otherwise complies with state and local laws. All
    Tier II shelter units shall be such that they may be converted to be used for permanent housing with a minimum of structural change. 2. The following units are exempted or partially exempted from the provisions of paragraph one of this subdivision:
    (i) the Tier II units presently in operation shall be exempt; (ii) the 2,450 units of Tier II shelter housing currently in the construction pipeline shall be exempt; and (iii) units in facilities for battered women or substance and alcohol abusers
    which meet all state requirements for such programs may provide congregate dining and bathing arrangements. 3. The requirements of this subdivision shall not apply in cases where the provisions of § 21-121 (3) are invoked. c. Until June 30, 1992,
    notwithstanding any provision of this section, the mayor may authorize homeless families to be sheltered in any facility approved by the appropriate state authority for such purpose upon a finding by the commissioner that the city has more homeless
    families in need of shelter than the system can accommodate, for the following reasons: (1) the pattern of length of stay of families entering the system each month shows that the length of stay is increasing over time; (2) the city has experienced
    unexpected impediments to the construction or rehabilitation of permanent or transitional housing units, including, but not limited to work stoppages, natural disasters, unanticipated site conditions relating to such matters as soil conditions, contractor
    delays, availability of sewers, or the presence of asbestos which requires remedial action; (3) the city has not obtained necessary approval for sites selected for facilities to shelter homeless families; (4) construction or rehabilitation of permanent
    or transitional housing for homeless families has been and continues to be enjoined by court order; (5) an emergency such as a flood, earthquake or fire, or a medical emergency as certified by the commissioner of health, has rendered existing shelters
    unsuitable for use to house homeless families; (6) the number of homeless families requesting emergency housing exceeds the capacity of the system at any point in time; or (7) any other emergency circumstance. Such finding shall be made in writing
    and shall specify the time the commissioner anticipates will be needed for the city to meet the requirements of subdivisions a and b. Such finding shall be delivered promptly, and, when practicable, prior to the use of facilities pursuant to this
    subdivision, to the mayor, the speaker of the council, any council member in whose district families are to be sheltered pursuant to this subdivision, and to the families who receive shelter in facilities not meeting the requirements of subdivisions
    a and b. Within fifteen days of having made such finding, and at such other times as the council may request, the mayor shall report to the council on the plans to meet the requirements of subdivisions a and b and the progress that has been made in
    implementing such plans. The commissioner shall insure that the social service and medical needs of families sheltered pursuant to this subdivision shall be met in accordance with state regulations in 18 NYCRR § 900.2 through § 900.18 for Tier II
    shelters. Notwithstanding any provision of this paragraph, between September 30, 1991 and June 30, 1992, the shelters located at 282 East 3rd Street and 151 East 151st Street may be used for families except for homeless families with children. d.
    Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, on and after July 1, 1992, the commissioner of social services, after consultation with the speaker of the council, may certify that an emergency exists, pursuant to the criteria expressed in subdivision
    c, that requires the use of tier I shelters to meet legal mandates to provide shelter for homeless persons and, upon transmission of such certification for publication in the City Record together with a statement of the reasons therefor, which shall
    include a statement and documentation that there is no other alternative form of shelter available that complies with state and local regulations including invoking the powers under § 21-121 (3), may direct the use of such tier I shelters which are
    consistent with state and local laws as are necessary to meet the emergency; provided, however, that the commissioner of social services may not utilize a tier I shelter for more than forty-five days unless a local law shall be enacted permitting
    such use for the shelter.</span>
