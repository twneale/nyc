                    <span class="" style=""><a href='//sections/22-265.html'>§ 22-265</a> Registration of wholesale trade association; disqualification from office-holding. A wholesaler trade association shall, within the time period prescribed by the commissioner, register with the commissioner and shall disclose such information
    to the commissioner as the commissioner may by rule require, including but not limited to the names of all members of such association and of all persons holding office in such association. The commissioner may promulgate rules requiring that an association
    required to register pursuant to this section maintain financial statements, records, ledgers, receipts, bills and such other written records as the commissioner determines are necessary or useful for carrying out the purposes of this chapter. Such
    records shall be maintained for a period of time not to exceed five years to be determined by rule by the commissioner; provided, however, that such rule may provide that the commissioner may, in specific instances at his or her discretion, require
    that records be maintained for a period of time exceeding five years. Such records shall be made available for inspection and audit at the request of the commissioner at either the offices of the association or the offices of the department. b. An
    officer of a wholesale trade association required to register pursuant to this section shall inform the commissioner, on a form prescribed by the commissioner, of: (i) all criminal convictions, in any jurisdiction, of such officer; (ii) any pending
    civil or criminal actions to which such officer is a party; and (iii) any criminal or civil investigation by a federal, state, or local prosecutorial agency, investigative agency or regulatory agency, in the five year period preceding the date of
    registration pursuant to subdivision a of this section and at any time subsequent to such registration, wherein such officer has (A) been the subject of such investigation, or (B) received a subpoena requiring the production of documents or information
    in connection with such an investigation. Any material change in information reported pursuant to this subdivision shall be reported to the commissioner within thirty calendar days thereof. The commissioner may, if he or she has reasonable cause to
    believe that such an officer of a trade association lacks good character, honesty and integrity, require that such officer be fingerprinted by a person designated by the commissioner for such and pay a fee to be submitted to the division of criminal
    justice for the purpose of obtaining criminal history records. c. The commissioner may, after notice and opportunity to be heard, disqualify a person from holding office in a wholesale trade association when such person: (i) has failed, by the date
    prescribed by the commissioner, to be fingerprinted or to provide truthful information in connection with the reporting requirements of subdivision b of this section; (ii) is the subject of a pending indictment or criminal action against such officer
    for a crime which bears a relationship to the lawful and orderly operation of the market, in which case the commissioner may defer a determination pending a determination by the court before which such action is pending; (iii) has been convicted of
    a crime which, under the standards of article 23-A of the correction law, bears a relationship to the lawful and orderly operation of the market; (iv) has committed a racketeering activity or associated with a person who has been convicted of a racketeering
    activity, including but not limited to the offenses listed in subdivision one of section nineteen hundred sixty-one of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization statute (18 U.S.C. § 1961 et seq) or of an offense listed in subdivision one of
    section 460.10 of the penal law, as such statutes may be amended from time to time, when the officer knew or should have known of such conviction; or (v) has associated with any member or associate of an organized crime group as identified by a federal,
    state or city law enforcement or investigative agency when the officer knew or should have known of the organized crime associations of such person. An officer required to disclose information pursuant to subdivision a of this section may submit to
    the commissioner any material or explanation which such officer believes demonstrates that the officer does not lack good character, honesty and integrity. Upon receiving an order of the commissioner pursuant to this subdivision disqualifying a person
    from holding office in a wholesale trade association, such person shall vacate such office or, if such person fails to vacate such office within the time period specified by the commissioner, such association shall remove such person forthwith from
    such office. Failure of such person to vacate such office within the time specified by the commissioner shall subject such person to the penalties set forth in subdivision a of <a href='//sections/22-258.html'>section 22-258</a> of this chapter or to injunctive action by the city pursuant
    to subdivision c of such section. An office-holder who has been disqualified pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision may be excluded by the commissioner from the market. Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the commissioner
    to disqualify a wholesale trade association from representing or seeking to represent a business required to be registered pursuant to <a href='//sections/22-253.html'>section 22-253</a> of this chapter.
