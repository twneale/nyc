                    <span class="" style=""><a href='//sections/5-403.html'>§ 5-403</a> Definitions; special provision concerning acquisition of real estate used for public purposes. The term real estate as used in this subchapter shall be construed to signify and embrace all uplands, lands under water, the waters of any lake,
    pond or stream, all water rights or privileges, and any and all easements and incorporated hereditaments and every estate, interest and right, legal and equitable, in land or water, including terms for years, and liens thereon by way of judgment,
    mortgages or otherwise, and also all claims for damage to such real estate. It shall also be construed to include all real estate (as the term is above defined) heretofore or hereafter required or used for railroad, highway or other public purposes,
    providing the persons or corporations owning such real estate or claiming interest therein, shall be allowed the perpetual use for such purposes of the same or of such other real estate to be acquired for the purposes of this subchapter as will afford
    practicable route or location for such railroad, highway or other public purpose, and in the case of a railroad, commensurate with and adapted to its needs; and provided also that such persons or corporations shall not directly or indirectly be subject
    to expense, loss or damage by reason of changing such route or location, but that such expense, loss or damage shall be borne by the city. In case any real estate so acquired, or used for public purposes, is sought to be taken or affected for the
    purposes of this subchapter there shall be designated upon the maps referred to in the previous sections of this subchapter, and there shall be described in the petition, hereinbefore referred to, such portion of the other real estate shown on such
    maps and described in such petition, as it is proposed to substitute in place of the real estate then used for such railroad, highway or other public purposes. Provided, that wherever the commissioner of environmental protection has heretofore located
    on any map filed in the office of the commissioners of appraisal, a substituted route for any railroad, the same shall not be subsequently changed without the assent of such company. The supreme court at the special term to which the petition is presented
    or at such other special term as the consideration thereof may be adjourned to, shall either approve the substituted route or refer the same back to the commissioner of environmental protection for alteration or amendment and may refer the same back,
    with such directions or suggestions as such court may deem advisable, and as often as necessary and until such commissioners shall determine such substituted route as may be approved by the court. An appeal from any order made by such court at special
    term, under the provisions of this section, may be taken by any person or corporation interested in and aggrieved thereby to the appellate division and court of appeals, and shall be heard as a non-enumerated motion. The commissioners of appraisal,
    hereinbefore referred to, in determining the compensation to be made to the persons or corporations owning such real estate, or claiming interest therein, shall include in the amount of such compensation such sum as shall be sufficient to defray the
    expenses of making such change of route and location and of building such railroad or highway. Such commissioners of appraisal shall suggest in their report, and the court in the order confirming such report shall determine, subject to review by the
    appellate division, what reasonable time after payment of the awards to such persons or corporations shall be sufficient within which to complete the work of making such change. Neither the city, nor the commissioner of environmental protection shall
    be entitled to take possession or interfere with the use of such real estate for the enumerated purposes, before the expiration of such time. Such time may be subsequently extended by the court (subject to review as aforesaid) upon a sufficient cause
    shown. After the expiration of this time so determined or extended no use shall be made of such real estate which shall cause pollution to the water in such reservoir or interfere with its flow.</span>
