A person who peaceably surrenders an assault weapon to the commissioner pursuant to subdivision d, e or f of this section or subdivision f of <a href='/adc/sections/10-305.html'>section 10-305</a> shall not be subject to the criminal or civil penalties set forth in this

    be an offense punishable by a fine of not more than three hundred dollars or imprisonment of not more than fifteen days, or both, on condition that (1) such first violation is not in conjunction with the commission of a crime and (2) the possessor
    has not been previously convicted of a felony or a serious offense. c. Civil penalty. In addition to the penalties prescribed in subdivision b of this section, any person who shall violate subdivision a of this section shall be liable for a civil

    weapon, and any licensed dealer in firearms or licensed dealer in rifles and shotguns who is not licensed as a special theatrical dealer and who, on or after the effective date of this local law, shall possess an assault weapon, and any police officer
    or peace officer who, before the effective date of this local law was exempt from the sections of the administrative code requiring rifle and shotgun permits and certificates, and who, upon the effective date of this local law, is not exempt from
    the sections of the administrative code prohibiting the possession or disposition of assault weapons, and who, on or after the effective date of this local law, shall possess an assault weapon, shall, within ninety days of the effective date of rules
    promulgated by the commissioner pursuant to subparagraph 7 of paragraph a of subdivision 16 of <a href='/adc/sections/10-301.html'>section 10-301</a>, either: (1) peaceably surrender his or her assault weapon pursuant to subdivision f of <a href='/adc/sections/10-305.html'>section 10-305</a> for the purpose of destruction of
    such weapon by the commissioner, provided that the commissioner may authorize the use of such weapon by the department; or (2) lawfully remove such assault weapon from the city of New York. All assault weapons possessed by such permittees, licensees
    and previously exempt persons shall be subject to the provisions of this subdivision, whether defined as assault weapons in subdivision 16 of <a href='/adc/sections/10-301.html'>section 10-301</a> or in rules promulgated by the commissioner pursuant to subparagraph 7 of paragraph a of subdivision
    16 of <a href='/adc/sections/10-301.html'>section 10-301</a>. e. Disposition of assault weapons by non-permittees. Any person who, on or after the effective date of this local law, shall possess an assault weapon and who is not the holder of a valid permit for possession and purchase of
    rifles and shotguns and a certificate of registration for such assault weapon, shall peaceably surrender his or her assault weapon pursuant to subdivision f of <a href='/adc/sections/10-305.html'>section 10-305</a> for the purpose of destruction of such weapon by the commissioner, provided
    that the commissioner may authorize the use of such weapon by the department, and provided further that heirs and legatees may dispose of assault weapons pursuant to subdivision f of this section. f. Disposition of assault weapons by heirs and legatees.
    Any person who acquires an assault weapon on or after the effective date of this local law by the laws of intestacy or by testamentary bequest shall, within ninety days of such acquisition, either: (1) peaceably surrender such assault weapon pursuant
    to subdivision f of <a href='/adc/sections/10-305.html'>section 10-305</a> for the purpose of destruction of such weapon by the commissioner, provided that the commissioner may authorize the use of such weapon by the department; or (2) lawfully remove such assault weapon from the city of
    New York. g. Within thirty days of the effective date of rules promulgated by the commissioner pursuant to subparagraph 7 of paragraph a of subdivision 16 of <a href='/adc/sections/10-301.html'>section 10-301</a>, the commissioner shall send by regular mail to every person who has been
    issued a permit to possess a rifle or shotgun and whose rifle or shotgun the commissioner reasonably believes to be an assault weapon as defined in subdivision 16 of <a href='/adc/sections/10-301.html'>section 10-301</a> or as defined in such rules, a written notice setting forth the requirements
    and procedures relating to the disposition of such weapons, and the criminal and civil penalties that may be imposed upon the permittee for unlawful possession or disposition of such weapons. Failure by the commissioner to send, or the permittee to
    receive, such notice, shall not excuse such permittee for unlawful possession or disposition of such weapons. h. Surrender of firearms. At the discretion of the police commissioner, any person convicted of violating this section may be subject to
    immediate surrender of all firearms in his or her possession.</span>
