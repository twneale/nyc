                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/nyc/adc/sections/22-253.html'>§ 22-253</a> Registration required for wholesalers and market businesses. a. No person shall conduct a wholesale business or a market business in a public wholesale market unless such person has registered such business with the commissioner and has obtained
    a registration number for such business from the commissioner. Application for such registration shall be made upon a form prescribed by the commissioner containing such information as the commissioner shall determine appropriately identifies and
    demonstrates the fitness of the wholesale business or market business. A registration number shall not be transferable. A person conducting a wholesale business or a market business shall not sublease or assign to another person any portion of any
    premises in the market occupied or utilized by such business unless such proposed sublessee or assignee has registered with and obtained a registration number from the commissioner. The commissioner shall establish by rule a procedure for the preliminary
    review of registration applications for businesses not previously operating in a market that are considering the purchase of a wholesale business or a market business, and for the expedited completion of registration review upon entry into a purchase
    and sale agreement. A business required to register pursuant to this section shall inform the commissioner of any change in the ownership composition of the business, the arrest or criminal conviction of any principal of the business, or any other
    material change in the information submitted on the application for registration within thirty calendar days thereof. b. (i) Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, the commissioner may, when there is reasonable cause to believe that any or
    all of the principals of an applicant for registration lack(s) good character, honesty and integrity, require that such principal(s) be fingerprinted and provide to the commissioner the information set forth in subdivision a of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/22-259.html'>section 22-259</a> of this
    chapter, and may, after notice and the opportunity to be heard, refuse to register such applicant for the reasons set forth in subdivision b of such section. (ii) If at any time subsequent to the registration of a wholesale business or market business,
    the commissioner has reasonable cause to believe that any or all of the principals of such wholesale business or market business do not possess good character, honesty and integrity, the commissioner may require that such principal(s) be fingerprinted
    and provide the background information required by subdivision a of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/22-259.html'>section 22-259</a> of this chapter and may, after notice and the opportunity to be heard, revoke the registration of such wholesale business or market business for the reasons set forth
    in subdivision b of such section. (iii) At any time subsequent to the conduct of an investigation of an applicant for registration or a registrant pursuant to paragraph (i) or paragraph (ii) of this subdivision that has produced adverse information,
    the commissioner may require as a condition of issuance or the continuance of a registration that the wholesale business or market business enter into a contract with an independent auditor approved or selected by the commissioner. Such contract,
    the cost of which shall be paid by the registrant, shall provide that the auditor investigate the activities of the wholesale business or market business with respect to compliance with the provisions of this chapter, other applicable federal, state
    and local laws and such other matters as the commissioner shall determine. The contract shall provide further that the auditor report the findings of such monitoring and investigation in a manner to be prescribed by the commissioner to the commissioner
    on a periodic basis. (iv) A wholesale business or market business shall provide the commissioner with notice of at least ten business days of the proposed addition of a new principal to such business and shall provide the commissioner with such information
    concerning such proposed principal as is set forth in the rules promulgated by the commissioner pursuant to <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/22-266.html'>section 22-266</a> of this chapter. The commissioner may waive or shorten such period upon a showing that there exists a bona fide business requirement
    therefor. Except where the commissioner determines within such period, based on information available to him or her, that the addition of such new principal may have a result inimical to the purposes of this chapter, such wholesaler or market business
    may add such new principal pending the completion of review by the commissioner. Such wholesale business or market business shall be afforded an opportunity to demonstrate to the commissioner that the addition of such new principal pending completion
    of such review would not have a result inimical to the purposes of this chapter. If the commissioner determines, following completion of such review, that such principal lacks good character, honesty and integrity, the registration shall cease to
    be valid if the commissioner determines that such principal has failed to divest his or her interest, or to discontinue his or her involvement in the business of such business or both, as the case may be, within the time period prescribed by the commissioner.
    c. The department shall maintain and publish a list of all wholesalers and market businesses that are registered with the commissioner together with the registration numbers of such wholesalers and market businesses. The department shall make such
    list available to suppliers, shippers, truckers and any member of the public who requests it and shall, upon request, verify to suppliers, shippers and truckers whether a business is currently registered with the commissioner.</span>
