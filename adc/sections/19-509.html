                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/adc/sections/19-509.html'>§ 19-509</a> Licensing of taximeter business. a. It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in the business of manufacturing, selling, repairing and adjusting or calibrating taximeters or taximeter equipment for use upon any licensed vehicle in the city
    unless he or she shall secure a license therefor from the commission, and such person engaged in the business of installing, repairing, adjusting or calibrating taximeters shall only be licensed if he shall have a place of business within the city
    large enough simultaneously to accommodate at least three vehicles. Such licenses shall be issued for a period not exceeding one year and shall expire on the thirty-first day of March following the date of issue. The fee for the issuance of each such
    license shall be five hundred dollars per annum for each place of business licensed provided, however, that upon the issuance of a license for a period of six months or less, the fee shall be one-half the annual fee fixed by the commission. b. It
    shall be unlawful for such person to sell or attach to a licensed vehicle for use within the city a taximeter which does not comply with the rules and regulations established by the commission, and the commission may establish such rules and regulations
    in respect to the taximeter business as may be reasonable to assure adequate protection of the public and enforcement of the provisions and purposes of this chapter and may require such reports and other information as it deems necessary or advisable.
    Any person who shall install, repair, adjust or calibrate any taximeter shall securely affix to the inside of the glass window thereon, so as to be clearly legible from the outside, a printed poster bearing his or her license number. c. Fees to be
    charged by persons licensed pursuant to this section shall be subject to approval of the commission. In determining whether any proposed fee or fee schedules shall be approved, the commission shall take into consideration the nature of the service
    performed, the costs of the licensee, a reasonable profit to the licensee, fees for similar services charged in other communities, and the welfare of the taxicab and taximeter industries.</span>
