No person, except a dealer in rifles and shotguns, may dispose of to another person an ammunition feeding device which is designed for use in a rifle or shotgun
    and which is capable of holding more than five rounds of rifle or shotgun ammunition, except in the manner provided in this chapter for the disposition of assault weapons, provided that a person in lawful possession of such ammunition feeding devices
    may dispose of such ammunition feeding devices to a dealer in rifles and shotguns. No dealer in rifles and shotguns may dispose of such ammunition feeding devices except to a person who is exempt from subdivision a of <a href='/adc/sections/10-303.1.html'>section 10-303.1</a> pursuant to
    <a href='/adc/sections/10-305.html'>section 10-305</a>. b. No person may possess an ammunition feeding device which is designed for use in a rifle or shotgun and which is capable of holding more than five rounds of rifle or shotgun ammunition, unless such person is exempt from subdivision
    a of <a href='/adc/sections/10-303.1.html'>section 10-303.1</a> pursuant to <a href='/adc/sections/10-305.html'>section 10-305</a>, provided that a dealer in rifles and shotguns may possess such ammunition feeding devices for the purpose of disposition authorized pursuant to subdivision a of this section. c. No ammunition suitable
    for use in a rifle of any caliber or for any shotgun or ammunition feeding device which is designed for use in a rifle or shotgun and which is capable of holding no more than five rounds of rifle or shotgun ammunition shall be disposed of to any person
    who has not been issued a rifle and shotgun permit and a certificate of registration and who does not exhibit same to the dealer at the time of the purchase. In no event shall rifle or shotgun ammunition be disposed of to or possessed by any such
    person except for a shotgun, or for the specific caliber of rifle, for which the certificate of registration has been issued. No ammunition feeding device which is designed for use in a rifle or shotgun and which is capable of holding more than five
    rounds of rifle or shotgun ammunition shall be disposed of by a dealer in rifles and shotguns to any person who does not exhibit proof that he or she is exempt from subdivision a of <a href='/adc/sections/10-303.1.html'>section 10-303.1</a> pursuant to <a href='/adc/sections/10-305.html'>section 10-305</a>. d. It shall be unlawful
    for any person who is required to have a permit in order to possess a rifle or shotgun and who has not been issued such permit to possess rifle or shotgun ammunition or an ammunition feeding device which is designed for use in a rifle or shotgun.
    e. A record shall be kept by the dealer of each disposition of ammunition or ammunition feeding devices under this section which shall show the type, caliber and quantity of ammunition or ammunition feeding devices disposed of, the name and address
    of the person receiving same, the caliber, make, model, manufacturer&#39;s name and serial number of the rifle or shotgun for which the purchaser is purchasing ammunition, the date and time of the transaction, and the number of the permit and certificate
    exhibited or description of the proof of exemption exhibited as required by this section. Such information shall be made available to all law enforcement agencies. f. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, ammunition and ammunition feeding
    devices which are designed for use in rifles or shotguns and which are capable of holding no more than five rounds of rifle or shotgun ammunition may be disposed of or possessed in the same manner and pursuant to the same requirements, rules and exemptions
    as apply to disposal or possession of rifles, shotguns or assault weapons under this chapter, provided that a special theatrical permittee may not possess live ammunition suitable for use in the rifle, shotgun or assault weapon such permittee is authorized
    to possess. Ammunition feeding devices which are designed for use in rifles or shotguns and which are capable of holding more than five rounds of rifle or shotgun ammunition may only be disposed of or possessed in the manner provided in this section.
    g. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, any person authorized to possess a pistol or revolver within the city of New York may possess ammunition suitable for use in such pistol or revolver and a dealer in firearms or dealer in rifles
    and shotguns may dispose of such ammunition to such person pursuant to subdivision i of <a href='/adc/sections/10-131.html'>section 10-131</a>. h. Dealers in rifles and shotguns and special theatrical dealers may lease ammunition feeding devices which are designed for use in rifles or shotguns
