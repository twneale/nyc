                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/adc/sections/16-201.html'>§ 16-201</a> Facility assignment. a. The commissioner is authorized and empowered to promulgate regulations and procedures for the management on a city-wide basis of all solid waste generated or disposed of within the city and to supervise and regulate
    the transportation and disposition of all solid waste generated or disposed of within the city pursuant to the standards established herein, provided that no regulation shall abridge, impair or restrict any bona fide firm contracts for the purchase
    or delivery of solid waste for resource recovery entered into between private parties prior to the date at which final notice of regulations is filed with th city clerk, and that any such regulations are accompanied by a justification of such regulations
    that demonstrates either: (1) That regulating privately collected solid waste or a portion of such waste, whether by waste origin, destination, type or by any other reasonable basis will, in the opinion of the commissioner, help facilitate the construction,
    expansion, rehabilitation or operation, by or for the city, of a solid waste recovery and management facility, or will help the city discharge its responsibilites with respect to the management, including trasportation and disposition, on a city-wide
    basis, of all solid waste generated or disposed of within the city, or (2) That a declaration of imminent peril to the public health has been authorized by the board of health and such situation can be addressed or prevented by regulating the disposal
    of privately collected waste. b. The commissioner may assign to persons who collect or dispose of solid waste a solid waste recovery and management facility or facilities at which such persons shall deliver such waste. The commissioner may assign
    days and hours when such persons shall use such facilities, and may limit or prohibit collection truck traffic on particular streets or limit such traffic to certain hours of the day. c. The commissioner shall weigh as one critical consideration in
    his ultimate determination of specific site assignments for disposal, the minimization of solid waste disposal vehicle traffic and transportation cost on city streets and roadways. d. The commissioner shall further consider the following objectives
    in determining facility assignments: (1) meeting the daily operating capacity requirements of each resource recovery facility and minimizing overloading of facilities: (2) extending the useful life of existing municipal landfills; (3) ensuring the
    economic viability of resource recovery facilities processing waste generated within the city; (4) ensuring that unacceptable wastes do not enter facilities; (5) meeting any contractual obligations required under any resolution or resolutions authorizing
    the issuance of bonds for solid waste recovery and management facilities, or entered into pursuant to chapter five hundred sixty of the laws of nineteen hundred eighty; (6) achieving uniform deliveries and minimizing congestion and dumping delays
    at facilities. e. The commissioner shall exercise due diligence in notifying each person assigned to a facility of a scheduled closing of such facility by certified mail at least seventy-two hours prior to such closing. Such notification shall include
    the expected duration of the closing and assignments to alternative facilities and days and times of such assignments. f. The commissioner shall exercise due diligence in notifying persons assigned to a facility of an emergency closing of a facility
    or any emergency during which facilities are not available. Unless the commissioner provides alternative facilities persons assigned to a closed or unavialable facility may arrange alternative means of disposal during the closing or unavailability
    of such facilities.</span>
