                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/adc/sections/10-171.html'>§ 10-171</a>. Prohibited acts during a local state of emergency. a. Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following terms shall have the following meanings: 1. &quot;Essential goods or services&quot; shall mean those goods or services provided by utilities,
    government or private entities or personnel that are necessary to sustain or safeguard a person or property and without which a person or property is vulnerable to harm or damage. Such term shall include, but not be limited to, electricity, heat or
    gas service; mass transportation; telecommunications; fire-fighting, police, armed-forces, emergency medical, or hospital service; the availability of sufficient and appropriate food and clothing; temperate, sanitary, and safe shelter; potable water;
    and fuel. 2. &quot;Local state of emergency&quot; shall mean the period of time during which a proclamation issued by the mayor, declaring a local state of emergency pursuant to executive law section twenty-four, is in effect. 3. &quot;Mandatory evacuation period&quot;
    shall mean the period of time during which the occupancy and use of buildings and homes is prohibited for public safety purposes in response to a natural or man-made disaster, as determined by the mayor pursuant to section twenty-four of the executive
    law, and as declared by the mayor in an executive order during the pendency of a local state of emergency. 4. &quot;Mandatory evacuation zone&quot; shall mean any area where the occupancy and use of buildings and dwellings is prohibited for public safety purposes
    in response to a natural or man-made disaster as determined by the mayor pursuant to section twenty-four of the executive law, and as declared by the mayor in an executive order during the pendency of a local state of emergency. b. Prohibited acts.
    During a local state of emergency, in a mandatory evacuation zone for the duration of a mandatory evacuation period, or when the conduct described below occurs during the reduction or loss of essential goods or services as a result of such emergency,
    it shall be unlawful for any person to: (1) intentionally or recklessly cause, or create a material risk of, physical injury to a person; (2) intentionally or recklessly damage, create material risk of damage to, or wrongfully deprive another person
    of property; (3) knowingly enter or remain unlawfully in a building or upon real property of another person; (4) intentionally or recklessly impede, or cause a material risk of impeding, response to the circumstances of the emergency by any governmental
    agency, officer or employee; or (5) impersonate another with the intent to obtain a benefit, or to injure or defraud a person; provided, however, that such conduct shall also constitute a violation of this section if it occurs after the period of
    a local state of emergency where such conduct is related to circumstances surrounding or arising out of the emergency. c. Affirmative defense. In any prosecution under this section, it is an affirmative defense that the defendant&#39;s conduct constituted
    reasonable action taken as a result of or in response to the emergency. d. Penalties. Any person who violates subdivision b of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment of not more than six months and a fine of not more
    than two thousand five hundred dollars, or a civil penalty of not less than one thousand dollars and not more than five thousand dollars, or both; provided, however, that if the person harmed or the real or personal property affected is located in
    a mandatory evacuation zone and such violation occurs during a mandatory evacuation period, then the perpetrator of such act shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment of not more than one year and a fine of not more than five thousand
    dollars, or a civil penalty of not less than five thousand dollars and not more than ten thousand dollars, or both. e. Each violation of subdivision b of this section shall be deemed a separate offense for which a separate criminal fine or civil penalty
    may be imposed. Penalties imposed pursuant to this section shall not be deemed to limit or preclude any remedy, penalty, or cause of action available under any other law. f. It shall not constitute a defense to an enforcement action taken pursuant
    to this section that the real or personal property entered, damaged, or taken has been previously damaged under the circumstances of or in connection with the events associated with the declaration of a local state of emergency.</span>
