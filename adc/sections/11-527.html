                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-527.html'>§ 11-527</a> Limitation on credit or refund. (a) General. Claim for credit or refund of an overpayment of tax shall be filed by the taxpayer within three years from the time the return was filed or two years from the time the tax was paid, whichever of
    such periods expires the later, or if no return was filed, within two years from the time the tax was paid. If the claim is filed within the three year period, the amount of the credit or refund shall not exceed the portion of the tax paid within
    the three years immediately preceding the filing of the claim plus the period of any extension of time for filing the return. If the claim is not filed within the three year period, but is filed within the two year period, the amount of the credit
    or refund shall not exceed the portion of the tax paid during the two years immediately preceding the filing of the claim. Except as otherwise provided in this section, if no claim is filed, the amount of a credit or refund shall not exceed the amount
    which would be allowable if a claim had been filed on the date the credit or refund is allowed. (b) Extension of time by agreement. If an agreement under the provisions of paragraph two of subdivision (c) of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-523.html'>section 11-523</a> of this chapter (extending
    the period for assessment of income tax) is made within the period prescribed in subdivision (a) of this section for the filing of a claim for credit or refund the period for filing a claim for credit or refund, or for making credit or refund if no
    claims filed, shall not expire prior to six months after the expiration of the period within which an assessment may be made pursuant to the agreement or any extension thereof. The amount of such credit or refund shall not exceed the portion of the
    tax paid after the execution of the agreement and before the filing of the claim or the making of the credit or refund, as the case may be, plus the portion of the tax paid within the period which would be applicable under subdivision (a) of this
    section if a claim had been filed on the date the agreement was executed. (c) Notice of change or correction of federal or New York state taxable income. If a taxpayer is required by <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-519.html'>section 11-519</a> of this chapter to report a change or correction
    in federal or New York state taxable income reported on the taxpayer&#39;s federal or New York state income tax return, or to report a change or correction which is treated in the same manner as if it were an overpayment for federal or New York state
    income tax purposes, or to file an amended return with the commissioner of finance, claim for credit or refund of any resulting overpayment of tax shall be filed by the taxpayer within two years from the time the notice of such change or correction
    or such amended return was required to be filed with the commissioner of finance. If the report or amended return required by <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-519.html'>section 11-519</a> of this chapter is not filed within the ninety day period therein specified, no interest shall be payable
    on any claim for credit or refund of the overpayment attributable to the federal or New York state change or correction. The amount of such credit or refund shall not exceed the amount of the reduction in tax attributable to such federal or New York
    state change, correction or items amended on the taxpayer&#39;s amended federal or New York state income tax return. This subdivision shall not affect the time within which or the amount for which a claim for credit or refund may be filed apart from this
    subdivision. (d) Overpayment attributable to net operating loss carryback. A claim for credit or refund of so much of an overpayment as is attributable to the application to the taxpayer of a net operating loss carryback shall be filed within three
    years from the time the return was due for the taxable year of the loss, or within the period prescribed in subdivision (b) of this section in respect of such taxable year, or within the period prescribed in subdivision (c) of this section, where
    applicable in respect of the taxable year to which the net operating loss is carried back, whichever expires the latest. (e) Failure to file claim within prescribed period. No credit or refund shall be allowed or made, except as provided in subdivision
    (f) of this section or subdivision (d) of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-530.html'>section 11-530</a> of this chapter after the expiration of the applicable period of limitation specified in this chapter unless a claim for credit or refund is filed by the taxpayer within such period. Any later
    credit shall be void and any later refund erroneous. No period of limitations specified in any other law shall apply to the recovery by a taxpayer of moneys paid in respect of taxes under this chapter. (f) Effect of petition to tax appeals tribunal.
    If a notice of deficiency for a taxable year has been mailed to the taxpayer under <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-521.html'>section 11-521</a> of this chapter and if the taxpayer files a timely petition with the tax appeals tribunal under <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-529.html'>section 11-529</a> of this chapter, the tax appeals tribunal
    may determine that the taxpayer has made an overpayment for such year (whether or not it also determines a deficiency for such year). No separate claim for credit or refund for such year shall be filed, and no credit or refund for such year shall
    be allowed or made, except: (1) as to overpayments determined by a decision of the tax appeals tribunal which has become final; (2) as to any amount collected in excess of an amount computed in accordance with the decision of the tax appeals tribunal
    which has become final; (3) as to any amount collected after the period of limitation upon the making of levy for collection has expired; and (4) as to any amount claimed as a result of a change or correction described in subdivision (c) of this section.
    (g) Limit on amount of credit or refund. The amount of overpayment determined under subdivision (f) of this section shall, when the decision of the tax appeals tribunal has become final, be credited or refunded in accordance with subdivision (a) of
    <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-526.html'>section 11-526</a> of this chapter and shall not exceed the amount of tax which the tax appeals tribunal determines as part of its decision was paid: (1) after the mailing of the notice of deficiency, or (2) within the period which would be applicable
    under subdivision (a), (b) or (c) of this section, if on the date of the mailing of the notice of deficiency a claim has been filed (whether or not filed) stating the grounds upon which the tax appeals tribunal finds that there is an overpayment.
    (h) Early return. For purposes of this section, any return filed before the last day prescribed for the filing thereof shall be considered as filed on such last day, determined without regard to any extension of time granted the taxpayer. (i) Prepaid
    tax. For purposes of this section, any tax paid by the taxpayer before the last day prescribed for its payment and any amount paid by the taxpayer as estimated tax for a taxable year shall be deemed to have been paid by the taxpayer on the fifteenth
    day of the fourth month following the close of his or her taxable year with respect to which such amount constitutes a credit or payment. (j) Cross reference. For provision barring refund of overpayment credited against tax of a succeeding year, see
    subdivision (d) of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-526.html'>section 11-526</a> of this chapter. (k) Notice of change or correction of sales and compensating use tax liability. If a taxpayer is required by <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-519.1.html'>section 11-519.1</a> of this chapter to file a report or amended return or report in respect
    of a change or correction of his or her sales and compensating use tax liability, claim for credit or refund of any resulting overpayment of tax shall be filed by the taxpayer within two years from the time such report or amended return or report
    was required to be filed with the commissioner of finance. The amount of such credit or refund shall be computed without change of the allocation of income upon which the taxpayer&#39;s return (or any additional assessment) was based, and shall not exceed
    the amount of the reduction in tax attributable to such change or correction of sales and compensating use tax liability. This subdivision shall not affect the time within which or the amount for which a claim for credit or refund may be filed apart
    from this subdivision.
