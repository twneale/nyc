                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/adc/sections/11-1614.html'>§ 11-1614</a> Proceedings to recover tax. a. Whenever any seller or supplier or retailer or other person shall fail to pay any tax, penalty or interest imposed by this chapter as therein provided, the corporation counsel shall, upon the request of the commissioner
    of finance bring or cause to be brought an action to enforce the payment of the same on behalf of the city of New York in any court of the state of New York or of any other state or of the United States. If, however, the commissioner of finance in
    his or her discretion believes that any such seller or supplier or retailer or other person is about to cease business, leave the state or remove or dissipate the assets out of which the tax, penalties or interest might be satisfied, and that any
    such tax, penalty or interest will not be paid when due, the commissioner of finance may declare such tax, penalty or interest to be immediately due and payable and may issue a warrant immediately. b. As an additional or alternate remedy, the commissioner
    of finance may issue a warrant, directed to the city sheriff commanding the city sheriff to levy upon and sell the real and personal property of the seller or supplier or retailer or other person liable for the tax, which may be found within the city,
    for the payment of the amount thereof, with any penalties and interest, and the cost of executing the warrant, and to return such warrant to the commissioner of finance and to pay to the commissioner of finance the money collected by virtue thereof
    within sixty days after the receipt of such warrant. The city sheriff shall within five days after the receipt of the warrant file with the county clerk a copy thereof, and thereupon such clerk shall enter in the judgment docket the name of the person
    mentioned in the warrant and the amount of the tax, penalties and interest for which the warrant is issued and the date when such copy is filed. Thereupon the amount of such warrant so docketed shall become a lien upon the title to and interest in
    real and personal property of the person against whom the warrant is issued. The city sheriff shall then proceed upon the warrant, in the same manner, and with like effect, as that provided by law in respect to executions issued against property upon
    judgments of a court of record, and for services in executing the warrant the city sheriff shall be entitled to the same fees, which he or she may collect in the same manner. In the discretion of the commissioner of finance a warrant of like terms,
    force and effect may be issued and directed to any officer or employee of the department of finance, and in the execution thereof such officer or employee shall have all the powers conferred by law upon sheriffs, but shall be entitled to no fee or
    compensation in excess of the actual expenses paid in the performance of such duty. If a warrant is returned not satisfied in full, the commissioner of finance may from time to time issue new warrants and shall also have the same remedies to enforce
    the amount due thereunder as if the city had recovered judgment therefor and execution thereon had been returned unsatisfied. c. Whenever a seller or supplier or the retailer shall make a sale, transfer, or assignment in bulk of any part of the whole
    of his or her fixtures, or of his or her stock of merchandise, or of stock or merchandise and of fixtures pertaining to the conduct or operation of business of the seller or supplier or the retailer, otherwise than in the ordinary course of trade
    and regular prosecution of business, the purchaser, transferee or assignee shall at least ten days before taking possession of the subject of said sale, transfer or assignment, or paying therefor, notify the commissioner of finance by registered mail
    of the proposed sale and of the price, terms and conditions thereof whether or not the seller, transferor or assignor, has represented to, or informed the purchaser, transferee or assignee that it owes any tax pursuant to this chapter, and whether
    or not the purchaser, transferee or assignee has knowledge that such taxes are owing, and whether any such taxes are in fact owing. Whenever the purchaser, transferee or assignee shall fail to give notice to the commissioner of finance as required
    by the proceeding paragraph, or whenever the commissioner of finance shall inform the purchaser, transferee or assignee that a possible claim for such tax or taxes exists, any sums of money, property or choses in action, or other consideration, which
    the purchaser, transferee or assignee is required to transfer over to the seller, transferor or assignor shall be subject to a first priority right and lien for any such taxes theretofore or thereafter determined to be due from the seller, transferor
    or assignor to the city, and the purchaser, transferee or assignee is forbidden to transfer to the seller, transferor or assignor any such sums of money, property or choses in action to the extent of the amount of the city&#39;s claim. For failure to
    comply with the provisions of this subdivision, the purchaser, transferee or assignee, in addition to being subject to the liabilities and remedies imposed under the provisions of article six of the uniform commercial code, shall be personally liable
    for the payment to the city of any such taxes theretofore or thereafter determined to be due to the city from the seller, transferor or assignor, and such liability may be assessed and enforced in the same manner as the liability for tax under this
    chapter. d. The commissioner of finance, if he or she finds that the interests of the city will not thereby be jeopardized, and upon such conditions as the commissioner of finance may require, may release any property from the lien of any warrant
    or vacate such warrant for unpaid taxes, additions to tax, penalties and interest filed pursuant to subdivision b of this section, and such release or vacating of the warrant may be recorded in the office of any recording officer in which such warrant
    has been filed. The clerk shall thereupon cancel and discharge as of the original date of docketing the vacated warrant.</span>
