                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/adc/sections/11-1923.html'>§ 11-1923</a> Notice of deficiency. (a) General. If upon examination of a taxpayer&#39;s return under this chapter the commissioner determines that there is a deficiency of tax, he or she may mail a notice of deficiency to the taxpayer. If a taxpayer fails
    to file a return required under this chapter, the commissioner is authorized to estimate the taxpayer&#39;s wages and net earnings from self-employment or the wages from which taxes are required to be deducted and withheld and the tax thereon, from any
    information in the commissioner&#39;s possession, and to mail a notice of deficiency to the taxpayer. A notice of deficiency shall be mailed by certified or registered mail to the taxpayer at such taxpayer&#39;s last known address in or out of the city. If
    the taxpayer is deceased or under a legal disability, a notice of deficiency may be mailed to or her last know address in or out of the city, unless the commissioner has received notice of the existence of a fiduciary relationship with respect to
    the taxpayer. (b) Notice of deficiency as assessment. The notice of deficiency shall be an assessment of the amount of tax specified in such notice, together with the interest, additions to tax and penalties stated in such notice. (c) Restrictions
    on collection and levy. No notice and demand for payment of an assessment of a deficiency in tax made by a notice of deficiency and no levy or proceeding in court for its collection shall be made, begun or prosecuted, except as otherwise provided
    in <a href='/adc/sections/11-1937.html'>section 11-1937</a> of this subchapter, until the expiration of the time for filing a petition contesting such notice, nor, if a petition with respect to the taxable year has been filed with the commissioner, until the decision of the commissioner
    has become final. After a petition has been filed the restriction provided herein shall not apply to such part of the deficiency as is not contested by the petition. For exception in the case of judicial review of the decision of the commissioner,
    see subdivision (c) of <a href='/adc/sections/11-1932.html'>section 11-1932</a> of this subchapter. (d) Exceptions for mathematical errors. If a mathematical error appears on a return (including an overstatement of the credit for tax withheld at the source or of the amount paid as estimated
    tax), the commissioner shall notify the taxpayer that an amount of tax in excess of that shown upon the return is due, and that such excess has been assessed. Such notice shall not be considered as a notice of deficiency for the purposes of this section,
    subdivision (f) of <a href='/adc/sections/11-1929.html'>section 11-1929</a> of this subchapter (limiting credits or refunds after petition to the commissioner), or subdivision (b) of <a href='/adc/sections/11-1931.html'>section 11-1931</a> of this subchapter (authorizing the filing of a petition with the commissioner based on a
    notice of deficiency) nor shall collection of such assessment be prohibited by the provisions of subdivision (c) of this section. (e) Exception where change in federal or New York state taxable income is not reported (1) If the taxpayer fails to comply
    with <a href='/adc/sections/11-1922.html'>section 11-1922</a> of this chapter in not reporting a change or correction increasing his or her federal or New York state taxable income or self-employment income as reported on such taxpayer&#39;s federal or New York state tax return or in not reporting
    a change or correction which is treated in the same manner as if it were a deficiency for federal or New York state tax purposes or in not filing an amended return or in not reporting the execution of a notice of waiver or an assessment described
    in such section, instead of the mode and time of assessment and collection provided for in subdivision (b) of this section, the commissioner may assess a deficiency based upon such changed or corrected federal or New York state taxable income or self-employment
    income by mailing to the taxpayer a notice of additional tax due specifying the amount of the deficiency, and such deficiency, together with the interest, additions to tax and penalties stated in such notice, shall be deemed assessed and subject to
    collection procedures on the date such notice is mailed unless within thirty days after the mailing of such notice a report of the federal or New York state change or correction or an amended return, where such return was required by <a href='/adc/sections/11-1922.html'>section 11-1922</a>
    of this chapter is filed accompanied by a statement showing wherein such federal or New York state determination of such notice of additional tax due are erroneous. (2) Such notice shall not be considered as a notice of deficiency for the purposes
    of this section, subdivision (f) of <a href='/adc/sections/11-1929.html'>section 11-1929</a> of this subchapter (limiting credits or refunds after petition to the commissioner), or subdivision (b) of <a href='/adc/sections/11-1931.html'>section 11-1931</a> of this subchapter (authorizing the filing of a petition with the commissioner
    based on a notice of deficiency), nor shall the collection of such assessment be prohibited by the provisions of subdivision (c) of this section. If the taxpayer is deceased or under a legal disability, a notice of additional tax due may be mailed
    to his or her last known address in or out of the city, unless the commissioner has received notice of the existence of a fiduciary relationship with respect to the taxpayer. (f) Waiver of restrictions. The taxpayer shall at any time have the right
    to waive the mailing of a notice of deficiency or restriction on collection of the whole or any part of the deficiency, or both, by a signed notice in writing filed with the commissioner. (g) Deficiency defined. For purposes of this chapter, a deficiency
    means the amount of the tax imposed by this chapter, less (1) the amount shown as the tax upon the taxpayer&#39;s return (whether the return was made or the tax computed by the taxpayer or by the commissioner), and less, (2) the amounts previously assessed
    (or collected without assessment) as a deficiency and plus (3) the amount of any rebates. For the purpose of this definition, the tax imposed by this chapter and the tax shown on the return shall both be determined without regard to payments on account
    of estimated tax or the credit for withholding tax; and a rebate means so much of an abatement, refund or other repayment (whether or not erroneous) made on the ground that the amounts entering into the definition of a deficiency showed a balance
    in favor of the taxpayer. (h) Cross reference. For provisions permitting a notice of deficiency under chapter seventeen of this title to be treated as a notice of deficiency under this chapter and permitting a notice of deficiency or a payment for
    which credit or refund is sought under chapter seventeen of this title to be treated as though made under this chapter where the taxpayer has filed a petition under such chapter seventeen for either a redetermination of deficiency or for credit or
    refund, see subdivision (h) of section 11-1736 of this title and subdivision (h) of section 11-1744 of this title.</span>
