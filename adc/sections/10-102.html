It shall be unlawful for any person to equip an automobile with a radio receiving set capable of receiving
    signals on the frequencies allocated for police use, or use or possess an automobile so equipped, without a permit issued by the police commissioner, in his or her discretion, and in accordance with such regulations as the commissioner may prescribe.
    Such permit shall expire one year from the date of issuance thereof, unless sooner revoked by the commissioner, and shall not be transferred from the vehicle in which it was installed at the time the license was issued. The annual fee shall be twenty-five
    dollars for each automobile so equipped. A permit may be renewed upon the payment of a like sum and under like conditions. b. The police commissioner is authorized, in his or her discretion, to issue permits for radio receiving sets capable of receiving
    signals on the frequencies allocated to police use to employees of federal, state and municipal bureaus and departments without requiring the payment of the annual fee herein provided. c. Violations. Any person who shall violate any provision of this
    section, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine of not more than twenty-five dollars, or imprisonment for thirty days, or both.</span>
