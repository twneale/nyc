If a return required by this chapter is not filed or if a return when filed is incorrect or insufficient, the amount of the vault charge due shall be determined by the commissioner of finance from such information
    as may be obtainable and, if necessary, the charge may be estimated on the basis of external indices, including but not limited to the records of the department of transportation, the reports of tax assessors, the reports of inspectors and investigators
    in the offices of the commissioner of finance and commissioner of transportation, and/or other information or factors. Notice of such determination shall be given to the person liable for the payment thereof. Such determination shall finally and irrevocably
    fix the vault charge unless the person against whom it is assessed shall, within ninety days after the giving of notice of such determination, or, if the commissioner of finance has established a conciliation procedure pursuant to <a href='//sections/11-124.html'>section 11-124</a> of
    the code and such person has requested a conciliation conference in accordance therewith, within ninety days from the mailing of a conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner&#39;s confirmation of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding,
    both (1) serves a petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2) files a petition with the tax appeals tribunal, or unless the commissioner of finance of his or her own motion shall redetermine the same. Upon such hearing the tax appeals tribunal
    may require the filing of a certificate signed by a city surveyor specifying the dimensions of the vault. After such hearing the tax appeals tribunal shall give notice of its decision to the person against whom the vault charge is assessed. A decision
    of the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc shall be reviewable for error, illegality or unconstitutionality or any other reason whatsoever by a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules if application therefor is
    made to the supreme court by the person against whom the vault charge was assessed within four months after the giving of the notice of such tax appeals tribunal decision. A proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules
    shall not be instituted by a person against whom the vault charge is assessed unless (a) the amount of any vault charge sought to be reviewed, with penalties and interest thereon, if any, shall be first deposited with the commissioner of finance and
    there shall be filed with the commissioner of finance an undertaking in such amount and with such sureties as a justice of the supreme court shall approve, to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or the vault charge confirmed the person
    against whom the vault charge is assessed will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of the proceeding, or (b) at the option of such person, such undertaking filed with the commissioner of finance may be in a sum sufficient
    to cover the vault charge, penalties and interest thereon stated in such decision plus the costs and charges which may accrue against him or her in the prosecution of the proceeding, in which event such person shall not be required to deposit such
    vault charge, penalties and interest as a condition precedent to the application.</span>
