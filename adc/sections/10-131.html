    not apply to a person voluntarily surrendering ammunition or ammunition feeding devices, provided that such surrender shall be made to the police commissioner or the commissioner&#39;s designee; and provided, further, that the same shall be surrendered
    by such person only after he or she gives notice in writing to the police commissioner or the commissioner&#39;s designee, stating his or her name, address, the nature of the property to be surrendered, and the approximate time of day and the place where
    such surrender shall take place. Such notice shall be acknowledged immediately upon receipt thereof by such authority. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as granting immunity from prosecution for any crime or offense except that of unlawful
    possession of such ammunition or ammunition feeding devices surrendered as herein provided. A person who possesses any such ammunition or ammunition feeding devices as an executor or administrator or any other lawful possessor of such property of
    a decedent may continue to possess such property for a period not over fifteen days. If such property is not lawfully disposed of within such period, the possessor shall deliver it to the police commissioner or the commissioner&#39;s designee or such
    property may be delivered to the superintendent of state police. When such property is delivered to the police commissioner or the commissioner&#39;s designee, such officer shall hold it and shall thereafter deliver it on the written request of such executor,
    administrator or other lawful possessor of such property to a named person, provided such named person is licensed to or is otherwise lawfully permitted to possess the same. If no request to deliver the property is received within two years of the
    delivery of such property to such official, he or she shall dispose of it in accordance with the provisions of section 400.05 of the penal law. j. Deceptively colored firearms, rifles, shotguns, and assault weapons. (1) Definitions. (i) When used
