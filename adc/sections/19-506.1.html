If the commission is unable to produce a complaining witness in person, where such witness&#39; credibility is relevant to the charges made in the notice of violation, the commission shall make reasonable efforts to
    make such witness available during the hearing by videoconferencing or teleconferencing. If the complaining witness is not available during a hearing, the commission shall produce a statement outlining its efforts to produce such witness. An administrative
    law judge shall examine such statement and if he or she decides the commission&#39;s efforts to produce the complaining witness were inadequate, the administrative law judge shall dismiss the notice of violation. b. Hearings where the commission seeks
    the revocation of a commission issued license for a rule violation that does not provide for the mandatory revocation of such license as a penalty shall be conducted before the office of administrative trials and hearings and shall be subject to the
    procedures of that tribunal. The commission may authorize other hearings to be conducted before the office of administrative trials and hearings. c. If a respondent timely files to appeal a decision of the administrative tribunal, any fines imposed
    by the administrative tribunal shall be stayed until a decision is made in such appeal, provided that the commission shall not be required to refund any fines paid before respondent made his or her appeal unless such appeal is successful. The administrative
    tribunal shall expedite any appeal involving a suspension or revocation of a commission issued license. d. If, for the purposes of appealing a decision, a respondent requests a copy of the hearing recording, such recording shall be produced to such
    respondent within thirty days after receipt of a written request from such respondent. If the commission cannot produce the recording within the thirty day period, the determination being appealed shall be dismissed without prejudice. e. Notwithstanding
    any other laws, rules or regulations, where a respondent fails to appear at a scheduled hearing, such respondent shall have two years from the entry of any determination to move to vacate such determination and seek a new hearing. After mailing a
    notice of default to a respondent, the commission shall prepare a record containing the name of the person who mailed such notice, and the date, time and method used to mail such notice. The commission shall make such record available upon request
    to such respondent.</span>
