Each service directly supplying a standpipe system or a fire pump shall be equipped with a control valve located under the sidewalk in a flush sidewalk box located
    within two feet of the street line, or in such other locations as may be approved by the department of environmental protection. The purpose of each such control valve shall be clearly indicated by the words &quot;Standpipe Supply Control,&quot; cast in the
    cover of such flush sidewalk box or, in lieu thereof, a metal sign with one inch lettering shall be located on the exterior building wall indicating the use and location of the valve. (b) Water supply to standpipe fire pumps. (1) Any required manual
    or automatic fire pump shall draw from two independent street water mains in different streets, except that: (i) any manual or automatic fire pump serving a building classified in occupancy group J-2 that is fully protected by a system of automatic
    sprinklers may draw from a single water main; and (ii) an automatic fire pump may draw from a single water main if augmented by a suction tank or tanks, and if the valves at the meter and pump are provided with tamper switches that are wired to an
    approved central station of an operating fire alarm company. Where two services are installed, one service from the street water main shall be run directly to the pump, and the other service may be used for domestic water supply. The connection from
    water mains to the pumps shall be at least six inch pipe size and shall be flushed before connection is made to the system. Connections shall be in accordance with subchapter sixteen of this chapter. (2) In the event that two separate and distinct
    water mains are not available as a supply or the street mains cannot produce the required supply, there shall be provided a suction tank, or tanks, suitably located and of sufficient capacity to furnish the fire pump with at least a one-half hour
    supply at the rated capacity of such pump. Suction tanks shall be filled by a six inch connection to the water main, controlled by an automatic ball float valve in the suction tank. A six inch bypass shall be provided so that pumps may be fed directly
    from the street water main. (3) When a water service supplies both the domestic service and the manual fire pump, a remote control valve shall be placed on the domestic service connection at the point where such connection is taken from the city supply
    or service main. Such remote control valve shall be controlled from a point near the pump control panel. In lieu of a remote control valve, a manually operated valve may be installed to shut off the entire domestic water supply to the building, provided
    such valve is located in the fire pump room and is properly tagged for identification.</span>
