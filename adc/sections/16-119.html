                    <span class="" style=""><a href='//sections/16-119.html'>§ 16-119</a> Dumping prohibited. a. It shall be unlawful for any person, his or her agent, employee or any person under his or her control to suffer or permit any dirt, sand, gravel, clay, loam, stone, rocks, rubble, building rubbish, sawdust, shavings
    or trade or household waste, refuse, ashes, manure, garbage, rubbish or debris of any sort or any other organic or inorganic material or thing or other offensive matter being transported in a dump truck or other vehicle to be dumped, deposited or
    otherwise disposed of in or upon any street, lot, park, public place, wharf, pier, dock, bulkhead, slip, navigable waterway or other area whether publicly or privately owned. b. Any person who violates the provisions of this section shall be liable
    to arrest and upon conviction thereof shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished by a fine of not less than one thousand five hundred dollars nor more than ten thousand dollars or by imprisonment not to exceed ninety days or by
    both such fine and imprisonment. c. (1) Any person who violates the provisions of subdivision a of this section shall also be liable for a civil penalty of not less than one thousand five hundred dollars nor more than ten thousand dollars for the
    first offense, and not less than five thousand dollars nor more than twenty thousand dollars for each subsequent offense. In addition, every owner of a dump truck or other vehicle shall be liable for a civil penalty of not less than one thousand five
    hundred dollars nor more than ten thousand dollars for the first offense and not less than five thousand dollars nor more than twenty thousand dollars for each subsequent offense of unlawful dumping described in subdivision a of this section by any
    person using or operating the same, in the business of such owner or otherwise, with the permission, express or implied, of such owner. (2) Any owner, owner-operator or operator who is found in violation of this section in a proceeding before the
    environmental control board and who shall fail to pay the civil penalty imposed by such environmental control board shall be subject to the suspension of his or her driver&#39;s license, privilege to operate or vehicle registration or renewal thereof
    imposed pursuant to section twelve hundred twenty-a of the vehicle and traffic law, in addition to any other civil and criminal fines and penalties set forth in this section. (3) As used in this subdivision, the terms &quot;owner&quot;, &quot;owner-operator&quot; and
    &quot;operator&quot; shall have the meaning set forth in subdivision one of section twelve hundred twenty-a of the vehicle and traffic law. (4) The provisions of this section may also be enforced by the commissioner of small business services and the commissioner
    of environmental protection with respect to wharfs, piers, docks, bulkheads and slips located on waterfront property, and navigable waterways. d. In the instance where the notice of violation, appearance ticket or summons is issued for a breach of
    the provisions of subdivision a of this section and sets forth thereon civil penalties only, such process shall be returnable to the environmental control board, which board shall have the power to impose the civil penalties hereinabove provided in
    subdivision c of this section, provided further, that, notwithstanding any other provision of law, the environmental control board shall have such powers and duties as are set forth under section twelve hundred twenty-a of the vehicle and traffic
    law. e. (1) Any dump truck or other vehicle that has been used or is being used to violate the provisions of this section shall be impounded by the department and shall not be released until either all removal charges and storage fees and the applicable
    fine have been paid or a bond has been posted in an amount satisfactory to the commissioner or as otherwise provided in paragraph (2) of this subdivision. The commissioner shall have the power to establish regulations concerning the impoundment and
    release of vehicles and the payment of removal charges and storage fees for such vehicles, including the amounts and rate thereof. (2) In addition to any other penalties provided in this section, the interest of an owner as defined in subdivision
    c of this section in any vehicle impounded pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision shall be subject to forfeiture upon notice and judicial determination thereof if such owner (i) has been convicted of or found liable for a violation of this
    section in a civil or criminal proceeding or in a proceeding before the environmental control board three or more times, all of which violations were committed within an eighteen month period or (ii) has been convicted of or found liable for a violation
    of this section in a civil or criminal proceeding or in a proceeding before the environmental control board if the material unlawfully dumped is a material identified as a hazardous waste or an acute hazardous waste in regulations promulgated pursuant
    to section 27-0903 of the environmental conservation law. (3) Except as hereinafter provided, the city agency having custody of a vehicle, after judicial determination of forfeiture, shall no sooner than thirty days after such determination upon a
    notice of at least five days, sell such forfeited vehicle at public sale. Any person, other than an owner whose interest is forfeited pursuant to this section, who establishes a right of ownership in a vehicle, including a part ownership or security
    interest, shall be entitled to delivery of the vehicle if such person: (i) redeems the ownership interest which was subject to forfeiture by payment to the city of the value thereof; and (ii) pays the reasonable expenses of the safekeeping of the
    vehicle between the time of seizure and such redemption; and (iii) asserts a claim within thirty days after judicial determination of forfeiture. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions establishment of a claim shall not entitle such person to delivery
    of the vehicle if the city establishes that the unlawful dumping for which the vehicle was seized was expressly or impliedly permitted by such person. f. Rewards. (1) Where a notice of violation, appearance ticket or summons is issued for a violation
    of subdivision a of this section based upon a sworn statement by one or more individuals and where the commissioner determines, in the exercise of his or her discretion, that such sworn statement, either alone or in conjunction with testimony at a
    civil or criminal proceeding or in a proceeding before the environmental control board, results in the conviction of or the imposition of a civil penalty upon any person for a violation of subdivision a of this section, the commissioner shall offer
    as a reward to such individual or individuals an amount that, in the aggregate, is equal to: (i) fifty percent of any fine or civil penalty collected; or (ii) five hundred dollars when a conviction is obtained, but no fine or civil penalty is imposed.
    (2) Where a notice of violation, appearance ticket or summons is issued for a violation of subdivision a of this section based upon information furnished by an individual or individuals and where the commissioner determines, in the exercise of his
    or her discretion, that such information, in conjunction with enforcement activity conducted by the department or another governmental entity, results in the conviction of or the imposition of a civil penalty upon any person for a violation of subdivision
    a of this section, the commissioner shall offer as a reward to such individual or individuals an amount that, in the aggregate, is: (i) up to fifty percent of any fine or civil penalty collected; or (ii) up to five hundred dollars when a conviction
    is obtained, but no fine or civil penalty is imposed. In determining the amount of the reward, the commissioner shall consider factors that include, but are not limited to: (a) the quantity and type of the material dumped, deposited or otherwise disposed
    of; (b) the specificity of the information provided, including, but not limited to, the license plate number, make or model or other description of the dump truck or other vehicle alleged to have been used and the location, date or time of the alleged
    violation; (c) whether the information provided by the individual or individuals identified one or more violations of subdivision a of this section; and (d) whether the department has knowledge that violations of subdivision a of this section have
    previously occurred at that location. (3) No peace officer, employee of the department or of the environmental control board, or employee of any governmental entity that, in conjunction with the department, conducts enforcement activity relating to
    a violation of subdivision a of this section shall be entitled to obtain the benefit of any such reward or obtain the benefit of such reward when acting in the discharge of his or her official duties. g. In addition to the foregoing penalties the
    offender shall be required to clear and clean the area upon which the offender dumped unlawfully within ten days after conviction thereof. In the event the offender fails to clear and clean the area within such time such clearing and cleaning may
    be done by the department or under the direction of the department by a private contractor and the cost of same shall be billed to the offender. In the event that the department has cleaned or cleared the area, or has caused the area to be cleaned
    or cleared by a private contractor prior to the offender&#39;s conviction, the offender shall be responsible for the cost of such clearing and or cleaning. Payment by such offender when required by this subdivision shall be made within ten days of demand
    by the department. h. The commissioner shall post a sign in any area where the commissioner deems appropriate because of instances of illegal dumping. Such sign shall state the penalties for illegal dumping and the reward provisions therein.</span>
