    be regarded as salary or compensation for the purposes of any pension or retirement system of which the employee receiving such overtime compensation is a member. Such overtime compensation shall not be regarded as salary or compensation for the purpose
    of determining the right to any increase of salary or any salary increment on account of length of service or otherwise, nor shall the payment of such overtime compensation be construed to constitute a promotion.</span>
