    by any person unless he or she is an employee of and working under the direct supervision of a person authorized to perform such work pursuant to this chapter and the rules of the department. No person shall falsely represent that he, she or it is
    authorized to perform electrical work under a master electrician&#39;s or special electrician&#39;s license or shall use in any advertising the words &quot;master electrician&quot; or the words &quot;licensed electrician&quot; or the words &quot;electrical contractor&quot; or any words
    of similar meaning or import on any sign, card, letterhead or in any other manner unless such person is so authorized pursuant to this chapter and the rules of the department. 2. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of paragraph one of this
    subdivision, the commissioner may authorize business entities engaged in the business of installing, maintaining or repairing communication, signaling, alarm or data transmission systems to perform low voltage electrical work under a certification

    in the making of a false statement in an application for a master electrician&#39;s or special electrician&#39;s license or for certification as a low voltage installer or in an application for approval of a master electrician business or the renewal of a
    license or certificate or in an application for a permit and approval or in any application provided for in this chapter, or in any proof or instrument in writing in connection therewith, or in any examination hereunder, deceive or substitute or cause
    another to deceive or substitute. c. Penalty. Any person, partnership or corporation who shall violate any of the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not less than five hundred dollars nor more than
