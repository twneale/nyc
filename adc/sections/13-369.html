    the balance shall be paid to his or her legal representatives or to such person as such beneficiary, or the spouse or committee so electing, has nominated or shall nominate by written designation duly acknowledged and filed with the board. Option
    2. Upon his or her death, his or her retirement allowance shall be continued throughout the life of and paid to such person as such beneficiary, or the spouse or committee so electing, has nominated or shall nominate by written designation duly acknowledged

    accidental disability retirement allowance under the provisions of this subchapter, the benefits provided pursuant to <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/13-353.html'>section 13-353</a> of this subchapter shall be payable unless the member would otherwise be entitled to a greater benefit pursuant to
    <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/13-348.html'>section 13-348</a> of this subchapter, in which event the greater benefit shall be payable. d. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, for the purpose of electing an option pursuant to this section, the pension board shall notify the surviving spouse
