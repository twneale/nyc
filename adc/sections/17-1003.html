                    <span class="" style=""><a href='//sections/17-1003.html'>§ 17-1003</a> Prescription drug discount card program. a. The department shall develop a prescription drug discount card program which shall be made available to all New York city residents, regardless of age, income, immigration status or health insurance
    coverage status, for the purpose of providing all New York city residents with a prescription drug discount card which may be used to buy prescription drugs at reduced prices at participating pharmacies. Such prescription drug discount card program
    shall enable each user of such program to purchase at a reduced price from a pharmacy that participates in the program any prescription drug that is eligible for a discount through such program. The prescription drug discount card program shall allow
    users to purchase a drug at the lower of either the drug price available through the prescription drug discount card program or the pharmacy&#39;s customary and usual price. Any prescription drug discount card issued pursuant to this section may not be
    utilized in conjunction with another type of prescription drug discount card for the same transaction. b. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to provide any governmental entity other than the department with access to any individually identifiable
    information regarding users of the prescription drug discount card program established pursuant to this section. The department shall keep confidential all information concerning the identity of users of the program and the drugs that such users purchase
    through the program. The department may use such information solely to conduct epidemiological and health planning studies and to provide general information to users about the drugs such users are taking, the conditions for which such users are taking
    the drugs and other services of the department or the city of New York related to such conditions. c. No administrator of the prescription drug discount card program shall provide the prescription drug discount card developed pursuant to this section
    to any resident of the city of New York unless such administrator ensures that a portion of any rebate payments received from drug manufacturers is distributed to users of such program, including pharmacies participating in the program. d. Any duly
    licensed pharmacy willing to comply with the terms and conditions of the prescription drug discount card program shall be permitted to participate in the program.</span>
