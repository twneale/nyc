                    <span class="" style=""><a href='//sections/11-2104.html'>§ 11-2104</a> Payment. The tax imposed hereunder shall be paid by the grantor to the commissioner of finance at the office of the register in the county where the deed is or would be recorded within thirty days after the delivery of the deed by the grantor
    to the grantee but before the recording of such deed, or, in the case of a tax on the transfer of an economic interest in real property, at such place as the commissioner of finance shall designate, within thirty days after the transfer. The grantee
    shall also be liable for the payment of such tax in the event that the amount of tax due is not paid by the grantor or the grantor is exempt from tax. All moneys received as such payments by the register during the preceding month shall be transmitted
    to the commissioner of finance on the first day of each month or on such other day as is mutually agreeable to the commissioner of finance and the register. From the moneys so received by him or her, the commissioner of finance shall set said in a
    special account: (1) the total amount of taxes imposed pursuant to the provisions of paragraph three of subdivision a of <a href='//sections/11-2102.html'>section 11-2102</a> of this chapter including any interest or penalties thereon; (2) fifty percent of the total amount of taxes imposed
    pursuant to the provisions of paragraph four of subdivision a of <a href='//sections/11-2102.html'>section 11-2102</a> of this chapter, including fifty percent of any interest or penalties thereon, provided, however, that where such tax is measured by the consideration for a conveyance
    without deduction for the amount of any mortgage or other lien or encumbrance on the real property or interest therein which existed before the delivery of the deed and remains thereon after the delivery of the deed, the entire amount of tax imposed
    at the rate of one percent on the portion of the consideration ascribable to such nondeductible mortgage, lien or other encumbrance, including any interest or penalties thereon, and fifty percent of the tax on the balance of the consideration, including
    fifty percent of any interest or penalties thereon, shall be set aside in such special account; (3) fifty percent of the total amount of taxes imposed pursuant to the provisions of subparagraph (iii) of paragraph seven of subdivision a of <a href='//sections/11-2102.html'>section
    11-2102</a> of this chapter, including fifty percent of any interest or penalties thereon; (4) fifty percent of the total amount of taxes imposed pursuant to the provisions of paragraph eight of subdivision a of <a href='//sections/11-2102.html'>section 11-2102</a> of this chapter, including
    fifty percent of any interest or penalties thereon; (5) fifty percent of the total amount of taxes imposed at the rate of two percent pursuant to the provisions of clause (ii) of subparagraph A of paragraph one of subdivision b of <a href='//sections/11-2102.html'>section 11-2102</a>
    of this chapter including fifty percent of any interest or penalties thereon; (6) with respect to any conveyance of real property, transfer of an economic interest therein, or any grant, assignment or surrender of a leasehold interest in real property,
    made on or after August first, nineteen hundred eighty-nine and taxable under this chapter, in each instance where the tax rate is in excess of two percent, a portion of the tax received equal to one percent of the consideration subject to the tax
    plus any interest or penalty attributable to such portion of the tax; and (7) notwithstanding anything in subdivision six to the contrary, in each instance where the tax rate imposed pursuant to subdivision e of <a href='//sections/11-2102.html'>section 11-2102</a> of this chapter is
    in excess of one percent, a portion of the tax received equal to one-half of one percent of the total consideration for the real property or economic interest therein conveyed or transferred, plus any interest or penalty attributable to such portion
    of the tax. Moneys in such account shall be used for payment by such commissioner to the state comptroller for deposit in the urban mass transit operating assistance account of the mass transportation operating assistance fund of any amount of insufficiency
    certified by the state comptroller pursuant to the provisions of subdivision six of section eight-eight-a of the state finance law, and, on the fifteenth day of each month, the commissioner of finance shall transmit all funds in such account on the
    last day of the preceding month, except the amount required for the payment of any amount of insufficiency certified by the state comptroller and such amount as he or she deems necessary for refunds and such other amounts necessary to finance the
    New York City transportation disabled committee and the New York City paratransit system as established by section fifteen-b of the transportation law, provided, however, that such amounts shall not exceed six percent of the total funds in the account
    but in no event be less than one hundred seventy-five thousand dollars beginning April first, nineteen hundred eighty-six, and further that beginning November fifteenth, nineteen hundred eighty-four and during the entire period prior to operation
    of such system, the total of such amounts shall not exceed three hundred seventy-five thousand dollars for the administrative expenses of such committee and fifty thousand dollars for the expenses of the agency designated pursuant to paragraph b of
    subdivision five of such section, and other amounts necessary to finance the operating needs of the private bus companies franchised by the city of New York and eligible to receive state operating assistance under section eighteen-b of the transportation
    law, provided, however, that such amounts shall not exceed four percent of the total funds in the account, to the New York city transit authority for mass transit within the city.</span>
