                    <span class="" style="">20-913 Right to sick time; accrual. a. All employees have the right to sick time pursuant to this chapter. 1. All employers that employ fifteen or more employees and all employers of one or more domestic workers shall provide paid sick time to their
    employees in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and the schedule set forth in section 7 of the local law which enacted this section. 2. All employees not entitled to paid sick time pursuant to this chapter shall be entitled to unpaid sick
    time in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and the schedule set forth in section 7 of the local law which enacted this section. 3. All employers that employ fifteen to nineteen employees, and all employers of one or more domestic workers,
    shall provide unpaid sick time in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and the schedule set forth in section 7 of the local law which enacted this section during any period in which, pursuant to the schedule set forth in section 7 of the
    local law which enacted this section, such employers are not required to provide paid sick time but employers that employ twenty or more employees are required to provide paid sick time. b. All employers shall provide a minimum of one hour of sick
    time for every thirty hours worked by an employee, other than a domestic worker who shall accrue sick time pursuant to paragraph 2 of subdivision d of this section. Employers shall not be required under this chapter to provide more than forty hours
    of sick time for an employee in a calendar year. For purposes of this subdivision, any paid days of rest to which a domestic worker is entitled pursuant to section 161(1) of the labor law shall count toward such forty hours. Nothing in this chapter
    shall be construed to discourage or prohibit an employer from allowing the accrual of sick time at a faster rate or use of sick time at an earlier date than this chapter requires. c. An employer required to provide paid sick time pursuant to this
    chapter who provides an employee with an amount of paid leave, including paid time off, paid vacation, paid personal days or paid days of rest required to be compensated pursuant to section 161(1) of the labor law, sufficient to meet the requirements
    of this section and who allows such paid leave to be used for the same purposes and under the same conditions as sick time required pursuant to this chapter, is not required to provide additional paid sick time for such employee whether or not such
    employee chooses to use such leave for the purposes included in subdivision a of <a href='//sections/20-914.html'>section 20-914</a> of this chapter. An employer required to provide unpaid sick time pursuant to this chapter who provides an employee with an amount of unpaid or paid leave,
    including unpaid or paid time off, unpaid or paid vacation, or unpaid or paid personal days, sufficient to meet the requirements of this section and who allows such leave to be used for the same purposes and under the same conditions as sick time
    required pursuant to this chapter, is not required to provide additional unpaid sick time for such employee whether or not such employee chooses to use such leave for the purposes set forth in subdivision a of <a href='//sections/20-914.html'>section 20-914</a> of this chapter. d. 1.
    For an employee other than a domestic worker, sick time as provided pursuant to this chapter shall begin to accrue at the commencement of employment or on the effective date of this local law, whichever is later, and an employee shall be entitled
    to begin using sick time on the one hundred twentieth calendar day following commencement of his or her employment or on the one hundred twentieth calendar day following the effective date of this local law, whichever is later. After the one hundred
    twentieth calendar day of employment or after the one hundred twentieth calendar day following the effective date of this local law, whichever is later, such employee may use sick time as it is accrued. 2. In addition to the paid day or days of rest
    to which a domestic worker is entitled pursuant to section 161(1) of the labor law, such domestic worker shall also be entitled to two days of paid sick time as of the date that such domestic worker is entitled to such paid day or days of rest and
    annually thereafter, provided that notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, such two days of paid sick time shall be calculated in the same manner as the paid day or days of rest are calculated pursuant to the provisions of section
    161(1) of the labor law. e. Employees who are not covered by the overtime requirements of New York state law or regulations, including the wage orders promulgated by the New York commissioner of labor pursuant to article 19 or 19-A of the labor law,
    shall be assumed to work forty hours in each work week for purposes of sick time accrual unless their regular work week is less than forty hours, in which case sick time accrues based upon that regular work week. f. The provisions of this chapter
    do not apply to (i) work study programs under 42 U.S.C. section 2753, (ii) employees for the hours worked and compensated by or through qualified scholarships as defined in 26 U.S.C. section 117, (iii) independent contractors who do not meet the definition
    of employee under section 190(2) of the labor law, and (iv) hourly professional employees. g. Employees shall determine how much earned sick time they need to use, provided that employers may set a reasonable minimum increment for the use of sick
    time not to exceed four hours per day. h. Except for domestic workers, unused sick time as provided pursuant to this chapter shall be carried over to the following calendar year; provided that no employer shall be required to (i) allow the use of
    more than forty hours of sick time in a calendar year or (ii) carry over unused paid sick time if the employee is paid for any unused sick time at the end of the calendar year in which such time is accrued and the employer provides the employee with
    an amount of paid sick time that meets or exceeds the requirements of this chapter for such employee for the immediately subsequent calendar year on the first day of the immediately subsequent calendar year. i. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed
    as requiring financial or other reimbursement to an employee from an employer upon the employee&#39;s termination, resignation, retirement, or other separation from employment for accrued sick time that has not been used. j. If an employee is transferred
    to a separate division, entity or location in the city of New York, but remains employed by the same employer, such employee is entitled to all sick time accrued at the prior division, entity or location and is entitled to retain or use all sick time
    as provided pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. When there is a separation from employment and the employee is rehired within six months of separation by the same employer, previously accrued sick time that was not used shall be reinstated
    and such employee shall be entitled to use such accrued sick time at any time after such employee is rehired, provided that no employer shall be required to reinstate such sick time to the extent the employee was paid for unused accrued sick time
    prior to separation and the employee agreed to accept such pay for such unused sick time.</span>
