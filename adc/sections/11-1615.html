Any person failing to file a return or to pay any tax to the commissioner of finance within the time required by this chapter shall be subject to a penalty of five percent of the amount of tax due; plus interest
    at the rate of one percent of such tax for each month of delay excepting the first month after such return was required to be filed or such tax became due; but the commissioner of finance if satisfied that the delay was excusable, may remit all or
    any part of such penalty, but not interest at the rate of six percent per year. Such penalties and interest shall be paid and disposed of in the same manner as other revenues from this chapter. Unpaid penalties and interest may be enforced in the
    same manner as the tax imposed by this chapter. b. Any seller or supplier or any retailer or any officer of a corporate seller or supplier or retailer, failing to file a return as required by this chapter, or filing or causing to be filed or making
    or causing to be made or given or causing to be given any return, certificate, affidavit, representation, information, testimony or statement required or authorized by this chapter which is willfully false, and any seller or supplier or any retailer
    or any officer of a corporate seller or supplier or retailer failing to keep the records required by subdivision six of <a href='/adc/sections/11-1602.html'>section 11-1602</a> of this chapter, shall, in addition to the penalties herein or elsewhere prescribed, be guilty of a misdemeanor,
    punishment for which shall be a fine of not more than one thousand dollars or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both such fine and imprisonment. It shall not be any defense to a prosecution under this subdivision that the failure to file
    a return or that the actions or failures to act mentioned in this subdivision was unintentional or not willful. c. The certificate of the commissioner of finance to the effect that a tax has not been paid, that a return has not been filed, or that
    information has not been supplied pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, shall be presumptive evidence thereof.</span>
