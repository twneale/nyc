    shall cause or permit the following unless he or she has first registered with the department: (1) the spraying of any insulating material in or upon any building or other structure during its construction, alteration or repair; (2) the demolition
    of any building or other structure, unless the building or structure is being demolished pursuant to chapter one of title seventeen or article eight of subchapter two of chapter one of title twenty-six of the code. (3) The installation, alteration,

    shall be returned to the registrant, and shall be displayed in accordance with <a href='//sections/24-113.html'>section 24-113</a> of this subchapter. * (f) Registration of equipment or apparatus shall be valid for a period of up to three years from the date of approval of the initial
    registration or renewal, unless sooner revoked or cancelled by the commissioner. Where a registration is renewed after its expiration, the registration fee charged in accordance with the provisions of this part shall be increased on a monthly pro-rated
    basis for the period of time between such expiration and renewal, unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the commissioner that registration was not required under the provisions of this chapter. * NB Amended L.L. 49/85 § 2, language juxtaposed
