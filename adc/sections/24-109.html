    shall cause or permit the following unless he or she has first registered with the department: (1) the spraying of any insulating material in or upon any building or other structure during its construction, alteration or repair; (2) the demolition

    registration or renewal, unless sooner revoked or cancelled by the commissioner. Where a registration is renewed after its expiration, the registration fee charged in accordance with the provisions of this part shall be increased on a monthly pro-rated
    basis for the period of time between such expiration and renewal, unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the commissioner that registration was not required under the provisions of this chapter. * NB Amended L.L. 49/85 § 2, language juxtaposed
