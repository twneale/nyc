Every officer of the city government shall be paid a fixed salary and all fees, percentages or commissions or other money paid to such officer in his or her official capacity, shall be the property of the city. All sums
    so received, including sums received for licenses or permits, shall be paid over not later than the next succeeding business day after receipt thereof, except as otherwise provided by law, to the commissioner of finance without deduction. b. Each
    such officer who shall receive any fees, perquisites, commissions or percentages, or money paid to such officer in his or her official capacity, or any other money which should be paid over to the city, shall make a detailed return to the comptroller,
    under oath, and in such form as the comptroller shall prescribe, showing the amount of all such fees, commissions, percentages, perquisites and money received by him or her since the last preceding statement and return, and showing when, from whom
    and for what reason such money was received. c. The comptroller may require any such officer to make such statement and return to him or her, if it has not been made as herein provided, and he or she shall order the commissioner of finance to withhold
    the salary of such officers until such return is produced, and upon the production of said return the comptroller shall immediately issue a release to the commissioner of finance for the salary so withheld. d. This section shall not apply to city
    marshals.</span>
