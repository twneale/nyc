    otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other law or rule: b. Private residences, except any area of a private residence where a child day care center or health care facility is operated (i) during the times of operation or (ii) during the times
    when employees are working in such child day care center or health care facility areas; provided, however, that a common area of a multiple dwelling containing ten or more dwelling units shall be subject to smoking restrictions. c. Hotel and motel
    rooms occupied by, or available for, occupancy by guests. f. Private automobiles. g. Retail tobacco stores. h. Enclosed rooms in restaurants, bars, catering halls, convention halls, hotel and motel conference rooms, and other such similar facilities
