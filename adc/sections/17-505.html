    otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other law or rule: b. Private residences, except any area of a private residence where a child day care center or health care facility is operated (i) during the times of operation or (ii) during the times
    when employees are working in such child day care center or health care facility areas; provided, however, that a common area of a multiple dwelling containing ten or more dwelling units shall be subject to smoking restrictions. c. Hotel and motel
    rooms occupied by, or available for, occupancy by guests. f. Private automobiles. g. Retail tobacco stores. h. Enclosed rooms in restaurants, bars, catering halls, convention halls, hotel and motel conference rooms, and other such similar facilities

    provided that the operator of such function shall have provided notice to the department of health and mental hygiene in a form satisfactory to such department at least two weeks before such a function begins, and such notice has identified the dates
    on which such function shall occur. No such facility may permit smoking under this subdivision for more than five days in any calendar year.</span>
