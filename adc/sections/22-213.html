The commissioner shall by rule establish fees for the issuance and renewal of registrations and of licenses pursuant to this chapter in amounts sufficient to compensate the city for the administrative
    expense of issuing or renewing a registration or license and the expense of inspections and other activities related thereto. A license issued pursuant to this chapter shall be valid for two years. A business entity that is licensed pursuant to this
    chapter shall provide the commissioner in a form prescribed by the commissioner pursuant to rules promulgated under this chapter with notice of at least ten business days of the proposed addition of a new principal to such business entity. The commissioner
    may waive or shorten such period upon a showing that there exists a bona fide business requirement therefor. Except where the commissioner determines within such period, based on information available to him or her, that the addition of such new principal
    may have a result inimical to the purposes of this chapter, the licensee may add such new principal pending the completion of review under <a href='/adc/sections/22-216.html'>section 22-216</a> of this chapter. The licensee shall be afforded an opportunity to demonstrate to the commissioner
    that the addition of such new principal pending completion of review under <a href='/adc/sections/22-216.html'>section 22-216</a> of this chapter would not have a result inimical to the purposes of this chapter. If upon the completion of such review, the commissioner determines that such
    principal lacks good character, honesty and integrity, the license shall cease to be valid unless such principal divests his or her interest, or discontinues his or her involvement in the business of such licensee, as the case may be, within the time
    period prescribed by the commissioner. b. The commissioner shall be authorized to extend the term of the license for an additional one year period at his or her discretion and shall establish an additional fee therefor. c. A registration issued pursuant
    to this chapter shall be valid for two years.</span>
