All applications for licenses shall be made to the commissioner or the commissioner&#39;s designee in such form and detail as shall be prescribed. Except as specifically provided in chapter two, every application
    shall include the license fee for the full license term. If the license is not issued, the lesser of fifty dollars or one-half of the amount of the annual license fee shall be retained by the department as a non-returnable filing fee. In the event
    a license is issued for less than the full license term, the applicable fee shall be decreased proportionately to the nearest half year, except that in no case shall the fee be less than the fee for one-half year. Where a two year license is surrendered
    for a reason other than suspension or revocation and less than one year of the license term has expired, the licensee may apply for a refund of an amount equal to one year&#39;s license fee. Except as otherwise specifically provided for in chapter two,
    reference to fees, license fees or any other word of similar import shall be deemed to be the license fee for one year. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of this section, whenever the commissioner increases or decreases the term of a type
    of license pursuant to <a href='//sections/20-108.html'>section 20-108</a> of this chapter, the fee for such license shall be increased or decreased proportionately and the amount of refund due upon surrender of such license before the expiration of the term for a reason other than suspension
    or revocation shall be prorated to the unexpired term. * NB Effective until April 16, 2014 * <a href='//sections/20-107.html'>§ 20-107</a> Applications; filing fee; license fee. a. All applications for licenses shall be made to the commissioner or the commissioner&#39;s designee in such

    with such license be conducted. Nothing in this subdivision nor any failure to comply with such preference shall be construed so as to create a cause of action or constitute a defense in any legal, administrative, or other proceeding. c. Except as
    specifically provided in chapter two, every application shall include the license fee for the full license term. If the license is not issued, the lesser of fifty dollars or one-half of the amount of the annual license fee shall be retained by the
