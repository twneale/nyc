                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/adc/sections/11-103.html'>§ 11-103</a> Bond of commissioner and deputy commissioners of finance. The commissioner and any deputy commissioner of finance, within ten days after receiving notice of his or her appointment and before the commissioner enters upon his or her office, shall
    give a bond to the city and to the people of the state of New York in the sum of three hundred thousand dollars, with not less than four sufficient sureties to be approved by the comptroller, conditioned that he or she will faithfully discharge the
    duties of the commissioner&#39;s office and all trusts imposed on him or her by law in virtue of the commissioner&#39;s office, including all duties in connection with the tax on mortgages as prescribed by article eleven of the tax law. Such bond shall be
    deemed to extend to the faithful execution of the duties of the office until a new appointment shall be made and confirmed, and the person so appointed enters upon the performance of the commissioner&#39;s duties. In case of any official misconduct or
    default on the part of such commissioner or any deputy commissioner of finance, or their subordinates, an action upon such bond may be begun and prosecuted to judgment by the city, which, after first paying therefrom the expenses of the litigation,
    shall cause the proceeds of such judgment to be distributed as shall be lawful and equitable among the persons and objects injured or defrauded by such official misconduct or default of the commissioner or any deputy commissioner of finance or any
    of their subordinates.</span>
