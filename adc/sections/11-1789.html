                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-1789.html'>§ 11-1789</a> Petition to tax commission. (a) General. The form of a petition to the tax commission, and further proceedings before the tax commission in any case initiated by the filing of a petition, shall be governed by such rules as the tax commission
    shall prescribe. No petition shall be denied in whole or in part without opportunity for a hearing on reasonable prior notice. Such hearing shall be conducted by one or more members of the tax commission, or by a hearing officer designated by the
    tax commission to take evidence and report to the tax commission. The tax commissioners shall, acting as a body, jointly decide the case as quickly as practicable. Notice of the decision shall be mailed promptly to the taxpayer by certified or registered
    mail at his or her last known address, and such notice shall set forth the tax commission&#39;s findings of fact and a brief statement of the grounds of decision in each case decided in whole or in part adversely to the taxpayer. (b) Petition for redetermination
    of a deficiency. Within ninety days, or one hundred fifty days if the notice is addressed to a person outside of the United States, after the mailing of the notice of deficiency authorized by <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-1781.html'>section 11-1781</a>, the taxpayer may file a petition with
    the tax commission for a redetermination of the deficiency. Such petition may also assert a claim for refund for the same taxable year or years, subject to the limitations of subdivision (g) of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-1787.html'>section 11-1787</a>. (c) Petition for refund. A taxpayer
    may file a petition with the tax commission for the amounts asserted in a claim for refund if: (1) the taxpayer has filed a timely claim for refund with the tax commission, (2) the taxpayer has not previously filed with the tax commission a timely
    petition under subdivision (b) of this section for the same taxable year unless the petition under this subdivision relates to a separate claim for credit or refund properly filed under subdivision (f) of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-1787.html'>section 11-1787</a>, and (3) either: (A) six months
    have expired since the claim was filed, or (B) the tax commission has mailed to the taxpayer, by registered or certified mail, a notice of disallowance of such claim in whole or in part. No petition under this subdivision shall be filed more than
    two years after the date of mailing of a notice of disallowance, unless prior to the expiration of such two year period it has been extended by written agreement between the taxpayer and the tax commission. If a taxpayer files a written waiver of
    the requirement that he or she be mailed a notice of disallowance, the two year period prescribed by this subdivision for filing a petition for refund shall begin on the date such waiver is filed. (d) Assertion of deficiency after filing petition.
    (1) Petition for redetermination of deficiency. If a taxpayer files with the tax commission, a petition for redetermination of a deficiency, the tax commission shall have power to determine a greater deficiency than asserted in the notice of deficiency
    and to determine if there should be assessed any addition to tax or penalty provided in <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-1785.html'>section 11-1785</a>, if claim therefor is asserted at or before the hearing under rules of the tax commission. (2) Petition for refund. If the taxpayer files with
    the tax commission a petition for credit or refund for a taxable year, the tax commission may: (A) determine a deficiency for such year as to any amount of deficiency asserted at or before the hearing under rules of the tax commission, and within
    the period in which an assessment would be timely under <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-1783.html'>section 11-1783</a>, or (B) deny so much of the amount for which credit or refund is sought in the petition, as is offset by other issues pertaining to the same taxable year which are asserted at
    or before the hearing under rules of the tax commission. (3) Opportunity to respond. A taxpayer shall be given a reasonable opportunity to respond to any matters asserted by the tax commission under this subdivision. (4) Restriction on further notices
    of deficiency. If the taxpayer files a petition with the tax commission under this section, no notice of deficiency under <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-1781.html'>section 11-1781</a> may thereafter be issued by the tax commission for the same taxable year, except in case of fraud or with respect
    to a change or correction required to be reported under <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-1759.html'>section 11-1759</a>. (e) Burden of proof. In any case before the tax commission under this chapter, the burden of proof shall be upon the petitioner except for the following issues, as to which the
    burden of proof shall be upon the tax commission: (1) whether the petitioner has been guilty of fraud with intent to evade tax; (2) whether the petitioner is liable as the transferee of property of a taxpayer, but not to show that the taxpayer was
    liable for the tax; (3) whether the petitioner is liable for any increase in a deficiency where such increase is asserted initially after a notice of deficiency was mailed and a petition under this section filed, unless such increase in deficiency
    is the result of a change or correction required to be reported under <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-1759.html'>section 11-1759</a>, and of which change or correction the tax commission had no notice at the time it mailed the notice of deficiency; and (4) whether any person is liable for a penalty
    under subdivision (q) or (r) of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-1785.html'>section 11-1785</a>. (f) Evidence of related federal determination. Evidence of a federal determination relating to issues raised in a case before the tax commission under this section shall be admissible, under rules established
    by the tax commission. (g) Jurisdiction over other years. The tax commission shall consider such facts with relation to the taxes for other years as may be necessary correctly to determine the tax for the taxable year, but in so doing shall have no
    jurisdiction to determine whether or not the tax for any other year has been overpaid or underpaid.</span>
