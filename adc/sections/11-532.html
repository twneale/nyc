                    <span class="" style=""><a href='//sections/11-532.html'>§ 11-532</a> Collection, levy and liens. (a) Collection procedures. The taxes imposed by this chapter shall be collected by the commissioner of finance, and the commissioner may establish the mode or time for the collection of any amount due it under this
    chapter if not otherwise specified. The commissioner of finance shall, upon request, give a receipt for any sum collected under this chapter. The commissioner of finance may authorize banks or trust companies which are depositories or financial agents
    of the city to receive and give a receipt for any tax imposed under this chapter in such manner, at such times, and under such conditions as the commissioner of finance may prescribe; and the commissioner of finance shall prescribe the manner, times
    and conditions under which the receipt of such tax by such banks and trust companies is to be treated as payment of such tax to the commissioner of finance. (b) Notice and demand for tax. The commissioner of finance shall as soon as practicable give
    notice to each person liable for any amount of tax, addition to tax, penalty or interest, which has been assessed but remains unpaid, stating the amount and demanding payment thereof. Such notice shall be left at the dwelling or usual place of business
    of such person or shall be sent by mail to such person&#39;s last known address. Except where the commissioner of finance determines that collection would be jeopardized by delay, if any tax is assessed prior to the last date (including any date fixed
    by extension) prescribed for payment of such tax, payment of such tax shall not be demanded until after such date. (c) Issuance of warrant after notice and demand. If any person liable under this chapter for the payment of any tax, addition to tax,
    penalty or interest neglects or refuses to pay the same within the ten days after notice and demand herefor is given to such person under subdivision (b) of this section, the commissioner of finance may within six years after the date of such assessment
    issue a warrant directed to the sheriff of any county of the state, or to any officer or employee of the department of finance, commanding such person to levy upon and sell such person&#39;s real and personal property for the payment of the amount assessed,
    with the cost of executing the warrant, and to return such warrant to the commissioner of finance and pay to the commissioner the money collected by virtue thereof within sixty days after the receipt of the warrant. If the commissioner of finance
    finds that the collection of the tax or other amount is in jeopardy, notice and demand for immediate payment of such tax may be made by the commissioner of finance and upon failure or refusal to pay such tax or other amount the commissioner of finance
    may issue a warrant without regard to the ten-day period provided in this subdivision. (d) Copy of warrant to be filed and lien to be created. Any sheriff or officer or employee who receives a warrant under subdivision (c) of this section shall within
    five days thereafter file a copy with the clerk of the appropriate county. The clerk shall thereupon enter in the judgment docket, in the column for judgment debtors, the name of the taxpayer mentioned in the warrant, and in appropriate columns the
    tax or other amounts for which the warrant is issued and the date when such copy is filed; and such amount shall thereupon be a binding lien upon the real, personal and other property of the taxpayer. (e) Judgment. When a warrant has been filed with
    the county clerk the commissioner of finance shall, on behalf of the city, be deemed to have obtained judgment against the taxpayer for the tax or other amounts. (f) Execution. The sheriff or officer or employee shall thereupon proceed upon the judgment
    in all respects, with like effect, and in the same manner prescribed by law in respect to executions issued against property upon judgments of a court of record, and a sheriff shall be entitled to the same fees for the sheriff&#39;s services in executing
    the warrant, to be collected in the same manner. An officer or employee of the department of finance may proceed in any county or counties of this state and shall have all the powers of execution conferred by law upon sheriffs, but shall be entitled
    to no fee or compensation in excess of actual expenses paid in connection with the execution of the warrant. (g) Taxpayer not a resident of this state. Where a notice and demand under subdivision (b) of this section shall have been given to a taxpayer
    who is not then a resident of this state, and it appears to the commissioner of finance that it is not practicable to find in this state property of the taxpayer sufficient to pay the entire balance of tax or other amount owing by such taxpayer who
    is not then a resident of this state, the commissioner of finance may, in accordance with subdivision (c) of this section, issue a warrant directed to an officer or employee of the department of finance, a copy of which warrant shall be mailed by
    certified or registered mail to the taxpayer at the taxpayer&#39;s last known address, subject to the rules for mailing provided in subdivision (a) of <a href='//sections/11-521.html'>section 11-521</a> of this chapter. Such warrant shall command the officer or employee to proceed in New
    York county, and such officer or employee shall, within five days after receipt of the warrant, file the warrant and obtain a judgment in accordance with this section. Thereupon the commissioner of finance may authorize the institution of any action
    or proceeding to collect or enforce the judgment in any place and by any procedure that a civil judgment of the supreme court of the state of New York could be collected or enforced. The commissioner of finance may also, in the commissioner&#39;s discretion,
    designate agents or retain counsel for the purpose of collecting, outside the state of New York, any unpaid taxes, additions to tax, penalties or interest which have been assessed under this chapter against taxpayers who are not residents of this
    state, may fix the compensation of such agents and counsel to be paid out of money appropriated or otherwise lawfully available for payment thereof, and may require of them bonds or other security for the faithful performance of their duties, in such
    form and in such amount as the commissioner of finance shall deem proper and sufficient. (h) Action by city for recovery of taxes. Action may be brought by the corporation counsel of the city at the instance of the commissioner of finance as agent
    and trustee for the city to recover the amount of any unpaid taxes, additions to tax, penalties or interest which have been assessed under this chapter within six years prior to the date the action is commenced. (i) Release of lien or vacating warrant.
    The commissioner of finance, if he or she finds that the interests of the city will not thereby be jeopardized, and upon such conditions as the commissioner may require, may release any property from the lien of any warrant or vacate such warrant
    for unpaid taxes, additions to tax, penalties and interest filed pursuant to subdivision (d) or (g) of this section, and such release or vacating of the warrant may be recorded in the office of any recording officer in which such warrant has been
    filed. The clerk shall thereupon cancel and discharge as of the original date of docketing the vacated warrant.
