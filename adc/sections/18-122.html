                    <span class="" style=""><a href='//sections/18-122.html'>§ 18-122</a> Bicycle and tricycle areas in parks. a. Legislative intent. The city council hereby declares that a drastically high number of adults and children are annually killed and injured by motor vehicles while operating bicycles and tricycles in the
    streets of our city and countless pedestrians have been injured by the operation of bicycles and tricycles on sidewalks and pedestrian walks in parks. Although the riding of bicycles and tricycles is healthy and wholesome and a normal activity for
    developing youngsters, the streets and sidewalks of the city of New York are highly congested and, in most areas, dangerous. The safety of the children of New York city requires that a maximum number of off-street areas be developed for the operation
    of bicycles and tricycles in local communities, and it is impossible to adequately meet this problem except by a large centralized riding area in each borough. It is the intent of the council to assure the broad development of such a program by this
    legislation. b. Designation areas. 1. The commissioner shall cause to be created and maintained, in all parks whose total area exceeds five acres, adequate areas appropriately designed for the use of bicycles and of tricycles. 2. Such areas shall
    be designed and constructed in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the commissioner. 3. For purposes of this section, the word &quot;areas&quot; shall mean and include &quot;bicycle paths&quot; at least one mile long in parks whose area is greater than
    twenty-five acres, &quot;bicycle tracks&quot; at least one-quarter of a mile long in parks whose area is greater than five acres, and &quot;tricycle circles&quot; located close to adequate seating space for adults.</span>
