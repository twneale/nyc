(a) No person shall make, continue or cause or permit to be made or continued any unreasonable noise. (b) Unreasonable noise shall include but shall not be limited to sound, attributable to any device, that exceeds the
    following prohibited noise levels: (1) Sound, other than impulsive sound, attributable to the source, measured at a level of 7 dB(A) or more above the ambient sound level at or after 10:00 p.m. and before 7:00 a.m., as measured at any point within
    a receiving property or as measured at a distance of 15 feet or more from the source on a public right-of-way. (2) Sound, other than impulsive sound, attributable to the source, measured at a level of 10 dB(A) or more above the ambient sound level
    at or after 7:00 a.m. and before 10:00 p.m., as measured at any point within a receiving property or as measured at a distance of 15 feet or more from the source on a public right-of-way. (3) Impulsive sound, attributable to the source, measured at
    a level of 15 dB(A) or more above the ambient sound level, as measured at any point within a receiving property or as measured at a distance of 15 feet or more from the source on a public right-of-way. Impulsive sound levels shall be measured in the
    A-weighting network with the sound level meter set to fast response. The ambient sound level shall be taken in the A-weighting network with the sound level meter set to slow response. (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision b of this section,
    where a particular sound source or device is subject to decibel level limits and requirements specifically prescribed for such source or device elsewhere in this code, the decibel level limits set forth in this section shall not apply to such sound
    source or device. (d) The decibel level limits set forth in this section shall not apply to sound attributable to construction devices and activities. (e) Where the commissioner finds that sound from any refuse collection facility regulated by the
    department of sanitation exceeds the decibel level limits set forth in this section, the commissioner shall order the operator of such facility to submit a certification by a professional engineer as to whether or not the facility is in compliance
    with the noise standards required by the department of sanitation rules (16 RCNY Ch. 4) and if not in compliance, the mitigation measures that will be undertaken to bring such facility into compliance. The testing and certification must be submitted
    to the department and to the department of sanitation within forty-five days after the issuance of such order. A facility that complies with an order issued pursuant to this section and with any required mitigation measures shall be deemed to be in
    compliance with the decibel limits of this section. With respect to any refuse collection facility owned or operated by the department of sanitation such facility shall be deemed to be in compliance with the decibel level limits of this section if
    it is in compliance with a best management practices plan developed in conjunction with the department. A notice of violation may only be issued for a refuse collection facility pursuant to this section where the operator of such facility fails to
    comply with an order of the commissioner issued pursuant to this subdivision or the mitigation measures set forth in a certification.
