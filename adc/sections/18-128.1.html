Notwithstanding any other provision of law, general, special or local the city, acting by the commissioner of parks and recreation and the commissioner of cultural affairs with the approval of the board of estimate, is hereby
    authorized and empowered to transfer, grant, demise or let to the Snug Harbor Cultural Center, Inc. or other not-for-profit corporation or corporations, or a local development corporation or corporations, or any combination thereof, their successors
    or assigns (individually or collectively, herein referred to as &quot;NPC&quot;) by contract, lease, license or other instrument, upon such terms and conditions as shall be agreed upon between the city and NPC, the right, for any purpose or purposes referred
    to in subdivisions b and c of this section, to use, occupy, license, lease or carry on or cause to be carried on activities in or on the whole or any part of the tracts of land described in subdivision d of this section, including the buildings and
    other facilities thereon, which tracts are situated in the borough of Staten Island and are commonly known as Snug Harbor. b. Any contract, lease, license, or other instrument referred to in subdivision a of this section may authorize or grant to
    NPC the right to use, occupy, license, lease and carry on or cause to be carried on activities in or on the whole or any part of the tracts of land described in subdivision d of this section for any purpose or purposes which furnish, foster or promote
    for the benefit of the people of the city, cultural development, education, recreation, historic preservation of buildings and improvement of business and commerce, including: theatrical, musical, artistic presentations and exhibitions; meetings,
    assemblages, conventions and conferences; telecommunication systems; events of civic, community and general public interest; and general business or commercial purposes which aid the other purposes set out in this subdivision, provided, however, that
    nothing herein shall grant to NPC the right to conduct any business or commerce, or contract with any other party for the same, unless such business or commerce is compatible with and conducted in conjunction with the use of Snug Harbor cultural center,
    as a multi-purpose cultural center, and further provided that nothing herein shall permit the erection or maintenance of telecommunication towers or other above ground apparatus for telecommunication transmission systems on the grounds of Snug Harbor.
    Subject to the limitations set forth in subdivision c of this section, such land may be used for the purpose of providing residences and work spaces for artists affiliated with the NPC for the duration of such affiliation. It is hereby declared that
    all of the purposes referred to in this subdivision are for the benefit of the health, welfare and prosperity of the people of the city and are public purposes. c. Except as hereinafter provided, the tracts of land described in subdivision d of this
    section shall not be used, occupied, licensed or leased for the purpose of housing. Such land may be used to provide residences for artists who are affiliated with the NPC and who through their work, exhibits, lectures or writings contribute to the
    goals of the NPC. Artists shall only be entitled to occupy such residences for the duration of their affiliation with the NPC and any lease or occupancy permit of a dwelling unit to an artist shall specify that the tenancy or occupancy shall terminate
    upon the termination of the artist&#39;s affiliation with the NPC. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, such dwelling units shall not be subject to regulation or control pursuant to the emergency housing rent control act, the emergency tenant protection
    act of nineteen seventy-four or any local laws enacted pursuant thereto, the emergency housing rent control law, the rent stabilization law of nineteen hundred sixty-nine or any other law which confers rights of occupancy upon tenants which are inconsistent
    with the intent of this subdivision to permit the NPC to provide residences for artists only for the duration of their affiliation with the NPC. The provisions of this subdivision shall not be construed to prohibit the NPC from providing residential
    accommodations to persons employed by the NPC where such residence is necessary for the maintenance or protection of the property such as a resident caretaker, supervisor of maintenance or supervisor of security. d. The tracts of land referred to
