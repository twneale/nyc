    violation, with the burden of proof on the person who received the summons, that he or she was actively engaged in business at the time the summons was issued at a premises located within three city blocks of where the summons was issued. This subdivision
    shall not apply to vehicles owned or operated by gas or oil heat suppliers or gas or oil heat systems maintenance companies, the agents or employees, thereof, or any public utility. c. 1. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph two of this subdivision,
    a violation of this section shall be punishable by the monetary fine authorized for violation of the rules and regulations of the commissioner in paragraph one of subdivision a of section twenty nine hundred and three of the New York City Charter.
    2. A first violation of this section, when the commercial vehicle is a tractor-trailer combination, tractor, truck trailer or semi-trailer, shall be punishable by a monetary fine of two hundred fifty dollars. Any such subsequent violation of this
    section by the same owner, as defined in paragraph a of subdivision one of section two hundred thirty-nine of the vehicle and traffic law, within a six month period shall be punishable by a monetary fine of five hundred dollars. d. Any commercial
    vehicle parked in violation of subdivision a or b of this section shall be subject to impoundment by the department. Any motor vehicle impounded pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision shall not be released until all applicable towing and storage
    fees have been paid. The commissioner shall be authorized to promulgate regulations concerning the procedure for the impoundment of vehicles. e. The sanctions and fees provided for in this section shall be in addition to any other sanctions, fees
    or remedies provided by law or regulation.
