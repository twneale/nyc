    plan or report. c. The manufacturer shall not impose a fee or other charge on any person for the collection, handling, and recycling or reuse of covered electronic equipment or orphan waste, except that a fee or other charge may be imposed by contractual
    agreement between a manufacturer and a business entity, partnership, company, corporation or firm having more than fifty full time employees other than a not-for-profit corporation as defined in subparagraph five or seven of subdivision a of section
    one hundred two of the New York not-for-profit corporation law, association, governmental entity, public benefit corporation or public authority. d. An electronic waste management plan shall include, at a minimum: 1. details for the collection, handling,

    covered electronic equipment; (ii) any brand name under which the manufacturer manufactures and sells, or has manufactured and sold, covered electronic equipment; (iii) any brand name under which the manufacturer sells or has sold covered electronic
    equipment produced by another person under such manufacturer&#39;s own brand; (iv) any brand name that the manufacturer owns and licenses or has licensed to another person for use on covered electronic equipment; (v) any brand name under which the manufacturer

    handling, and recycling or reuse of covered electronic equipment complies with all local, state, federal and international laws and regulations; and 9. any other information as may be required by department rules. e. The department shall approve or
    disapprove a proposed electronic waste management plan submitted by a manufacturer within one hundred eighty days of its submission. The department may approve a submitted electronic waste management plan that does not conform with every one of the
    requirements of this chapter upon application and a showing of good cause by such manufacturer. If the department approves an electronic waste management plan, it shall expeditiously notify the manufacturer of the approval in writing. If the department
    disapproves an electronic waste management plan, it shall expeditiously notify the manufacturer in writing of the disapproval and specify the reasons for such disapproval. The manufacturer shall have thirty days to resubmit a revised electronic waste
    management plan after the department notifies the manufacturer of its disapproval. The department shall approve or disapprove a resubmitted electronic waste management plan within ninety days of resubmission. f. Beginning on July first, two thousand
    nine, or one hundred eighty days after an electronic waste management plan is approved by the department, whichever date is later, a manufacturer of covered electronic equipment shall implement its approved plan for the collection, handling and recycling
    or reuse of covered electronic equipment and orphan waste. g. An electronic waste management plan may provide for the sharing of resources by one or more manufacturers, provided that such plan meets the requirements of this section. Any electronic
    waste management plan providing for the sharing of resources must include a list of manufacturers participating in such plan. h. 1. Proposed modifications to a previously approved manufacturer&#39;s electronic waste management plan shall be submitted
    to the department which shall approve or disapprove such modification within sixty days and expeditiously notify the manufacturer of its determination in writing. If the department disapproves such modification, it shall specify the reasons for such
    disapproval in writing and the manufacturer shall have thirty days to submit a revised modification to the department. 2. At any time, the department may require resubmission of a proposed modification where it determines that the manufacturer is
    not in compliance with the collection standards as set forth in <a href='//sections/16-424.html'>section 16-424</a> of this chapter. The department shall approve or disapprove such modification in accordance with paragraph one of this subdivision. i. Notwithstanding the provisions of
    <a href='//sections/16-423.html'>section 16-423</a> of this chapter, any person who becomes a manufacturer of covered electronic equipment subsequent to the effective date of this section may include within a submitted electronic waste management plan a proposed schedule for compliance
    with the minimum collection standards set forth in <a href='//sections/16-424.html'>section 16-424</a> beyond the respective compliance dates set forth in such section. The commissioner may approve such proposed schedule or may approve a modification to such proposed schedule that provides
    for a reasonable compliance time beyond that provided for in such section. j. All decisions of the department pursuant to this section shall be made public.</span>
