    shall authorize the transport of waste which is asbestos containing material unless all information required in paragraph b has been filed with the department not less than five business days prior to the time such waste is transported. Provided further,
    however, the commissioner may for good cause shown and on such terms and conditions as he or she deems reasonable and necessary permit the filing of such amended plan less than five days prior to the time such waste is transported. d. Copies of all

    necessary to protect the health and safety of workers and the public in connection with work not constituting an asbestos project in which asbestos is or is likely to be disturbed. (h) A notice or order to stop work may be issued by the commissioner,
    or his or her authorized representative, at any time when it is found that work is being performed in violation of the provisions of this section, or any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder and which poses a threat to human safety. Such notice
    or order may be given orally or in writing to the owner, lessee or occupant of the property involved, or to the agent of any of them, or to the person or persons performing the work and may require all persons in or about the building or premises
    to vacate the same forthwith, and also require such work to be done as, in the opinion of the commissioner, may be necessary to remove the danger therefrom. Such notice or order shall be valid for a period of time not to exceed seventy-two hours and
    may be extended only upon application to the board in accordance with the provisions of <a href='//sections/24-178.html'>section 24-178</a> of this code. (i) The commissioner may grant individual variances for asbestos projects at specific sites, from particular requirements related
    to asbestos prescribed by this code and regulations or orders of the commissioner promulgated thereunder, whenever it is found, upon presentation of adequate proof, that compliance with such requirements would impose unreasonable hardship. In granting

    (j) The commissioner may establish a fee to process the applications listed in this subdivision as follows: (1) For any asbestos project not requiring a permit or plan approval issued by the department of buildings and for which an asbestos inspection

    may require the submission of the asbestos investigator&#39;s findings whether or not an asbestos project is planned or scheduled. (m) (1) In addition to submission of the asbestos inspection report or asbestos removal plan, the commissioner may by regulation
    require additional notification to the department prior to the start of the asbestos project. No person shall cause or permit any abatement of asbestos containing material without compliance with any such additional notification requirements. (2)
    Except as specified in subparagraph c of paragraph one of subdivision (e) and subparagraph c of paragraph one of subdivision (f) of this section, the commissioner may prescribe by regulation the circumstances under which an asbestos inspection report
    or asbestos removal plan may be amended, and the circumstances under which a new asbestos inspection report or asbestos removal plan shall be submitted to the department. The commissioner may consider the extent of the proposed amendment, including
    but not limited to change in floor size, quantity of asbestos containing material involved, project phasing, project duration, and replacement of abatement contractor. * (n) The commissioner shall adopt rules specifying the standards for the construction
    of temporary structures for asbestos abatement activities. In addition to any other requirements, such rules shall provide that materials used in the construction of such structures be non-combustible or flame resistant in compliance with reference
    standard NFPA 255-06 or NFPA 701-99, as such standards may be modified by local law or by the Department of Buildings pursuant to applicable rules. * NB There are 2 sb (n)&#39;s * (n) Sharing the results of inspections. The commissioner, in coordination
    with the commissioner of the department of buildings and the fire commissioner, shall establish a procedure to share information regarding violations issued pursuant to this section, in accordance with the requirements of <a href='//sections/28-103.7.html'>section 28-103.7</a>.1 of the
    administrative code of the city of New York. * NB There are 2 sb (n)&#39;s (o) (1) No asbestos abatement activities shall be performed within a building concurrently with demolition work for the full demolition of such building or concurrently with the
    removal of one or more stories of such building, except as provided in this subdivision and the rules of the department. (2) Prior to the issuance of a full demolition permit by the department of buildings, the owner of the building to be demolished
    shall submit to the department of buildings (i) certification, in a form to be provided by the rules of the department of environmental protection, that the building is free of asbestos containing material or, (ii) documentation that the commissioner
    of environmental protection has issued a variance from this requirement pursuant to subdivision (i) of this section and the rules of the department, subject to the additional conditions set forth in paragraph four of this subdivision. (3) Prior to
    the issuance of an alteration permit by the department of buildings to remove one or more stories of a building, the owner of the building shall submit certification to the department of buildings in a form to be provided by the rules of the department
    of environmental protection (i) that the stories to be removed are free of asbestos containing material and that no abatement activities will be performed anywhere in the building concurrently with the removal work authorized by such permit or (ii)
    that the commissioner of environmental protection has issued a variance from these requirements pursuant to subdivision (i) of this section and the rules of the department, subject to the additional conditions set forth in paragraph four of this subdivision.
    (4) Prior to granting any variance pursuant to subdivision (i) of this section relating to the full demolition of a building or the removal of one or more stories of a building that would permit the performance of abatement activities concurrent with
    such demolition or removal work within the same building, the commissioner of environmental protection shall notify and consult with the commissioner of buildings and the fire commissioner regarding the appropriate safeguards for such work. Notwithstanding
    any inconsistent provision of <a href='//sections/24-146.3.html'>section 24-146.3</a> of the administrative code, where a variance is issued to perform abatement activities and demolition or removal work concurrently within the same building, the asbestos abatement activities may not be
    performed without an asbestos permit issued pursuant to <a href='//sections/24-146.3.html'>section 24-146.3</a>, regardless of whether such a permit would otherwise be required to perform such activity. (5) The commissioner shall post on-line within seven days notice of any variance granted
    under this subdivision with a statement of the reasons leading to his or her decision. (6) This subdivision shall not apply to full demolition or the removal of one or more stories performed as emergency work pursuant to article 215 of chapter 2 of
    title 28 of the administrative code where the emergency warrants immediate commencement of the work or full demolition with asbestos in place authorized in accordance with 12 NYCRR 56-11.5.</span>
