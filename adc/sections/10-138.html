                    <span class="" style=""><a href='//sections/10-138.html'>§ 10-138</a> Distribution of a Model Code of Conduct to participants in youth sports programs. a. Legislative findings and intent. Participation in youth sports programs should be a rewarding experience. Through sports programs, our youth learn the importance
    of teamwork, cooperation, effort, discipline and commitment. Furthermore, regular physical activity is the cornerstone of an active and healthy lifestyle. Unfortunately, good sportsmanship is sometimes lacking on the part of coaches, parents, players,
    spectators and other persons involved in youth sports programs, resulting in the creation of a hostile environment for participants. The City Council finds that in order to realize the full potential and value of youth sports programs, participants
    in such programs should follow a Code of Conduct that reflects principles of good sportsmanship at all youth sports events. Furthermore, the City Council finds that organizations that administer youth sports programs should have the option of banning
    coaches, parents, players, spectators and other participants in youth sports programs from attending youth sports events if they engage in certain egregious behavior at such events. Additionally, such organizations should have the option of requiring
    individuals to complete some form of anger management counseling before being allowed to resume attendance at youth sports events. b. Definitions. For purposes of this section: (1) The term &quot;youth&quot; shall mean any person under the age of eighteen.
    (2) The term &quot;organization&quot; shall mean any individual, firm, partnership, trust, association, corporation or other entity. (3) The term &quot;youth sports event&quot; shall mean a competition, practice or instructional event involving one or more youth sports
    teams, where such youth sports teams utilize city facilities and/or receive city funding. c. Any organization that administers a youth sports program that utilizes city facilities and/or receives city funding shall distribute the following Model Code
    of Conduct or a similar Code of Conduct containing guidelines for conduct of behavior to be observed at youth sports events to all coaches, parents and players participating in such sports program: Model Code of Conduct 1. All officials, coaches,
    parents, players, spectators and participants shall respect one another. 2. All officials, coaches, parents, players, spectators and participants shall respect officials&#39; decisions. 3. All officials, coaches, parents, players, spectators and participants
    shall engage in fair play and abide by all game rules. 4. All officials, coaches, parents, players, spectators and participants shall refrain from engaging in taunting of officials, coaches, parents, players, spectators or other participants by means
    of baiting or ridiculing. 5. All officials, coaches, parents, players, spectators and participants shall refrain from verbal and/or profane abuse of officials, coaches, parents, players, spectators or other participants. 6. All officials, coaches,
    parents, players, spectators and participants shall refrain from threatening physical violence or engaging in any form of physical violence. 7. All officials, coaches, parents, players, spectators and participants shall win and lose with good sportsmanship
    and shall strive to make youth sports programs rewarding for all participants. d. Any organization that administers a youth sports program that utilizes city facilities or receives city funding shall post or affix the Model Code of Conduct or a similar
    Code of Conduct containing guidelines for conduct of behavior to be observed at youth sports events at the primary facility where such youth sports events occur, as practicable. e. Any organization that administers a youth sports program that utilizes
    city facilities and/or receives city funding may ban the presence at youth sports events of any official, coach, parent, player, spectator or other participant who (1) engages in verbal or physical threats or abuse aimed at any official, coach, parent,
    player, spectator or other participant, (2) initiates a fight or scuffle with any official, coach, parent, player, spectator or other participant or (3) engages in repeated and egregious violations of the Model Code of Conduct or similar Code of Conduct
    containing guidelines for conduct of behavior to be observed at youth sports events, if the conduct occurs at or in connection with such youth sports event. f. In the event that any official, coach, parent, player, spectator or other participant is
    banned from attending youth sports events pursuant to subdivision (e) of this section, such person may petition the organization that imposed such ban for permission to resume attendance. Prior to being permitted to resume attendance, such organization
    may require such person to present proof of completion of anger management counseling or its equivalent.</span>
