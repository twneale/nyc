    the equivalent of ten percent or more ownership interest of the applicant business. For the purposes of this chapter: (1) an individual shall be considered to hold stock in a corporation where such individual participates in the operation of or has
    a beneficial interest in such corporation and such stock is owned directly or indirectly by or for (i) such individual, (ii) the spouse or domestic partner of such individual (other than a spouse who is legally separated from such individual pursuant

    value of the stock of a third corporation that holds stock in the applicant corporation. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subdivision, where there is reasonable cause to believe that any owner, officer or director of a business entity with
    an interest in an applicant business not otherwise within the scope of this subdivision lacks good character, honesty and integrity, the commission may designate such person as a principal for the purposes of sections 20-954, 20-955, 20-956 and 20-959
    of this chapter. m. &quot;Registrant&quot; shall mean a service employee or agent or an auxiliary vendor who has registered with the commission pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. n. &quot;Service employee or agent&quot; shall mean a person employed in a shipboard

    of the United States from a location within New York city and returned to a location within such city; provided that a business shall not be deemed a shipboard gambling business for purposes of this chapter where the gambling cruises or the gambling
    activities aboard such cruises operated by or on behalf of such business are conducted or proposed to be conducted no more than two times a year or every cruise operated by such business during which gambling activities occur is of at least seventy-two
    hours duration or where the commission determines, in its discretion, that the gambling offered aboard a vessel owned or operated by such business does not constitute a primary activity conducted aboard such vessel. In reaching a determination that
    gambling does not constitute a primary activity, the commission shall consider, without limitation, factors including: the passenger capacity of the vessel in relation to the number of gaming positions in the areas in which gambling will occur; the
    percentage of space devoted to public accommodation in which gambling will occur; the number of hours during which gambling will take place in relation to the total time of the cruise; and the nature of the advertising and other customer solicitation
    engaged in by the business. p. &quot;Subsidiary&quot; shall mean any business that is managed by another business entity or any business in which fifty percent or more of the business is owned or in which fifty percent or more of the business is subject to
    a power or right of control or held with power to vote by another business entity. q. &quot;Vendor&quot; shall mean any business, except for a business the primary function of which is to provide legal or accounting services or that is required to register
    as a lobbyist pursuant to <a href='/adc/sections/3-213.html'>section 3-213</a> of the code or pursuant to the New York state lobbying act (enacted by chapter 1040 of the laws of 1981, as amended) that provides a shipboard gambling business with goods or services used in the operation of
    such business. &quot;Key vendor&quot; shall mean a vendor, in a category identified by rule of the commission, that furnishes goods or services related to the security operations, gambling operations, gambling equipment, the hiring, supervision or training
    of gambling employees or agents, the provision of alcoholic beverages, and the provision of food or food services the cost of which exceeds an amount to be set forth by rule of the commission. &quot;Auxiliary vendor&quot; shall mean a vendor, other than a key
    vendor, that furnishes goods or services to a shipboard gambling business, the cost of which goods or services exceeds an amount to be established for each category of such vendor by rule of the commission, related to maintenance of a vessel or facilities
    or equipment aboard a vessel, food or non-alcoholic beverages, entertainment or such other activity for which the commission determines by rule that registration is necessary or appropriate to effectuate the provisions of this chapter, provided that
    the commission may by rule determine that registration of a specific category of auxiliary vendor is unnecessary to achieve the purposes of this chapter. The commission shall by rule list the categories of goods and services and/or the amount of sales
    of such goods and services that do not require obtaining a key vendor license or an auxiliary vendor registration and may also, in its discretion, waive a requirement for a key vendor license or auxiliary vendor registration upon a determination that
    such license or registration is unnecessary to achieve the purposes of this chapter. In addition, the commission shall establish, by rule, a procedure whereby a shipboard gambling business may obtain temporary permission, on an expedited basis, to
    purchase goods or services from an unlicensed or unregistered vendor in a situation where such purchase is necessary to the operation of such business. The commission shall make provision for the issuance of licenses pursuant to sections 20-954 and
    20-956 of this chapter to key vendors who furnish goods or services to shipboard gambling licensees and for the registration pursuant to <a href='/adc/sections/20-955.html'>section 20-955</a> of auxiliary vendors who furnish goods or services to shipboard gambling licensees. The commission
    shall maintain a list of all licensed and registered vendors and those vendors to whom a waiver has been granted and shall make such list available upon request.</span>
