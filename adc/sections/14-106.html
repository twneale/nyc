                    <span class="" style=""><a href='//sections/14-106.html'>§ 14-106</a> Special patrolmen; when may be appointed. a. The commissioner, upon an emergency or apprehension of riot, tumult, mob, insurrection, pestilence or invasion, may appoint as many special patrolmen without pay from among the citizens as he or
    she may deem desirable. b. Special patrolmen, appointed in pursuance of law while acting as such special patrolmen shall possess the powers, perform the duties, and be subject to the orders, rules and regulations of the department in the same manner
    as regular members of the force. Every such special patrolman shall wear a badge, to be prescribed and furnished by the commissioner. c. The commissioner, whenever expedient, may on the application of any person or persons, corporation or corporations,
    showing the necessity therefor, appoint and swear any number of special patrolmen to do special duty at any place in the city upon the person or persons, corporation or corporations by whom the application shall be made, paying, in advance, such special
    patrolmen for their services, and upon such special patrolmen, in consideration of their appointment, signing an agreement in writing releasing and waiving all claim whatever against the department and the city for pay, salary or compensation for
    their services and for all expenses connected therewith; but the special patrolmen so appointed shall be subject to the orders of the commissioner and shall obey the rules and regulations of the department and conform to its general discipline and
    to such special regulations as may be made and shall during the term of their holding appointment possess all the powers and discharge all the duties of the force, applicable to regular members of the force. d. The special patrolmen so appointed may
    be removed at any time by the commissioner, without assigning cause therefor, and nothing in this section contained shall be construed to constitute such special patrolmen members of the force, or to entitle them to the privileges of the regular members
    of the force, or to receive any salary, pay, compensation or moneys whatever from the department or the city, or to share in the police pension fund. e. The commissioner, upon the application of the head of any agency, public authority exercising
    jurisdiction within the city, or state agency, may appoint and swear any number of officers or employees of such agency or authority to do special duty at any place in the city, on behalf of such agency. The special patrolmen so appointed shall be
    subject to the orders of the commissioner and shall obey the rules and regulations of the department and conform to its general discipline and to such special regulations as may be made and shall during the term of their holding appointment possess
    all the powers and discharge all the duties of a peace officer while in the performance of their official duties. An appointment as a special patrolman may be revoked at any time by the commissioner, without assigning cause therefor, and nothing in
    this section contained shall be construed to constitute such special patrolmen members of the force, or to entitle them to the privileges of the regular members of the force, or to receive any additional salary, pay, compensation or moneys whatever
    from the department or the city by reason of such appointment, or to share in the police pension fund. Every special patrolman appointed pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision is hereby authorized and empowered to proceed under the provisions
    of the criminal procedure law in the same manner and with like force and effect as a member of the force in respect to procuring, countersigning and serving the summons referred to therein. f. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in cases relating
    to violation of the health code and those provisions of the code pertaining to the jurisdiction of the sanitation department employees of such department who are special patrolmen by appointment pursuant to subdivision e of this section may execute
    warrants of arrest and bench warrants in the same manner and with the same powers and immunities as if such special patrolmen were members of the department. The issuance and execution of any such warrant of arrest or bench warrant shall in all other
    respects be governed by the applicable provisions of the criminal procedure law.</span>
