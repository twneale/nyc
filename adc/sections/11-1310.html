If any person fails to pay the tax, or to file a return required by this chapter or if a return, when filed, is insufficient and the maker fails to file a corrected or sufficient return within ten days after the same
    may be required by notice from the commissioner of finance, he or she shall determine the amount of tax due from such information as may be obtainable or on the basis of external indices, such as number of cigarettes purchased or sold, stock on hand,
    volume of sales by similar dealers and/or other factors. Notice of such determination shall be given to the person liable for the payment of the tax. Such determination shall finally and irrevocably fix the tax unless the person against whom it is
    assessed shall, within ninety days of the giving of such notice, or, if the commissioner of finance has established a conciliation procedure pursuant to <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-124.html'>section 11-124</a> of the code and the person liable for the tax has requested a conciliation conference
    in accordance therewith, within ninety days from the mailing of a conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner&#39;s confirmation of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding, both (1) serves a petition upon the commissioner of finance
    and (2) files a petition with the tax appeals tribunal for a hearing, or unless the commissioner of finance shall of his or her own motion redetermine such tax. Such hearing and any appeal to the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc from the decision
    rendered in such hearing shall be conducted in the manner and subject to the requirements prescribed by the tax appeals tribunal pursuant to sections one hundred sixty-eight through one hundred seventy-two of this charter. After such hearing the tax
    appeals tribunal shall give notice of its decision to the person liable for the tax and to the commissioner of finance. A decision of the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc shall be reviewable for error, illegality, unconstitutionality or any other
    reason whatsoever by a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules if instituted by the person against whom the tax was assessed within four months after the giving of the notice of such tax appeals tribunal decision.
    Such proceeding shall not be instituted by a person liable for the tax unless the amount of any tax sought to be reviewed with interest and penalties thereon, if any, shall have first been deposited with the commissioner of finance and an undertaking
    filed with the commissioner of finance in such amount and with such sureties as a justice of the supreme court shall approve, to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, such person will pay all costs and charges which
    may accrue in the prosecution of the proceeding.</span>
