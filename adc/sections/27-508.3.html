It shall be unlawful for any person to place, cause to be placed, to maintain or to cause to be maintained, a tobacco product advertisement within one thousand feet, in any direction, of any school
    building, playground, child day care center, amusement arcade or youth center, in any outdoor area including, but not limited to, billboards, roofs and sides of buildings, rolling shutters or gates, any enclosures into which rolling shutters or gates

    be retained until two years from the effective date of this law. b. It shall be unlawful for any person to place, cause to be placed, to maintain, or cause to be maintained, a tobacco product advertisement in the interior of a building or structure
    which is within one thousand feet, in any direction, of any school building, playground, child day care center, amusement arcade or youth center, when such advertisement is within five feet of any exterior window or any door which is used for entry
    or egress by the public to the building or structure; provided, however, that tobacco product advertisements may be placed or maintained in the interior of any such premises where such advertisements are (i) parallel to the street and face inward,
    or (ii) affixed to a wall panel or similar fixture that is perpendicular to the street regardless of whether such advertisements are illuminated or not illuminated. c. Nothing in this section shall prevent a person from placing, causing to be placed,
