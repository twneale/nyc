    obtain a license to engage in business as a retail dealer, a person shall file an application with the commissioner for a license for each place of business that he or she desires to have for the retail sale of cigarettes in the city. The application
    for each license or renewal thereof shall be made upon such form as prescribed by the commissioner and shall contain such information as the commissioner shall require. c. Fee and license term. 1. There shall be a biennial fee of one hundred ten dollars
    for a license to engage in the business of a retail dealer at each place of business where cigarettes are sold in the city. 2. All even-numbered licenses shall expire on December 31 of the even-numbered year, and all odd-numbered licenses shall expire
    on December 31 of the odd-numbered year, next succeeding the year in which the license is issued. * d. Issuance of license. 1. A license shall be issued to a person to conduct the business of a retail dealer for each place of business where such person
    engages in selling cigarettes in the city only where: (A) an applicant for a license or renewal thereof meets all the requirements prescribed herein and any criteria in addition thereto established by the commissioner by rule as he or she deems necessary
    to effectuate the purposes of this subchapter; (B) an applicant satisfies the commissioner that such person is fit and able to conduct the business of a retail dealer; and (C) the commissioner has not received notification from the commissioner of
    finance or the commissioner of the department of health and mental hygiene that such applicant is not in full compliance with any provisions of chapter thirteen of title eleven of this code, or chapter forty of title eleven of this code relating to
    the sale of cigarettes, or chapter seven of title seventeen of this code, or chapter eight of title seventeen of this code, or any rules promulgated by the commissioner of finance or the commissioner of the department of health and mental hygiene
    to effectuate the purposes of such chapters. 2. A retail dealer license shall not be assignable and shall be valid only for the persons in whose names it is issued and for the transaction of business in the place designated therein and shall at all
    times be conspicuously displayed at the place for which it is issued. 3. Where a license for any place of business licensed pursuant to this subchapter has been revoked, the commissioner in his or her discretion may refuse to issue a license required
    under this subchapter, for a period of two years after such revocation, for such place of business or for any part of the building that had contained such place of business and was connected therewith, unless the applicant for such license demonstrates
    with documentary proof, to the satisfaction of the commissioner, that the applicant acquired the premises or business through an arm&#39;s length transaction. 4. For purposes of revocation of retail dealer licenses pursuant to <a href='//sections/17-710.html'>section 17-710</a> of the code,
    any violation of <a href='//sections/17-704.html'>section 17-704</a>, 17-705 or 17-706, or for purposes of revocation of retail dealer licenses pursuant to <a href='//sections/17-716.html'>section 17-716</a> of the code, any violation of <a href='//sections/17-715.html'>section 17-715</a>, by any license holder at a place of business shall be included in determining
    the number of violations by any subsequent license holder at the same place of business unless the subsequent license holder provides the commissioner with adequate documentation demonstrating that the subsequent license holder acquired the premises
    or business through an arm&#39;s length transaction and that the sale or lease was not conducted, in whole or in part, for the purpose of permitting the original licensee to avoid the effect of violations on the premises. 5. For purposes of paragraphs
    3 and 4 of <a href='//sections/20-202.html'>section 20-202</a>, &quot;arm&#39;s length transaction&quot; means a sale of a fee or all undivided interests in real property, or lease of any part thereof, or a sale of a business, in good faith and for valuable consideration, that reflects the fair market
    value of such real property or lease, or business, in the open market, between two informed and willing parties, where neither is under any compulsion to participate in the transaction, unaffected by any unusual conditions indicating a reasonable
    possibility that the sale or lease was made for the purpose of permitting the original licensee to avoid the effect of violations on the premises. The following sales or leases shall be presumed not to be arm&#39;s length transactions unless adequate
    documentation is provided demonstrating that the sale or lease was not conducted, in whole or in part, for the purpose of permitting the original licensee to avoid the effect of violations on the premises: (1) a sale between relatives; or (2) a sale
    between related companies or partners in a business; or (3) a sale or lease affected by other facts or circumstances that would indicate that the sale or lease is entered into for the primary purpose of permitting the original licensee to avoid the
    effect of violations on the premises, or revocation of a license. * NB Effective until May 18, 2014 * d. Issuance of license. 1. A license shall be issued to a person to conduct the business of a retail dealer for each place of business where such
