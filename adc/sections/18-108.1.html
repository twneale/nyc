For the purposes of this section, the following terms shall have the following meanings: (1) &quot;All terrain vehicle&quot; or &quot;ATV&quot; shall mean any self-propelled vehicle which is manufactured for sale for operation primarily
    on off-highway trails or in off-highway competitions and only incidentally operated on public highways provided that such vehicle does not exceed sixty inches in width, or eight hundred pounds dry weight. This definition shall not include a &quot;snowmobile&quot;
    or other self-propelled vehicles manufactured for off-highway use which utilize an endless belt tread. (2) &quot;Authorized emergency vehicle&quot; shall mean every ambulance, police vehicle or bicycle, correction vehicle, fire vehicle, civil defense emergency
    vehicle, emergency ambulance service vehicle, environmental emergency response vehicle, sanitation patrol vehicle, hazardous materials emergency vehicle and ordnance disposal vehicle of the armed forces of the United States. (3) &quot;Beach&quot; shall mean
    land along the shores of an ocean, bay, estuary, inlet or river of New York City landward from the mean low water line extending contiguously to the place where there is a distinct difference in topography which may be demarcated by the furthest of
    either (i) a vegetation line; (ii) an artifically-made feature generally parallel to the ocean, bay, estuary, inlet or river, such as, but not limited to, a retaining structure, seawall, bulkhead, parking area or road, except that land that extends
    under an elevated boardwalk is considered to be a part of the beach; or (iii) the landward toe of the dune, which is furthest from the ocean, bay, estuary, inlet or river and twenty-five feet landward from that point. (4) &quot;Dune&quot; shall mean a natural
    or artifically-made ridge or hill of vegetated or drifting windblown soil, the principal component of which is sand, that lies generally parallel to and landward of the shore. However, a dune shall not mean a small mound of loose, windblown sand found
    on a park, road or structure. (5) &quot;Motor vehicle&quot; shall mean any vehicle designed to be operated or driven upon a public highway which is propelled by any power other than muscular power, except (i) electrically-driven mobility devices operated or

    other than a lien holder, having the property in or title to a vehicle or vessel. The term includes a person entitled to the use and possession of a vehicle or vessel subject to a security interest in another person and also includes any lessee or
    bailee of a motor vehicle or vessel having the exclusive use thereof, under a lease or otherwise, for a period greater than thirty days. (8) &quot;Operator&quot; shall mean any person who uses a motorcycle, all terrain vehicle, snowmobile or motor vehicle.
    (9) &quot;Snowmobile&quot; shall mean any self-propelled vehicle designed for travel on snow or ice, steered by skis or runners and supported in whole or in part by one or more skis, belts or cleats. (10) &quot;Toe&quot; shall mean the lowest point on a slope of a dune.
    b. No unauthorized person may operate any motorcycle, all terrain vehicle, snowmobile or motor vehicle on a beach under the jurisdiction of the commissioner. An authorized person shall include (1) a person operating a motorcycle, an all terrain vehicle,
    a snowmobile or a motor vehicle in accordance with a permit issued pursuant to subdivision (g) of this section; and (2) a department employee engaged in the proper and authorized performance of his or her assigned duties, a member of the police department,
    or an operator of an authorized emergency vehicle engaged in the proper and authorized performance of his or her assigned duties. c. (1) A person who violates subdivision (b) of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by not more
    than ninety days imprisonment or by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars or by both such fine and imprisonment. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph nine of subdivision (a) of section five hundred thirty-three of the New York city charter,
    such person shall also be liable for a civil penalty of not less than five hundred dollars nor more than one thousand dollars which may be recovered in a proceeding before the environmental control board. (2) Where the operator is less than fourteen
    years of age, a notice of violation of this section shall be personally served upon such operator&#39;s parent or guardian in accordance with the civil practice law and rules. Where the operator is fourteen years of age or over, but less than eighteen
    years of age, a notice of violation of this section shall be personally served upon such operator and his or her parent or guardian in accordance with the civil practice law and rules. (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other local law, where
    a summons or a notice of violation is issued for a violation of subdivision (b), an authorized designee of the commissioner or a member of the police department may seize and impound the motorcycle, all terrain vehicle, snowmobile or motor vehicle.
    d. A motorcycle, all terrain vehicle, snowmobile or motor vehicle seized and impounded pursuant to this section shall be released to the owner or other person lawfully entitled to possession upon payment of the costs of removal and storage as set
    forth in the rules of the department and proof of payment of any fine or civil penalty imposed for the violation or, if a proceeding in connection with the violation is pending before a court or the environmental control board, upon the posting of
    a bond or other form of security acceptable to the department in an amount which will secure the payment of such costs and any fine or civil penalty which may be imposed for the violation. If a court or the environmental control board finds in favor
    of the respondent, the owner shall be entitled forthwith to possession of the motorcycle, all terrain vehicle, snowmobile or motor vehicle without charge and to the extent that any amount has been previously paid for release of the motorcycle, all
    terrain vehicle, snowmobile or motor vehicle, such amount shall be refunded. e. The owner of a motorcycle, all terrain vehicle, snowmobile or motor vehicle shall be given the opportunity for a post seizure hearing within five business days before
    the environmental control board regarding the seizure. The environmental control board shall render a determination within three business days after the conclusion of the hearing. Where the environmental control board finds that there was no basis
    for the seizure, the owner shall be entitled forthwith to possession of the motorcycle, all terrain vehicle, snowmobile or motor vehicle without charge and to the extent that any amount has been previously paid for release of the motorcycle, all terrain
    vehicle, snowmobile or motor vehicle, such amount shall be refunded. f. Upon the seizure of a motorcycle, all terrain vehicle, snowmobile or motor vehicle pursuant to this section, the operator shall be given written notice of the procedure for redemption
    of the motorcycle, all terrain vehicle, snowmobile or motor vehicle and the procedure for requesting a post seizure hearing. Where the operator is not the owner thereof, such notice provided to the operator shall be deemed to be notice to the owner.
    Where the motorcycle, all terrain vehicle, snowmobile or motor vehicle is registered pursuant to the vehicle and traffic law, such notice shall also be mailed to the registered owner. Where the operator is less than eighteen years old, such notice
    shall also be either personally served upon the operator&#39;s parent or guardian or mailed to the operator&#39;s parent or guardian if the name and address of such person is reasonably ascertainable. g. The commissioner shall have the right to issue a permit
    to operate a motorcycle, all terrain vehicle, snowmobile or motor vehicle upon any beach for a special purpose, including but not limited to, the recording or filming of audio, video or other electronic media. h. The provisions of this section shall
    be enforced by an authorized designee of the commissioner or by a member of the police department. i. The commissioner, in consultation with the police commissioner, shall promulgate such rules as are necessary, (1) to set forth the procedures which
    must be followed regarding the seizure and release of any motorcycle, all terrain vehicle, snowmobile or motor vehicle pursuant to subdivision (c) of this section; (2) to establish the time within which a motorcycle, all terrain vehicle, snowmobile
    or motor vehicle which is not redeemed shall be deemed abandoned, and the procedures for subsequent disposal; and (3) to provide for reasonable fees for the transportation and storage of such vehicles.</span>
