                    <span class="" style=""><a href='//sections/27-705.html'>§ 27-705</a> Procedures. (a) Continuous Driving. Driving of piles preliminary to final seating shall be continuous for an interval adequate to break or prevent the development of freeze. The hammer shall be operated at its rated speed during this interval.
    (b) Jetting. Jetting, augering and other methods of pre-excavation shall not be used unless permitted in writing by the architect or engineer. When permitted, such procedures shall be carried out in a manner which will not impair the carrying capacity
    of the piles already in place or the safety of existing adjacent structures. Jetting or augering shall be stopped at least three feet above the final expected pile-tip elevation and at least three feet above the tip elevation of any pile previously
    driven within six feet of the jet or auger, except that where piles are to be end bearing on rock or hardpan, jetting or augering may be carried to the surface of the rock or hardpan. Piles shall be carried down beyond the depth of jetting, augering
    or other pre-excavation until the required resistance is obtained. If there is evidence that jetting or other procedures have disturbed the load-bearing capacities of previously installed piles, those piles that have been disturbed shall be restored
    to conditions meeting the requirements of this article by redriving or by other methods acceptable to the architect or engineer. Redriving or other remedial measures shall be instituted after the jetting or other operations in the area have been completed.
    (c) Sequence of installation. Individual piles and pile groups shall be installed in such sequence that: (1) the carrying capacity of previously installed piles is not reduced; (2) the soil surrounding the piles is not compacted to the extent that
    other piles in the group cannot be installed properly; and (3) ground movement that would damage adjacent buildings or utilities is prevented. In general, in any group, driving shall start from one side and proceed progressively toward the other side
    of the group or shall start from the middle and proceed toward the edges of the group. (d) Heaved piles. In soils in which the installation of piles causes previously installed piles to heave, accurate level marks shall be put on all piles immediately
    after installation, and all piles that have been heaved by an amount in excess of one-quarter of an inch shall be redriven to the required resistance. (e) Penetration measurements. Penetration measurements made for the purpose of determining resistance
    to driving shall not be made when pile heads are damaged to an extent that may affect measured penetration, nor shall they be made immediately after fresh cushion blocks have been inserted under the striking part of the hammer.</span>
