As used in this section: 1. The term &quot;private sewer or drain&quot; shall mean any private sewer or drain
    located in public property or in any public or private street or streets and emptying into the public sewer system, but shall not include a curb-to-sewer connection as defined in <a href='//sections/24-512.html'>section 24-512</a> of the code or a house sewer connection. 2. The term
    &quot;private street&quot; shall mean a privately owned street in which the public has a right of user not subject to revocation by the owner thereof. b. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, it shall be the duty of the department of environmental protection
    to control, maintain, supervise and repair, and to inspect periodically, private sewers or drains as defined in subdivision a hereof, provided, however, that the department shall have no obligation or duty to replace or reconstruct any such sewer
    or drain. The cost of such control, maintenance, supervision, repair and inspection shall be borne by the city, within the amounts duly appropriated therefor. c. Right of entry. 1. The commissioner of environmental protection, his or her deputies
    and any other officers and employees of the department of environmental protection, when authorized by such commissioner, may enter upon public or private property and bring in necessary equipment at reasonable hours, for the purpose of exercising
    the powers or performing the duties of the department under this section. Refusal to permit such entry or equipment shall be punishable as provided in <a href='//sections/24-524.html'>section 24-524</a> of this chapter. 2. The owner of any parcel of real property connected to the public
    sewer system, as a condition precedent to the continuance of such connection, and the owner of any parcel of real property who makes application or causes an application to be made on his or her behalf for connection with the public sewer system,
    as a condition precedent to the granting of permission for such connection, shall be deemed to have consented and agreed that the commissioner of environmental protection and his or her deputies and such other officers or employees of the department
    of environmental protection as are authorized by such commissioner may, without fee or hindrance, enter the premises connected with the sewer system, or any part thereof and bring in any necessary equipment at proper or reasonable hours for the purpose
    of exercising the powers and duties of such department prescribed by this section.</span>
