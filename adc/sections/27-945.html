                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/nyc/adc/sections/27-945.html'>§ 27-945</a> Water supply for standpipe systems. (a) Primary water supply for standpipe systems. Every standpipe system except nonautomatic dry standpipe systems shall have a primary water supply available at all times at every hose outlet, or made available
    automatically when the hose valve at any outlet is opened. Such primary water supply may be from one or more gravity tanks from a pressure tank or tanks, from a direct connection to a city water main, from a connection to a private water main, or
    from an automatic fire pump. (b) Method of providing water supply for standpipe systems. Combinations of two or more of the following methods shall be used; in using such combinations, the siamese connections shall be considered as a source of supply.
    (1) Direct connections of standpipes to the city water system provided one of the following conditions is met: a. A statement furnished by the bureau of water supply of the department of environmental protection indicates a pressure in the street
    main that is capable of maintaining a static pressure of at least fifteen psig. at the highest hose outlet between the hours of eight a. m. and five p. m. on a normal working day when a street level fire hydrant within two hundred fifty feet of the
    building is supplied from the same street main and is discharging at least five hundred gpm through a two and one-half inch hydrant butt. b. For buildings forty feet or less in height with an area of not more than twenty thousand square feet per floor,
    there is a four inch direct connection to the street main that is fed two ways or there is a four inch direct connection to each of two street mains on two street fronts so installed that shutting off one service will not interfere with the supply
    of the other, and there is sufficient pressure in the street main to maintain a minimum static pressure of twenty-five psig. at the highest required hose outlet and the department of environmental protection states that the required street pressure
    is available. (2) A private yard main when meeting the conditions of a direct water connection to the city water system. (3) Gravity tanks provided: a. The minimum quantity of water reserved for standpipe service is thirty-five hundred gallons in
    each standpipe zone. b. The bottom of the tank shall be at least twenty-five feet above the highest hose outlet that such tank supplies, (except the roof manifold) and those hose outlets in a penthouse enclosing mechanical equipment, except as otherwise
    provided in subparagraph e of this paragraph. c. Each zone of the standpipe system having three risers or more shall have a total fire reserve capacity of five thousand gallons or more from one or more gravity tanks for each zone. d. Where a group
    of two or more buildings, connected or separated, is operated under a single control, a single gravity tank having a fire reserve capacity of at least five thousand gallons may be accepted as the primary water supply for the several standpipe systems
    of such group, provided a dead riser is carried from the bottom of the tank to an underground header or cross connection system and provided each building unit has a post indicator type control valve outside or an o.s. and y. control valve inside
    the building at a readily accessible location. The underground cross connection may not cross any public street without the approval of the city departments having jurisdiction. e. Useable storage or office space on penthouse floors shall be provided
    with a riser outlet valve within the distances stated in <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/27-935.html'>section 27-935</a> of this article. In lieu of elevating the bottom of the gravity tank twenty-five feet above these outlets, an automatic fire pump with local supervisory alarms may be installed.
    The pump shall be capable of delivering two hundred fifty gpm. at a pressure of twenty-five psig. above the normal static pressure at the highest outlet supplied by the pump. The pump shall take suction from the gravity tank and be so arranged as
    to permit the siamese connection and any required manual fire pump to supply these outlets. No more than three stories of any penthouse or of penthouse and building stories combined, may be supplied by this method. (4) Pressure tanks shall be acceptable
    as the primary supply to the system provided all of the following conditions are met: a. A pressure tank, or tanks, so proportioned and located that a pressure of at least fifteen psig will be available at the nozzle of the highest required hose station,
    exclusive of roof outlets, when all the water has been discharged from the pressure tank. b. The storage quantities stated for gravity tanks in subparagraphs a, c and d of paragraph three of this subdivision are met and an additional volume equivalent
    to one-half of the required water storage space is provided for the required air. c. An air compressor is provided with suitable automatic control and of sufficient capacity to build up air pressure of at least seventy-five psig. in the tank within
    three hours and to maintain thereafter an air pressure between seventy and eighty psig. The automatic control shall also maintain the proper air-to-water ratio in the pressure tank. d. Pressure tanks shall be supplied with water through a fixed pipe,
    independent of the standpipe riser, and at least two inches in size. The water supply and connection shall be capable of supplying the tank at a rate of at least sixty-five gpm without reducing the pressure in the tank. The tank shall have a fixed
    water level plate on the end opposite the gauge glass, or other equivalent indicating device. (5) An automatic fire pump shall be acceptable as the primary supply to the system provided: a. The building is three hundred feet high or less, or if the
    building is higher than three hundred feet, the automatic fire pump is used only for the lower three hundred feet. The zones above three hundred feet shall be supplied by either a gravity tank conforming to paragraph three of subdivision (b) of this
    section or a pressure tank conforming to paragraph four of subdivision (b) of this section and in addition shall be supplied by the manual fire pump required by <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/27-946.html'>section 27-946</a> of this article. b. The automatic fire pump supplying the system or section
    has a capacity of at least five hundred gpm with a discharge pressure of at least twenty-five but not exceeding seventy psig (above the normal) static pressure at the highest hose outlet within the zone supplied by the pump plus the frictional resistance
    from the pump to the outlet at a flow of five hundred gpm. c. The electrical power to the pump is connected to the street side of the building service switch. (c) High and low risers and cross connections in standpipe systems. When tanks are used
    for the primary water supply, the standpipe systems may use separate riser systems serving, respectively, low and high parts of the building. Separate gravity tanks or pressure tanks may supply each zone, but in every case the standpipe system shall
    be so designed that every hose outlet of the entire system can be supplied through the required cross connections from every siamese connection and from every manually operated fire pump located at or below the street level. (d) Use of standpipe riser
    for sprinkler system water supply. Standpipe risers may be used to supply water to sprinklers in buildings classified in occupancy group E, one hundred feet or more in height, and in existing office buildings, one hundred feet or more in height, in
    accordance with applicable provisions of this subchapter and reference standards RS17-1 and RS17-2.</span>
