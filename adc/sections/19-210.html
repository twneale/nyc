Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the parking violations bureau is hereby authorized and empowered to establish a demonstration program
    imposing monetary liability on the owner of a vehicle for failure of an operator thereof to comply with traffic-control indications in accordance with the provisions of this section. The department of transportation, for purposes of implementation
    of such program, shall be authorized to install and operate traffic-control signal photo violation-monitoring devices at no more than one hundred fifty intersections at any one time. 2. Such demonstration program shall utilize necessary technologies
    to ensure, to the extent practicable, that photographs produced by such traffic-control signal photo violation-monitoring systems shall not include images that identify the driver, the passengers, or the contents of the vehicle. Provided, however,
    that no notice of liability issued pursuant to this section shall be dismissed solely because a photograph or photographs allow for the identification of the contents of a vehicle, provided that such city has made a reasonable effort to comply with
    the provisions of this paragraph. (b) 1. The owner of a vehicle shall be liable for a penalty imposed pursuant to this section if such vehicle was used or operated with the permission of the owner, express or implied, in violation of subdivision (d)
    of section eleven hundred eleven of the vehicle and traffic law, and such violation is evidenced by information obtained from a traffic-control signal photo violation-monitoring system; provided, however, that no owner of a vehicle shall be liable
    for a penalty imposed pursuant to this section where the operator of such vehicle has been convicted of the underlying violation of subdivision (d) of section eleven hundred eleven of the vehicle and traffic law. 2. Notwithstanding any other provision
    of this section, no owner of a vehicle shall be subject to a monetary fine imposed pursuant to this section if the operator of such vehicle was operating such vehicle without the consent of the owner at the time such operator failed to obey a traffic-control
    indication. For purposes of this subdivision, there shall be a presumption that the operator of such vehicle was operating such vehicle with the consent of the owner at the time such operator failed to obey a traffic-control indication. (c) For purposes
    of this section, &quot;owner&quot; shall mean any person, corporation, partnership, firm, agency, association, lessor, or organization who at the time of the issuance of a notice of violation in which a vehicle is operated: (1) is the beneficial or equitable
    owner of such vehicle; or (2) has title to such vehicle; or (3) is the registrant or co-registrant of such vehicle which is registered with the department of motor vehicles of this state or any other state, territory, district, province nation or
    other jurisdiction; or (4) uses such vehicle in its vehicle renting and/or leasing business; or (5) is an owner of such vehicle as defined by section one hundred twenty-eight or subdivision (a) of section twenty-one hundred one of the vehicle and
    traffic law. (d) For purposes of this section, &quot;traffic-control signal photo violation-monitoring system&quot; shall mean a device installed to work in conjunction with a traffic-control signal which, during operation, automatically produces two or more
    photographs, two or more microphotographs, a videotape or other recorded images of each vehicle at the time it is used or operated in violation of subdivision (d) of section eleven hundred eleven of the vehicle and traffic law. (e) A certificate,
    sworn to or affirmed by a technician employed by the department, or a facsimile thereof, based upon inspection of photographs, microphotographs, videotape or other recorded images produced by a traffic-control signal photo violation-monitoring system,
    shall be prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein. Any photographs, microphotographs, videotape or other recorded images evidencing such a violation shall be available for inspection in any proceeding to adjudicate the liability for such
    violation imposed pursuant to this section. (f) An owner liable for a violation of subdivision (d) of section eleven hundred eleven of the vehicle and traffic law pursuant to this section shall be liable for monetary penalties in accordance with a
    schedule of fines and penalties to be promulgated by such bureau. The liability of the owner pursuant to this section shall not exceed fifty dollars for each violation; provided however that such bureau may provide for an additional penalty not in
    excess of twenty-five dollars for each violation for the failure to respond to a notice of liability within the prescribed time period. Such bureau shall adjudicate liability imposed by this section. (g) An imposition of liability under this section
    shall not be deemed a conviction as an operator and shall not be made part of the operating record of the person upon whom such liability is imposed nor shall it be used for insurance purposes in the provision of motor vehicle insurance coverage.
    (h) 1. A notice of liability shall be sent by first class mail to each person alleged to be liable as an owner for a violation of subdivision (d) of section eleven hundred eleven of the vehicle and traffic law pursuant to this section. Personal service
    on the owner shall not be required. A manual or automatic record of mailing prepared in the ordinary course of business shall be prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein. 2. A notice of liability shall contain the name and address of the
    person alleged to be liable as an owner for a violation of subdivision (d) of section eleven hundred eleven of the vehicle and traffic law pursuant to this section, the registration number of the vehicle involved in such violation, the location where
    such violation took place, the date and time of such violation and the identification number of the camera which recorded the violation or other document locator number. 3. The notice of liability shall contain information advising the person charged
    of the manner and the time in which he or she may contest the liability alleged in the notice. Such notice of liability shall also contain a warning to advise the persons charged that failure to contest in the manner and time provided shall be deemed
    an admission of liability and that a default judgment may be entered thereon. 4. The notice of liability shall be prepared and mailed by the bureau or its designee. (i) If an owner receives a notice of liability pursuant to this section for any time
    period during which the vehicle was reported to the police department as having been stolen, it shall be a valid defense to an allegation of liability for a violation of subdivision (d) of section eleven hundred eleven of the vehicle and traffic law
    pursuant to this section that the vehicle had been reported to the police as stolen prior to the time the violation occurred and had not be recovered by such time. For purposes of asserting the defense provided by this subdivision it shall be sufficient
    that a certified copy of the police report on the stolen vehicle be sent by first class mail, return receipt requested, to such bureau. (j) If the owner liable for a violation of subdivision (d) of section eleven hundred eleven of the vehicle and
    traffic law pursuant to this section was not the operator of the vehicle at the time of the violation, the owner may maintain an action for indemnification against the operator. (k) An appeal of an adjudication of liability pursuant to this section
    may be taken in accordance with the provisions of <a href='//sections/19-208.html'>section 19-208</a>. (l) 1. An owner who is a lessor of a vehicle to which a notice of liability was issued pursuant to subdivision (h) of this section shall not be liable for the violation of subdivision
    (d) of section eleven hundred eleven of the vehicle and traffic law provided that: A. prior to the violation of the lessor has filed with the bureau and paid the required filing fee in accordance with the provisions of section two hundred thirty-nine
    of the vehicle and traffic law; and B. within thirty-seven days after receiving notice from the bureau of the date and time of a liability, together with the other information contained in the original notice of liability, the lessor submits to the
    bureau the correct name and address of the lessee of the vehicle indentified in the notice of liability at the time of such violation, together with such other additional information contained in the rental lease or other contract document, as may
    be reasonably required by the bureau pursuant to regulations that may be promulgated for such purpose. 2. Failure to comply with subparagraph B or paragraph one of this subdivision shall render the owner liable for the penalty prescribed in this section.
    3. Where the lessor complies with the provisions of this subdivision, the lessee of such vehicle on the date of such violation shall be deemed to be the owner of such vehicle for purposes of this section, shall be subject to liability for such violation
    pursuant to this section and shall be sent a notice of liability pursuant to subdivision (h) of this section. (m) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the liability of an operator of a vehicle for any violation of subdivision (d) of
    section eleven hundred eleven of the vehicle and traffic law. (n) On or before September 1, 1989, and every four months thereafter, until such time as the demonstration program authorized in subdivision (a) hereof shall be fully operational, the commissioner
    of transportation shall submit a written report to the council on the status of said demonstration program. Such report shall include, but not be limited to, the locations selected for inclusion in the demonstration program and the cost to the city,
    both individually and collectively, of each location included in such demonstration project. (o) The commissioner shall submit to the governor, the temporary president of the senate, the speaker of the assembly and the council an annual report on
    the results of the use of a traffic-control signal photo violation-monitoring system on or before June first, two thousand seven and on the same date in each succeeding year in which the demonstration program is operable. Such report shall include,
    but not be limited to: 1. a description of the locations where traffic-control signal photo violation-monitoring systems were used; 2. within each borough of such city, the aggregate number, type and severity of accidents reported at intersections
    where a traffic-control signal photo violation-monitoring system is used for the year preceding the installation of such system, to the extent the information is maintained by the department of motor vehicles of this state; 3. within each borough
    of such city, the aggregate number, type and severity of accidents reported at intersections where a traffic-control signal photo violation-monitoring system is used, to the extent the information is maintained by the department of motor vehicles
    of this state; 4. the number of violations recorded at each intersection where a traffic-control signal photo violation-monitoring system is used and in the aggregate on a daily, weekly and monthly basis; 5. the total number of notices of liability
    issued for violations recorded by such systems; 6. the number of fines and total amount of fines paid after first notice of liability issued for violations recorded by such systems; 7. the number of violations adjudicated and results of such adjudications
    including breakdowns of dispositions made for violations recorded by such systems; 8. the total amount of revenue realized by such city from such adjudications; 9. expenses incurred by such city in connection with the program; and 10. quality of the
    adjudication process and its results. (p) It shall be a defense to any prosecution for a violation of subdivision (d) of section eleven hundred eleven of the vehicle and traffic law pursuant to this section that such traffic-control indications were
    malfunctioning at the time of the alleged violation. * NB Expires December 1, 2014</span>
