Subject to the provisions of subdivision b of this section, upon retirement for service an original plan member not subject to article eleven (as defined in subdivision four-c
    of <a href='//sections/13-313.html'>section 13-313</a> of this subchapter) shall receive a retirement allowance which shall be equal to one-half his or her final compensation plus, for each year he or she shall have served in the uniformed force of the fire department after having attained
    the minimum period of service retirement elected by him or her, the additional amount provided for by section two hundred seven-b of the general municipal law with respect to such year. b. In addition to the benefits provided for in subdivision a
    of this section, an original plan member not subject to article eleven, upon retirement for service, shall receive, for each year, or fraction thereof, of service credit transferred from the New York city employees&#39; retirement system, a retirement
    allowance of fifty-five percent of one-sixtieth of his or her five-year-average-salary (as defined in subdivision twenty-eight of <a href='//sections/13-313.html'>section 13-313</a> of this subchapter) if such service credit was for service rendered prior to October first, nineteen hundred
    fifty-one or seventy-five percent of one-sixtieth of his or her five-year-average-salary if such service was rendered on or after October first, nineteen hundred fifty-one. Nothing contained in this subdivision b shall be construed as denying or impairing

    eligible for membership in the New York city employees&#39; retirement system. c. Upon retirement for service, an original plan member subject to article eleven (as defined in subdivision four-d of <a href='//sections/13-313.html'>section 13-313</a> of this subchapter) shall receive a retirement
