    the minimum period of service retirement elected by him or her, the additional amount provided for by section two hundred seven-b of the general municipal law with respect to such year. b. In addition to the benefits provided for in subdivision a
    of this section, an original plan member not subject to article eleven, upon retirement for service, shall receive, for each year, or fraction thereof, of service credit transferred from the New York city employees&#39; retirement system, a retirement
