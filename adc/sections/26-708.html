Except as otherwise provided in subdivision b of this section, any person who knowingly violates or assists in the violation of any section of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon

    chapter shall be subject to a civil penalty of one hundred dollars per day per unit for each day that a building is not in compliance with the provisions of such sections; provided, however, that such civil penalty shall not exceed one thousand dollars
    per unit. b. Any person who knowingly violates or assists in the violation of <a href='/adc/sections/26-703.html'>section 26-703</a> of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine not more than two times the amount required to be
    reserved by <a href='/adc/sections/26-703.html'>section 26-703</a> of this chapter which was not so reserved. Any person who violates or assists in the violation of <a href='/adc/sections/26-703.html'>section 26-703</a> of this chapter shall also be subject to a civil penalty of one thousand dollars per day for each day that
    the reserve fund required by <a href='/adc/sections/26-703.html'>section 26-703</a> of this chapter is not established; provided, however, that such civil penalty shall not exceed the amount required to be reserved pursuant to <a href='/adc/sections/26-703.html'>section 26-703</a> of this chapter. c. In addition, any other action

    this chapter, or for such other relief as may be appropriate, until the hearing and determination of such action or proceeding and the entry of final judgment or order therein. The court, or judge or justice thereof, to whom such application is made,
    is hereby authorized forthwith to make any or all of the orders above specified, as may be required in such application, with or without notice, and to make such other or further orders or directions as may be necessary to render the same effectual.
