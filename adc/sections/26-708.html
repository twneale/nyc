    per unit. b. Any person who knowingly violates or assists in the violation of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/26-703.html'>section 26-703</a> of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine not more than two times the amount required to be

Any person who violates or assists in the violation of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/26-703.html'>section 26-703</a> of this chapter shall also be subject to a civil penalty of one thousand dollars per day for each day that
