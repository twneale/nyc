Except in accordance with proper judicial order or as otherwise provided by law, it shall be unlawful for the commissioner of finance, the chairperson of the taxi and limousine commission, the tax appeals tribunal
    or any officer or employee of the department of finance or taxi and limousine commission or the tax appeals tribunal, to divulge or make known in any manner any information contained in or relating to any return provided for by this chapter. The officers
    charged with the custody of such returns shall not be required to produce any of them or evidence of anything contained in them in any action or proceeding in any court, except on behalf of the commissioner of finance in an action or proceeding under
    the provisions of this chapter, or on behalf of any party to an action or proceeding under the provisions of this chapter when the returns or facts shown thereby are directly involved in such action or proceeding, in either of which events the court
    may require the production of, and may admit in evidence, so much of said returns or of the facts shown thereby, as are pertinent to the action or proceeding and no more. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the delivery to a transferee or
    transferor or to the duly authorized representative of either of them of a certified copy of any return filed in connection with the tax imposed by this chapter; nor to prohibit the delivery of such a certified copy of such return or of any information
    contained in or relating thereto to the United States of America or any department thereof, the state of New York or any department thereof, the city of New York or any department thereof provided the same is required for official business; nor to
    prohibit the inspection for official business of such returns by the chairperson of the taxi and limousine commission, the corporation counsel or other legal representatives of the city or by the district attorney of any county within the city; nor
    to prohibit the publication of statistics so classified as to prevent the identification of particular returns or items thereof. b. (1) Any officer or employee of the city who willfully violates the provisions of subdivision a of this section shall
    be dismissed from office and be incapable of holding any public office in this city for a period of five years thereafter. (2) Cross-reference: For criminal penalties, see chapter forty of this title. c. This section shall be deemed a state statute
    for purposes of paragraph (a) of subdivision two of section eighty-seven of the public officers law. d. Notwithstanding anything in subdivision a of this section to the contrary, if a taxpayer has petitioned the tax appeals tribunal for administrative
    review as provided in section one hundred seventy of the charter, the commissioner of finance shall be authorized to present to the tribunal any report or return of such taxpayer, or any information contained therein or relating thereto, which may
    be material or relevant to the proceeding before the tribunal. The tax appeals tribunal shall be authorized to publish a copy or a summary of any decision rendered pursuant to section one hundred seventy-one of the charter.</span>
