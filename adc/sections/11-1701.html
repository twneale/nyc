    income for the taxable year over one hundred fifty thousand dollars and the denominator is fifty thousand dollars. (C) This paragraph shall only apply to taxable years beginning after two thousand two and before two thousand six. (2) Resident married
    individuals filing joint returns, surviving spouses, resident heads of households, resident unmarried individuals, resident married individuals filing separate returns and resident estates and trusts. (A) The tax table benefit is the difference between
    (i) the amount of taxable income set forth in the tax table in subdivision (g) of this section not subject to the highest rate of tax for the taxable year multiplied by such rate and (ii) the highest dollar denominated tax for such amount of taxable
    income set forth in the tax table applicable to the taxable year in subdivision (g) of this section less the sum of the tax table benefits in paragraph one of this subdivision. (B) For such taxpayers with adjusted gross income over five hundred thousand
