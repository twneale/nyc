                    <span class="" style=""><a href='//sections/27-973.html'>§ 27-973</a> Location and identification of sending stations and sounding devices. (a) Location of sending stations. (1) There shall be at least one fire alarm sending station in each story of any building at all natural paths of egress to the street. The
    station shall be installed at a readily accessible location meeting the approval of the fire commissioner. The sending station shall be kept unobstructed at all times. Additional sending stations shall be installed so that no point on any floor is
    more than one hundred fifty feet from the nearest sending station in buildings of Group I construction and one hundred feet in buildings of Group II construction. (2) All fire alarm stations installed or relocated after April first, nineteen hundred
    eighty-four shall be installed so that the handle is approximately four feet from the floor. (b) Location of sounding devices. (1) Sounding devices shall be of sufficient number so that the alarm shall be clearly audible to all the occupants of the
    building. (2) The centerline of all gongs and signaling devices shall be located at least eight feet above the floor except that in locations where ceilings prevent the installation at this height, the centerline of the device shall be located six
    inches below the ceiling. (3) Approved gongs shall be provided as the sounding devices. Where gongs are not audible, approved horns, chimes, or whistles may be installed subject to the approval of the fire commissioner. (c) Location of instructions.
    An approved instruction card, properly marked and framed under glass, shall be installed at each fire alarm station. Instruction cards for individually coded systems shall indicate the code designation and location of each sending station in the building.
    (d) Fastening for devices. All materials and devices used in fire alarm signal systems shall be securely fastened in position. The locations shall be selected by an architect or engineer, subject to the approval of the commissioner. (e) Identification
    of equipment. Fire alarm sending stations for all systems shall be painted red. A diagonal white stripe one inch wide from upper left hand corner to lower right hand corner shall be painted or applied to sending stations which transmit a fire alarm
    signal to the fire department via a central station of a franchised operating company. The stripe shall not render any lettering illegible or obliterate the station number. (f) Mixed occupancy buildings. Where a building is subdivided by fire divisions,
    each building section may be treated as a separate building for the purpose of fire alarm signal system installations. One control board may be used, if so arranged as to operate the signaling devices in each building section independently. (g) Subdivided
    occupancy. In buildings requiring fire alarm signal systems, and in which parts are occupied by other than factory tenants and in which the fire department has approved the use of a local fire brigade, the commissioner may accept dual operation systems.</span>
