                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/nyc/adc/sections/18-125.html'>§ 18-125</a> Thomas Pell Wildlife Refuge and Sanctuary. The commissioner shall set aside as a haven and preserve for wildlife, four sections of park lands in the northwestern portion of Pelham Bay Park designated on the official maps of the department as
    proposed sanitation landfill areas II, III, IV and VI, broadly described as follows: 1. Area II, an irregularly-shaped parcel bounded on the north and northeast by the Hutchinson river parkway and Rock uplands, on the east by the Split Rock golf course,
    on the south by the New York, New Haven and Hartford railroad tracks and on the west by Bartow road, and running through the center thereof, a substantial portion of Goose creek. 2. Area III, an irregularly-shaped parcel bounded on the north by an
    area of land south of the Hutchinson parkway and the Bartow road exit from said parkway, on the east by a land area west of Bartow road, on the south by the tracks of the New York, New Haven and Hartford railroad tracks and on the west by the center
    line of the Hutchinson river, but to include Goose island. 3. Area IV, an irregularly-shaped parcel of land bounded on the north by the New England thruway, on the east by the Hutchinson parkway, and on the south and on the west by the center line
    of the Hutchinson river. 4. Area VI an irregularly-shaped parcel of land bounded on the north and west by the Hutchinson river, on the east and south by Shore road, said land being known as Tallapoosa west. Excluding, however, Tallapoosa east in said
    park lands which has been designated as a landfill area for use by the department of sanitation. The commissioner may enter into an agreement with a nonprofit organization for the operation and maintenance by such organization of the areas hereinabove
    referred to for the adequate keeping, maintenance, management, operation and preservation by such organization of the animals, aquatic animals, migratory and resident fowl and songbirds, fish and other flora and fauna indigenous to the area, to establish
    collections of specimens and provide interested nature lovers and educational institutions with opportunities for study and research in the areas. Upon the making of such agreement, the city may annually, in its discretion, appropriate to the operating
    organization such sum or sums as it may determine for the maintenance and support of the Thomas Pell Wildlife Refuge and Sanctuary and the activities of the operating organization in connection therewith. The failure of the commissioner to enter into
    such an agreement shall in no way alter the status of the above-described areas as wildlife sanctuaries.</span>
