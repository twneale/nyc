                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-1751.html'>§ 11-1751</a> Returns and liabilities. (a) General. On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the close of a taxable year, an income tax return under this chapter shall be made and filed by or for every city resident individual, estate
    or trust required to file a New York state personal income tax (including a minimum income tax and separate tax on the ordinary income portion of lump sum distributions) return for the taxable year. (b) Husband and wife. (1) If the New York state
    personal income tax liability of husband and wife is determined on a separate return, their city personal income tax liabilities and returns shall be separate. (2) If the New York state personal income tax liabilities of husband and wife (other than
    a husband and wife described in paragraph three) are determined on a joint return, they shall file a joint city personal income tax return, and their tax liabilities shall be joint and several except as provided in paragraph five of this subdivision,
    <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-1755.html'>section 11-1755</a> of this chapter and subsection (e) of section six hundred eighty-five of the tax law. (3) If either husband or wife is a city resident and the other is a city nonresident, and their New York state personal income tax liabilities are
    determined on a joint return: (A) they may elect to file a joint city personal income tax return as if both were residents, in which case their city personal income tax liabilities shall be joint and several except as provided in paragraph five of
    this subdivision, <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-1755.html'>section 11-1755</a> of this chapter and subsection (e) of section six hundred eighty-five of the tax law, or (B) the resident spouse may elect to file a separate city personal income tax return, in which case his city personal income
    tax liability shall be determined as if he were filing a separate New York state personal income tax return. (5) If a joint return has been made under this subdivision for a taxable year and only one spouse is liable for past-due support, or a past-due
    legally enforceable debt, or a city of New York tax warrant judgment debt, or an amount of a default in repayment of a guaranteed student, state university or city university loan of which the state commissioner of taxation and finance has been notified
    pursuant to section one hundred seventy-one-c, one hundred seventy-one-d, one hundred seventy-one-e, one hundred seventy-one-f or one hundred seventy-one-l of the tax law, as the case may be, then an overpayment and interest thereon shall be credited
    against such past-due support, or a past-due legally enforceable debt, or a city of New York tax warrant judgment debt, or such amount of a default in repayment of a guaranteed student, state university or city university loan, unless the spouse not
    liable for such past-due support, or a past-due legally enforceable debt, or a city of New York tax warrant judgment debt, or such amount of a default in repayment of a guaranteed student, state university or city university loan demands, on a declaration
    made in accordance with regulations or instructions prescribed by the state commissioner of taxation and finance, that the portion of the overpayment and interest attributable to such spouse not be credited against the past-due support, or a past-due
    legally enforceable debt, or a city of New York tax warrant judgment debt, or amount of a default in repayment of a guaranteed student, state university or city university loan owed by the other spouse. Upon such demand, the state commissioner of
    taxation and finance shall determine the amount of the overpayment attributable to each spouse in accordance with regulations prescribed by the state commissioner of taxation and finance and credit only that portion of the overpayment and interest
    thereon attributable to the spouse liable for past-due support, or a past-due legally enforceable debt, or a city of New York tax warrant judgment debt, or amount of a default in repayment of a guaranteed student, state university or city university
    loan against such past-due support, or a past-due legally enforceable debt, or a city of New York tax warrant judgment debt, or such amount of a default in repayment of a guaranteed student, state university or city university loan. Such demand may
    be filed (A) with the return of the spouse not liable for past-due support or past-due legally enforceable debt, or a city of New York tax warrant judgment debt, or default in repayment of a guaranteed student, state university, or city university
    loan or (B) with the commissioner of taxation and finance within ten days after notification is provided such spouse by the commissioner of taxation and finance pursuant to subdivision seven of section one hundred seventy-one-c, subdivision six of
    section one hundred seventy-one-d, subdivision seven of section one hundred seventy-one-e, subdivision seven of section one hundred seventy-one-f or subdivision six of section one hundred seventy-one-l of the New York state tax law. (6) The state
    commissioner of taxation and finance shall clearly alert married taxpayers, on all appropriate publications and instructions, that their liability for tax will be joint and several if they file joint income tax returns. The state commissioner of taxation
    and finance shall include notice of an individual&#39;s right to relief from joint and several liability pursuant to section six hundred fifty-four of the tax law in the disclosure of rights statement required by section three thousand four of the tax
    law and in any notice regarding collection of tax due with respect to a liability on a joint return. (c) Decedents. The return for any deceased individual shall be made and filed by his or her executor, administrator, or other person charged with
    his or her property. If a final return of a decedent is for a fractional part of a year, the due date of such return shall be the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the close of the twelve-month period which began with the first day of such
    fractional part of the year. (d) Individuals under a disability. The return for an individual who is unable to make a return by reason of minority or other disability shall be made and filed by his or her guardian, committee, fiduciary or other person
    charged with the care of his or her person or property (other than a receiver in possession of only a part of his or her property), or by his or her duly authorized agent. (e) Estates and trusts. The return for an estate or trust shall be made and
    filed by the fiduciary. (f) Joint fiduciaries. If two or more fiduciaries are acting jointly, the return may be made by any one of them. (h) Tax a debt. Any tax under this chapter, and any increase, interest or penalty thereon, shall, from the time
    it is due and payable, be a personal debt of the person liable to pay the same, to the city of New York. (i) Cross reference.
