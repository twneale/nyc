                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/nyc/adc/sections/23-403.html'>§ 23-403</a> Powers of commissioner. a. The commissioner may issue and renew permits under this chapter based upon a determination, at his or her discretion, that issuance or renewal of a permit would be in the best interests of the city, provided that:
    1. no permit shall be issued or renewed unless the applicant holds a franchise granted by the city to install, operate and maintain public pay telephones on, over and under the streets and other inalienable property of the city; 2. (i) in the event
    that the installation of a public pay telephone requires the opening, drilling or other physical alteration of a building facade or other private property, no permit shall be issued or renewed without the written consent of the building owner. (ii)
    in the event that the installation of a public pay telephone requires affixing the phone to a building facade or other private property, no permit shall be issued or renewed without the written consent of the building owner. (iii) in the event the
    installation of a public pay telephone is to be accomplished in a manner other than as set forth in subsection (i) and (ii) of this section, but requires access through an existing conduit or other opening on a building facade or other private property,
    or such installation is to be made within six feet of a building line, no permit shall be issued or renewed without the written consent of the building owner or the commercial lessee who shall certify (aa) that the building owner has authorized the
    lessee to grant such consents; and (bb) that the lessee has provided the building owner or its authorized agent with written notification by certified mail, of the granting of such consent, the name and address of the owner of the public pay telephone
    and the location of such public pay telephone in relation to the building. Proof of mailing of such notification to the building owner or its authorized agent shall be included in the permit application. It shall be a violation of this chapter where
    a permittee, without providing justification therefor, fails within a time period specified by the Commissioner to remove a public pay telephone following receipt of a notice from the building owner or its authorized agent by certified mail that he
    or she objects to the installation, where such notice and copy to the Commissioner are sent within thirty days of receipt of the commercial lessee&#39;s consent. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit a building owner or its authorized agent from
    pursuing such remedies as he or she may have under law with respect to the unauthorized installation of a public pay telephone; and 3. no permit shall be issued or renewed for the installation, operation and maintenance of a public pay telephone at
    any location where it will unreasonably interfere with the use of a street by the public, or where it will unreasonably interfere with the use of the abutting property. b. The commissioner shall promulgate rules to implement the provisions of this
    chapter. Such rules shall include, without limitation: (i) a procedure and timetable for review by the department, and other appropriate agencies, including the department of transportation, of applications for the issuance and renewal of permits
    to install, operate and maintain public pay telephones at specified locations; (ii) standards governing the location of public pay telephones designed so as to ensure that such telephones will not unreasonably interfere with the use of the street
    by the public and with use of the abutting property; and (iii) standards and procedures governing the installation, removal, operation, cleaning and maintenance of public pay telephones, including procedures for the expedited removal of any public
    pay telephone determined to constitute a public nuisance. c. Permits may contain such other terms and conditions not specifically provided for in this chapter as the commissioner deems necessary to protect the public safety and to safeguard the interests
    of the city.</span>
