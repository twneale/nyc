                    <span class="" style="">* <a href='//sections/26-504.html'>§ 26-504</a> Application. This law shall apply to: a. Class A multiple dwellings not owned as a cooperative or as a condominium, except as provided in section three hundred fifty-two-eeee of the general business law, containing six or more dwelling units
    which: (1) were completed after February first, nineteen hundred forty-seven, except dwelling units (a) owned or leased by, or financed by loans from, a public agency or public benefit corporation, (b) subject to rent regulation under the private
    housing finance law or any other state law, (c) aided by government insurance under any provision of the national housing act, to the extent this chapter or any regulation or order issued thereunder is inconsistent therewith, or (d) located in a building
    for which a certificate of occupancy is obtained after March tenth, nineteen hundred sixty-nine; or (e) any class A multiple dwelling which on June first, nineteen hundred sixty-eight was and still is commonly regarded as a hotel, transient hotel
    or residential hotel, and which customarily provides hotel service such as maid service, furnishing and laundering of linen, telephone and bell boy service, secretarial or desk service and use and upkeep of furniture and fixtures, or (f) not occupied
    by the tenant, not including subtenants or occupants, as his or her primary residence, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, provided, however that no action or proceeding shall be commenced seeking to recover possession on the ground
    that a housing accommodation is not occupied by the tenant as his or her primary residence unless the owner or lessor shall have given thirty days notice to the tenant of his or her intention to commence such action or proceeding on such grounds.
    For the purposes of determining primary residency, a tenant who is a victim of domestic violence, as defined in section four hundred fifty-nine-a of the social services law, who has left the unit because of such violence, and who asserts an intent
    to return to the housing accommodation shall be deemed to be occupying the unit as his or her primary residence. For the purposes of this subparagraph where a housing accommodation is rented to a not-for-profit hospital for residential use, affiliated
    subtenants authorized to use such accommodations by such hospital shall be deemed to be tenants, or (g) became vacant on or after June thirtieth, nineteen hundred seventy-one, or become vacant, provided however, that this exemption shall not apply
    or become effective with respect to housing accommodations which the commissioner determines or finds became vacant because the landlord or any person acting on his or her behalf, with intent to cause the tenant to vacate, engaged in any course of
    conduct (including but not limited to, interruption or discontinuance of essential services) which interfered with or disturbed or was intended to interfere with or disturb the comfort, repose, peace or quiet of the tenant in his or her use or occupancy
    of the housing accommodations and provided further that any housing accommodations exempted by this paragraph shall be subject to this law to the extent provided in subdivision b of this section; or (2) were decontrolled by the city rent agency pursuant
    to <a href='//sections/26-414.html'>section 26-414</a> of this title; or (3) are exempt from control by virtue of item one, two, six or seven of subparagraph (i) of paragraph two of subdivision e of <a href='//sections/26-403.html'>section 26-403</a> of this title; and b. Other housing accommodations in class A or class
    B multiple dwellings made subject to this law pursuant to the emergency tenant protection act of nineteen seventy-four. c. Dwelling units in a building or structure receiving the benefits of <a href='//sections/11-243.html'>section 11-243</a> or <a href='//sections/11-244.html'>section 11-244</a> of the code or article
    eighteen of the private housing finance law, not owned as a cooperative or as a condominium, except as provided in section three hundred fifty-two-eeee of the general business law and not subject to chapter three of this title. Upon the expiration
    or termination for any reason of the benefits of <a href='//sections/11-243.html'>section 11-243</a> or <a href='//sections/11-244.html'>section 11-244</a> of the code or article eighteen of the private housing finance law any such dwelling unit shall be subject to this chapter until the occurrence of the first vacancy
    of such unit after such benefits are no longer being received or if each lease and renewal thereof for such unit for the tenant in residence at the time of the expiration of the tax benefit period has included a notice in at least twelve point type
    informing such tenant that the unit shall become subject to deregulation upon the expiration of such tax benefit period and states the approximate date on which such tax benefit period is scheduled to expire, such dwelling unit shall be deregulated
    as of the end of the tax benefit period; provided, however, that if such dwelling unit would have been subject to this chapter or the emergency tenant protection act of nineteen seventy-four in the absence of this subdivision, such dwelling unit shall,
    upon the expiration of such benefits, continue to be subject to this chapter or the emergency tenant protection act of nineteen seventy-four to the same extent and in the same manner as if this subdivision had never applied thereto. * NB Expires April
