(a) No person shall cause or permit the use or operation of equipment or apparatus for which an installation or alteration permit is required, except for the purpose

    or in paragraphs three and four of subdivision (b) of <a href='/adc/sections/24-109.html'>section 24-109</a>, no person shall cause or permit the use or operation of the following equipment, or cause or permit the keeping of any such equipment so as to be capable of being used or operated,
    without first obtaining an operating certificate from the commissioner. (1) Fuel burning equipment using liquid, gaseous or solid fuel; * (2) Equipment used in a process; * NB Amended L.L. 49/85 § 3, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14 (3) Portable

    ninth, nineteen hundred eighty-three. (c) An operating certificate is not required for fuel burning equipment or refuse burning equipment which is in a building to be demolished to permit the erection of a new building if: (1) The new building application
    has been approved by the department of buildings; and (2) Certificates of eviction have been issued by the department of housing preservation and development where required; and (3) Final order for eviction has been issued. * (d) (1) An operating
    certificate for equipment, except refuse burning equipment, shall be valid for a period of up to three years from the date of issuance, unless sooner revoked or cancelled by the commissioner. (2) An operating certificate for refuse burning equipment
    shall be valid for a period of up to eighteen months from the date of issuance, unless sooner revoked or cancelled by the commissioner. (3) Where an operating certificate described in paragraph one or paragraph two of this subdivision is renewed after
    its expiration, the fee for such certificate charged in accordance with the provisions of this chapter shall be increased on a monthly pro-rated basis for the period of time between such expiration and renewal, unless it is shown to the satisfaction
    of the commissioner that such certificate was not required under the provisions of this title. * NB Added Ch. L.L. 49/85 § 4, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14 (e) An operating certificate is not required for equipment or apparatus the installation

    the department within twenty days on forms furnished by the department. If the commissioner finds to his or her satisfaction that such equipment or apparatus has been dismantled or rendered inoperable, renewal of the operating certificate shall not
    be required for as long as the equipment or apparatus remains dismantled or inoperable.
