The city collector or the deputy collector in each borough office of the city collector shall enter upon accounts, to be maintained in each such office for each parcel of property, the payment
    of taxes, assessments, sewer rents or water rents thereon, the amount therefor, and the date when paid. The city collector shall daily enter into suitable books to be kept for the purpose of such accounts, such payments and the respective parcels
    on account of which the same were paid. b. At close of office hours each day, the city collector shall render to the commissioner of finance or the deputy commissioner of finance in such borough, a statement of the sums so received, and at the same
    time pay over to such commissioner of finance or deputy commissioner of finance, the amount received on such day. The city collector shall thereupon receive from such commissioner of finance or deputy commissioner of finance a voucher for the payment
    of such sums which he or she shall exhibit to the comptroller not later than the next succeeding business day. c. At the close of office hours each day, the city collector shall also furnish a statement to the comptroller who shall file the same in
    his or her office. Such statement shall indicate in detail such sums so received and the respective parcels on account of which the same were paid. The comptroller shall, on each day, immediately after receiving such statement, compare it with a voucher
    furnished to him or her by the commissioner of finance indicating the sums which have been paid on such day to the commissioner of finance and if the aggregate amounts thereof shall correspond, shall credit the city collector in his or her books with
    such amount.</span>
