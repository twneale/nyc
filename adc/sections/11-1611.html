                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/adc/sections/11-1611.html'>§ 11-1611</a> Refunds. a. In the manner provided in this section the commissioner of finance shall refund or credit, without interest, any tax, penalty or interest erroneously, illegally or unconstitionally collected or paid if application to the commissioner
    of finance for such refund shall be made within one year from the payment thereof. Whenever a refund is made by the commissioner of finance, the commissioner shall state his or her reasons therefor in writing. Such application may be made by the seller
    or supplier or the retailer or other person who has actually paid the tax. The commissioner of finance may, in lieu of any refund required to be made, allow credit therefor on payments due from the applicant. b. An application for a refund or credit
    made as herein provided shall be deemed an application for revision of any tax, penalty or interest complained of. If the commissioner of finance, prior to any hearing held, initially denies the application for refund, the commissioner shall give
    notice of such determination of denial to the applicant. Such determination shall be final and irrevocable unless the applicant, within thirty days after the giving of notice of such determination, shall apply to the commissioner of finance for a
    hearing, or unless the commissioner of finance of his or her own motion shall redetermine the same. After such hearing the commissioner of finance shall give notice of his or her determination to the applicant, who shall be entitled to review such
    determination by a proceeding pursuant to article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules, provided such proceeding is instituted within four months after the giving of the notice of such determination, and provided that a final determination
    of tax was not previously made. Such a proceeding shall not be instituted unless an undertaking is filed with the commissioner of finance in such amount and with such sureties as a justice of the supreme court shall approve to the effect that if such
    proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the petitioner shall pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding. c. A person shall not be entitled to a revision, refund or credit under this section of a tax, interest
    or penalty which had been determined to be due pursuant to the provisions of <a href='/adc/sections/11-1610.html'>section 11-1610</a> of this chapter where such person has had a hearing or an opportunity for a hearing, as provided in said section, or has failed to avail himself or herself
    of the remedies therein provided. No refund or credit shall be made of a tax, interest or penalty paid after a determination by the commissioner of finance made pursuant to <a href='/adc/sections/11-1609.html'>section 11-1609</a> of this chapter unless it be found that such determination
    was erroneous, illegal or unconstitutional or otherwise improper, by the commissioner of finance after a hearing or of the commissioner&#39;s own motion, or in a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules, pursuant to the
    provisions of said section, in which event refund or credit without interest shall be made of the tax, interest or penalty found to have been overpaid.</span>
