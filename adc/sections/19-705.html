    of handrails. 3. A maximum running slope of 1:12 and a maximum cross slope of 1:48, subject to reasonable and minor variations under extreme and unusual tidal conditions. 4. Edge protection on each side. 5. A design that ensures that no water will
    accumulate on walking surfaces. 6. A rise which may exceed 30 inches. 7. A length which may exceed 30 feet between level landings; provided, however, that such slope may not exceed 1:12 subject to reasonable and minor variations under extreme and
    unusual tidal conditions. c. Transition plates. Transition plates shall provide or satisfy each of the following criteria: 1. A maximum slope of 1:12. 2. A minimum clear width of 36 inches. 3. Handrails on each side, where the length of a transition
    plate exceeds 24 inches. 4. The transition from the deck to the transition plate may be vertical without edge treatment up to 1/4 inch. Changes in level between 1/4 inch and 1/2 inch shall be beveled with a slope no greater than 1:2. 5. Transition
    plates that are 36 inches or less in length shall support a minimum load of 300 lbs. Transition plates that are greater than 36 inches in length shall support a minimum load of 100 lbs. per square foot. d. On board maneuvering space and clear paths.
    On board maneuvering space and clear paths shall provide or satisfy each of the following criteria: 1. An on board maneuvering space shall be provided adjacent to the accessible opening in the bulwarks, lifelines, deck rails or toe rails which is
    either (i) 60 inches minimum by 60 inches minimum or (ii) 42 inches minimum in depth and starting at one side of the opening and extending 80 inches minimum in width across the opening (see figure 1, L-Shaped Space, as set forth in this subdivision).
    2. At least one clear path of at least 32 inches in width shall run from each point of embarkation and disembarkation to all facilities available to the general public on the level of such water borne commuter services vessel where such point of embarkation
    or disembarkation is located. ______________________________________________________________ 1 | 2 | 3 COPY OF FIGURE 1 | 4 MAY BE OBTAINED FROM: | 5 NYS LEGISLATIVE BILL DRAFTING COMMISSION | 6 CONTACT: LEGISLATIVE RETRIEVAL SYSTEM&#39;S HELPLINE | 7

    with subdivision (f) of this section. 3. The number of clear deck spaces shall be provided in accordance with Table 1 of this subdivision and shall be dispersed throughout the water borne commuter vessel&#39;s passenger areas; provided, however, that
    at least one such space shall be provided on any outdoor passenger area on water borne commuter vessels with a passenger capacity of 101 or more. Table 1. Clear Deck Spaces Passenger capacity of water borne commuter vessel Minimum Number 0 to 100
    2 101 to 149 4 150 and above 6 4. This subdivision does not apply to spaces reachable only by vertical or inclined ladder. f. Tie-down systems. Tie-down systems for securing wheelchairs within water borne commuter vessels shall provide or satisfy
    each of the following criteria: 1. Each tie-down system shall consist of any tie-down system acceptable for taxi, van or bus transportation as provided under the United States department of transportation regulations or four d-rings securely fastened

    vessel loading equipment leads directly to a point of embarkation or disembarkation that is permitted to be 32 inches in width under the terms of this chapter, such vessel loading equipment may narrow to a width of 32 inches at that end that abuts
    such 32 inch point of embarkation or disembarkation. 6. Edge protection on each side. 7. Any vessel loading equipment that is 30 inches or longer in length shall support a minimum load of 600 lbs. placed at the center of such vessel loading equipment
    and distributed over an area of 26 inches by 26 inches, with a safety factor of at least 3 based on the ultimate strength of the material. Vessel loading equipment shorter than 30 inches shall support a minimum load of 300 lbs.</span>
