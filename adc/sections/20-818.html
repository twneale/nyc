                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/nyc/adc/sections/20-818.html'>§ 20-818</a> Penalties. a. Any pregnancy services center that violates the provisions of sections 20-816 or 20-817 of this subchapter or any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder shall be liable for a civil penalty of not less than two hundred dollars
    nor more than one thousand dollars for the first violation and a civil penalty of not less than five hundred dollars nor more than two thousand-five hundred dollars for each succeeding violation. b. (1) If any pregnancy services center is found to
    have violated the provisions of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/20-816.html'>section 20-816</a> on three or more separate occasions within two years, then, in addition to imposing the penalties set forth in subdivision a of this section, the commissioner, after notice and a hearing, shall be authorized
    to order that the pregnancy services center be sealed for a period not to exceed five consecutive days, except that such premises may be entered with the permission of the commissioner solely for actions necessary to remedy past violations of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/20-816.html'>section
    20-816</a> or prevent future violations or to make the premises safe. For the purposes of this subdivision, any violations at a pregnancy services center shall not be included in determining the number of violations of any subsequently established pregnancy
    services center at that location unless the commissioner establishes that the subsequent operator of such pregnancy services center acquired the premises or pregnancy services center, in whole or in part, for the purpose of permitting the previous
    operator of the pregnancy services center who had been found guilty of violating <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/20-816.html'>section 20-816</a> of this subchapter to avoid the effect of such violations. (2) Orders of the commissioner issued pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision shall be
    posted at the premises that are the subject of the order(s). (3) Ten days after the posting of an order issued pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision, and upon the written directive of the commissioner, officers and employees of the department
    and officers of the New York city police department are authorized to act upon and enforce such orders. (4) A closing directed by the department pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision shall not constitute an act of possession, ownership or
    control by the city of the closed premises. (5) Mutilation or removal of a posted order of the commissioner or his designee shall be punishable by a fine of not more than two hundred fifty dollars or by imprisonment not exceeding fifteen days, or
    both, provided such order contains therein a notice of such penalty. Any other intentional disobedience or resistance to any provision of the orders issued pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision, including using or occupying or permitting any
    other person to use or occupy any premises ordered closed without the permission of the department as described in subdivision b shall, in addition to any other punishment prescribed by law, be punishable by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars,
    or by imprisonment not exceeding six months, or both. c. For the purposes of this section, all violations committed on any one day by any one pregnancy services center shall constitute a single violation.
