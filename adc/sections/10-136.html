                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/nyc/adc/sections/10-136.html'>§ 10-136</a> Prohibition against certain forms of aggressive solicitation. a. Definitions. For purposes of this section: (1) &quot;Aggressive manner&quot; shall mean: (a) Approaching or speaking to a person, or following a person before, during or after soliciting,
    asking or begging, if that conduct is intended or is likely to cause a reasonable person to (i) fear bodily harm to oneself or to another, damage to or loss of property, or the commission of any offense as defined in section ten of the penal law upon
    oneself or another, or (ii) otherwise be intimidated into giving money or other thing of value, or (iii) suffer unreasonable inconvenience, annoyance or alarm; (b) Intentionally touching or causing physical contact with another person or an occupied
    vehicle without that person&#39;s consent in the course of soliciting, asking or begging; (c) Intentionally blocking or interfering with the safe or free passage of a pedestrian or vehicle by any means, including unreasonably causing a pedestrian or vehicle
    operator to take evasive action to avoid physical contact; or (d) Using violent or threatening gestures toward a person solicited. (2) &quot;Solicit, ask or beg&quot; shall include using the spoken, written, or printed word, or bodily gestures, signs or other
    means with the purpose of obtaining an immediate donation of money or other thing of value or soliciting the sale of goods or services. (3) &quot;Public place&quot; shall mean a place to which the public or a substantial group of persons has access, and includes,
    but is not limited to, any street, highway, parking lot, plaza, transportation facility, school, place of amusement, park, playground, and any hallway, lobby and other portion of an apartment house or hotel not constituting a room or apartment designed
    for actual residence. (4) &quot;Bank&quot; shall mean any banking corporation as defined in section 11-164 of the code. (5) &quot;Check cashing business&quot; shall mean any person duly licensed by the superintendent of banks to engage in the business of cashing checks,
    drafts or money orders for consideration pursuant to the provisions of article 9-A of the banking law. (6) &quot;Automated teller machine&quot; shall mean a device, linked to a financial institution&#39;s account records, which is able to carry out transactions,
    including, but not limited to: account transfers, deposits, cash withdrawals, balance inquiries, and mortgage and loan payments. (7) &quot;Automated teller machine facility&quot; shall mean the area comprised of one or more automated teller machines, and any
    adjacent space which is made available to banking customers after regular banking hours. b. Prohibited acts. (1) No person shall solicit, ask or beg in an aggressive manner in any public place. (2) No person shall solicit, ask or beg within ten feet
    of any entrance or exit of any bank or check cashing business during its business hours or within ten feet of any automated teller machine during the time it is available for customers&#39; use. Provided, however, that when an automated teller machine
    is located within an automated teller machine facility, such distance shall be measured from the entrance or exit of the automated teller machine facility. Provided further that no person shall solicit, ask or beg within an automated teller machine
    facility where a reasonable person would or should know that he or she does not have the permission to do so from the owner or other person lawfully in possession of such facility. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prohibit the lawful
    vending of goods and services within such areas. (3) No person shall approach an operator or other occupant of a motor vehicle while such vehicle is located on any street, for the purpose of either performing or offering to perform a service in connection
    with such vehicle or otherwise soliciting the sale of goods or services, if such approaching, performing, offering or soliciting is done in an aggressive manner as defined in paragraph one of subdivision a of this section. Provided, however, that
    this paragraph shall not apply to services rendered in connection with the lawful towing of such vehicle or in connection with emergency repairs requested by the operator or other occupant of such vehicle. c. Exemptions. The provisions of this section
    shall not apply to any unenclosed automated teller machine located within any building, structure or space whose primary purpose or function is unrelated to banking activities, including but not limited to supermarkets, airports and school buildings,
    provided that such automated teller machine shall be available for use only during the regular hours of operation of the building, structure or space in which such machine is located. d. Penalties. Any violation of the provisions of this section shall
    constitute a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than sixteen days or by a fine not to exceed one hundred dollars, or by both.</span>
