                    <span class="" style=""><a href='//sections/24-718.html'>§ 24-718</a> Risk management plan. (a) On or before March first of each year beginning in nineteen hundred ninety-five, a responsible party of a facility where an extremely hazardous substance or a regulated toxic substance is present in an amount that
    equals or exceeds the threshold planning quantities established by the United States environmental protection agency in regulations promulgated pursuant to applicable law, shall file with the commissioner a risk management plan in accordance with
    the provisions of this section. Where a substance is classified as both an extremely hazardous substance and a regulated toxic substance and different threshold planning quantities have been established, the lower threshold planning quantity shall
    apply in determining whether such a substance is present at a facility in an amount that equals or exceeds the threshold planning quantities. (b) Review of risk management plans. (1) Within thirty days after receipt of a risk management plan, the
    commissioner shall determine whether such plan is complete. If the commissioner determines that the plan is incomplete, then he or she shall notify the responsible party that the plan is incomplete and identify in what respect the plan is incomplete.
    Within fifteen days after such notification, the responsible party shall file a revised plan consistent with the commissioner&#39;s notification. Within fifteen days after receipt of such revised plan, the commissioner shall determine whether the revised
    plan is complete. (2) Within ninety days after the commissioner&#39;s determination that the responsible party has filed a complete plan, the commissioner shall approve or make modifications to such plan and shall notify the responsible party filing such
    plan in writing of his or her approval or modifications. The commissioner shall, within a reasonable period of time prior to approving or making modifications to such plan, submit such plan to the commissioner of the fire department and the commissioner
    of the fire department may recommend modifications to such plan to the commissioner. (3) If the commissioner makes modifications to the responsible party&#39;s risk management plan, the responsible party shall incorporate such modifications into its risk
    management plan, provided, however, that the responsible party may, within forty-five days after receipt of such modifications, submit alternative modifications to the commissioner or explain why the commissioner&#39;s modifications are not necessary.
    The commissioner shall within forty-five days review the alternative modifications or explanation and shall: (i) require the responsible party to incorporate, by a date certain not to exceed forty-five days, either the commissioner&#39;s modifications,
    the alternative modifications or a combination of such modifications into its risk management plan, (ii) approve the unmodified plan or (iii) disapprove the plan. (4) The commissioner shall provide a copy of each approved risk management plan to the
    emergency response agencies and to other governmental entities that may request an approved plan. (c) On or before July first, nineteen hundred ninety-four, the commissioner, in consultation with the emergency response agencies, shall by rule establish
    the contents of a risk management plan, which shall be designed to prevent the accidental release and to minimize the consequences of any such release of any extremely hazardous or regulated toxic substance. The plan shall include but need not be
    limited to: (1) a site plan; (2) a safety review of design for new and existing equipment and processes; (3) an emergency response program, including an emergency response plan, emergency response training, and emergency response exercises; (4) standard
    operating procedures; (5) a preventive maintenance program for equipment; (6) a training program for equipment operators, including duration and type of training, and retraining; (7) accident investigation procedures; and (8) a risk assessment program,
    including a hazard analysis and a consideration of the use of alternate equipment and alternate substances. (d) Preparation of risk management plan. The risk management plan shall be prepared by one or more of the following persons: an industrial
    hygienist certified by the American Board of Industrial Hygienists, a professional engineer licensed pursuant to section 7206 of the New York state education law, a safety professional certified by the Board of Certified Safety Professionals, or other
    qualified person authorized by rule of the commissioner. A plan submitted pursuant to this section shall contain proof satisfactory to the commissioner of the qualifications of the person who prepared such plan. (e) The risk management plan shall
    be made available to department personnel at the time of an inspection of a facility for which a plan is required pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section. (f) On or before November first, nineteen hundred ninety-four, the commissioner, in consultation
    with emergency response agencies, shall make reasonable efforts to provide information to responsible parties regarding the requirements of this section and the rules promulgated hereunder.
