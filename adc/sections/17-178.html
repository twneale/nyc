For the purposes of this section, the following terms shall be defined as follows: 1. &quot;Bar&quot; means any establishment which is devoted to the sale and service of

    operator or other person having control of an establishment. 4. &quot;Public place&quot; means a restaurant, bar, theatre or health club. 5. &quot;Restaurant&quot; means any commercial eating establishment which is devoted, wholly or in part, to the sale of food for

    resuscitation equipment in quantities deemed adequate by the department. Such equipment shall be readily accessible for use during medical emergencies. Any information deemed necessary by the commissioner shall accompany the resuscitation equipment.
    Resuscitation equipment shall be discarded after a single use. c. Notice required. The owner or operator of a public place shall provide notice to patrons, by means of signs, printed material or other means of written communication, indicating the

    for the death of such person alleged to have occurred by reason of an act or omission in the rendering of such emergency treatment unless it is established that the injuries were or death was caused by gross negligence on the part of the rescuer.
    e. No duty to act. Nothing contained in this section shall impose any duty or obligation on any owner or operator of a public place, his or her employee or other agent, or any other person to provide resuscitation assistance to the victim of a medical
    emergency.</span>
