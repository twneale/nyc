    for the death of such person alleged to have occurred by reason of an act or omission in the rendering of such emergency treatment unless it is established that the injuries were or death was caused by gross negligence on the part of the rescuer.
    e. No duty to act. Nothing contained in this section shall impose any duty or obligation on any owner or operator of a public place, his or her employee or other agent, or any other person to provide resuscitation assistance to the victim of a medical
