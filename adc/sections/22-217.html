In addition to the penalties provided in <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/22-215.html'>section 22-215</a> of this chapter, the commissioner may, after due notice and opportunity for a hearing, take action pursuant
    to subdivisions b and c of this section. b. The commissioner may revoke or suspend a license or class A photo identification card issued pursuant to the provisions of this chapter when the licensee and/or a principal, employee or agent of a licensee
    or a person to whom such photo identification card has been issued: (i) has been found to be in violation of this chapter or any rules promulgated pursuant thereto; (ii) has repeatedly failed to obey lawful orders of the market manager or his or her
    staff; (iii) has failed to pay any fines or civil penalties imposed pursuant to this chapter or the rules promulgated pursuant thereto; (iv) has been found in violation of any laws prohibiting deceptive, unfair, or unconscionable trade practices,
    or has been found in persistent or substantial violation of any city, state, or federal law, rule or regulation regarding the handling of seafood; (v) whenever, in relation to an investigation conducted pursuant to this chapter, the commissioner determines,
    after consideration of the factors set forth in subdivision b of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/22-216.html'>section 22-216</a> of this chapter, that the licensee, any principal of the licensee or a person required to possess a class A photo identification card lacks good character, honesty and
    integrity; (vi) whenever there has been any false statement or misrepresentation as to a material fact in the application or accompanying papers upon which the issuance or renewal of the license or photo identification card was based; or (vii) whenever
    the licensee has failed to notify the market manager of any material change, as required by rules promulgated by the commissioner pursuant to <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/22-223.html'>section 22-223</a> of this chapter, in the information required to be provided on the application for such license,
    or of the arrest or criminal conviction of the licensee or any of the principals of the licensee, or of the arrest or criminal conviction of any employees or agents of the licensee of which the licensee had knowledge or should have known. c. The commissioner
    may revoke or suspend a registration or a class B photo identification card issued pursuant to this chapter when the person to whom such registration or card was issued: (i) has been found to be in persistent or substantial violation of this chapter
    or any rules promulgated pursuant thereto; (ii) has repeatedly failed to obey lawful orders of the market manager or his or her staff; (iii) whenever there has been any false statement or misrepresentation as to a material fact in the papers upon
    which registration or issuance of the photo identification card was based; (iv) has failed to pay any fines or civil penalties imposed pursuant to this chapter or the rules promulgated pursuant thereto; (v) has been found in violation of any laws
    prohibiting deceptive, unfair, or unconscionable trade practices, or has been found in persistent or substantial violation of any city, state, or federal law, rule or regulation regarding the handling of seafood; (vi) has been found in violation of
    any city, state or federal law, rule or regulation when such violation is inimical to the purpose and intent of this chapter; or (vii) has failed to notify the commissioner of any material change, in the information submitted in the application for
    registration, or of the arrest or criminal conviction of the registrant or any of the principals of the registrant, or of the arrest or criminal conviction of any employees or agents of the registrant of which the registrant had knowledge or should
    have known. d. An order of suspension pursuant to this section shall specify the period during which such suspension shall remain in effect; such period shall be reasonable in relationship to the violation or violations underlying the suspensions.
    e. For purposes of this section: (i) &quot;persistent&quot; shall mean three or more violations within a six month period; and (ii) &quot;substantial violation&quot; shall mean a violation which has a bearing on the continued fitness of a licensee, registrant or holder
    of a photo identification card to operate a business or work in the market area.</span>
