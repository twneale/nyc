                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/nyc/adc/sections/27-710.html'>§ 27-710</a> Compacted concrete piles. (a) Description. A &quot;compacted concrete pile&quot; shall denote a concrete pile formed with an enlarged base in which the concrete in the base is placed in small batches that are compacted prior to attaining an initial set.
    The concrete in the shaft of the pile shall be placed as specified in <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/27-709.html'>section 27-709</a> of this article for cast-in-place concrete piles if a permanent casting is provided, or in small batches that are compacted. (b) Materials. Concrete for compacted
    concrete piles shall conform to the requirements of article five of subchapter ten of this chapter. Concrete to be compacted shall have a minimum compressive strength at the age of twenty-eight days of four thousand psi and shall be mixed with sufficient
    water to permit hydration of the cement, but the slump shall be zero. The concrete shall be placed and compacted before initial set can occur. Non-compacted concrete, if used for the pile shafts, shall conform to the requirements for cast-in-place
    concrete piles. (c) Spacing. Minimum spacing between compacted concrete piles shall be four feet six inches, center to center except that where the shafts of such piles are cased for their full length, this spacing may be reduced to three feet six
    inches. Where a question exists as to possible damage to adjacent previously driven piles, these minimums shall be increased. (d) Installation. (1) The base shall be formed by ramming concrete, in batches of approximately five cubic feet or less,
    from a drive casing and into the soil. Unless specifically otherwise permitted by the commissioner, a minimum of twenty blows of at least one hundred forty thousand foot-pounds per blow shall be required for extrusion of the last five cubic feet of
    concrete. The total quantity of concrete extruded from the drive casing to form the base shall be equal to or greater than the quantity so extruded in the case of the nearest successful applicable test pile, except that a compactive effort in excess
    of thirty blows, each of one hundred forty thousand foot-pounds, will not be required for extrusion of the last five cubic feet. (2) After the expanded base has been formed, the shaft shall be constructed. Where a cased shaft is to be used, a steel
    shell shall be inserted into the drive casing and anchored to the expanded base by placing a fresh charge of concrete in the shell and driving it into the base. The shell may then be filled with concrete to cut-off elevation after the removal of the
    drive casing, in accordance with the provisions relating to cast-in-place concrete piles. Any annular space remaining between the shell and surrounding soil shall be suitably filled to assure proper lateral support of the shaft, unless there is sufficient
    recovery of the ground to provide the necessary support. Where an uncased shaft is to be used, the provisions of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/27-697.html'>section 27-697</a> of article seven of this subchapter shall apply, and the concrete for the shaft shall be placed by ramming or by the use
    of approved pressure devices as the drive casing is withdrawn. Where ramming is used, the concrete batches being rammed shall not exceed five cubic feet in volume, not less than two blows of thirty thousand foot-pounds each shall be applied to compact
    each batch of concrete, and the bottom of the drive casing shall be kept below the level of the concrete at all times. (3) The outside diameter of the permanent shaft shall not be more than four inches less than the inside diameter of the drive casing.
    (4) Except where uncased shafts are used, as described in <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/27-697.html'>section 27-697</a> of article seven of this subchapter, no concrete shall be placed in the pile shafts until all piles within a radius of fifteen feet, or within the heave range, have been driven.
    (e) Bearing material. The enlarged base of the pile shall be formed in, or on the same type of bearing material as is used to support the nearest applicable load test pile and at a similar depth therein. In addition, the enlarged base shall be underlain
    by a minimum depth of ten feet (measured from the junction of the shaft and base) of soil materials of classes 1-65 to 7-65, except that, where installation of the base is permitted to be performed with blows of less energy than the one hundred forty
    thousand foot-pounds indicated in paragraph one of subdivision (d) of this section, the requirement for a ten foot depth of class 1-65 to 7-65 material may be reduced, subject to the approval of the architect or engineer and the aproval of the commissioner.</span>
