                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/nyc/adc/sections/22-204.html'>§ 22-204</a> Unloading business license required. a. It shall be unlawful to conduct an unloading business or otherwise provide unloading services in the fulton fish market distribution area without having first obtained an unloading business license from
    the commissioner pursuant to the provisions of this section. An unloading business license shall not be transferable. b. The commissioner shall issue a request for licensing proposals and shall, at his or her discretion, issue one or more unloading
    business licenses based upon the review and evaluation of responses received pursuant to such request. Such request for proposals shall solicit information regarding the qualifications of proposers, their proposed methods of unloading, the labor and
    equipment they propose to utilize in the unloading operation, rates proposed to be charged to wholesalers, procedures proposed to be used to comply with sanitary requirements, and any other information relating to performance standards, responsibility
    and service that the commissioner deems appropriate. A proposal in response to a request for licensing proposals issued pursuant to this section shall be submitted on behalf of a business entity by all the principals thereof on a form bearing the
    signatures of all such principals. c. A license issued pursuant to this section shall state the name, address and telephone number of the licensee and the names and business addresses of all principals of such licensee. A copy of such license shall
    be presented by the unloading business to any wholesaler upon request. d. A license issued pursuant to this section shall also contain conditions that: (i) specify the maximum rates to be charged to wholesalers; (ii) specify the standard and level
    of performance of unloading and customer service which shall be maintained throughout the term of the license to ensure the continuing efficient unloading of seafood in the market area; (iii) require that the unloading business obtain a performance
    bond or such other guarantee of performance that the commissioner determines is appropriate and sufficient to cover any cost incurred by the city in providing or performing unloading services pursuant to <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/22-208.html'>section 22-208</a> of this chapter due to revocation
    of the license or default in the performance of the conditions specified in the license and specify the amount of such performance bond or guarantee; and (iv) prescribe any other appropriate requirements relating to performance standards, customer
    service, security of performance, the use of city property, or such other matters as the commissioner deems appropriate and necessary to effectuate the purposes of this chapter. e. An unloading business licensed pursuant to this section may not charge
    more for the provision of unloading services than the maximum rate set forth in the license without the written permission of the commissioner, nor may an unloading business or any principal, employee or agent thereof request or accept any other fees
    or gratuities for performing unloading services. f. No unloading business licensee, shall, by contract or otherwise, assign or delegate to or engage any other business entity to provide the unloading services specified in the license, whether upon
    an emergency or any other basis, unless the commissioner has provided specific written authorization therefor. g. (i) The commissioner shall be authorized, upon due notice and opportunity for a hearing, to suspend or revoke a license issued pursuant
    to this section based upon a determination that there has been a default in the performance of the conditions specified in such license or for reasons set forth in sections 22-217 or 22-218 of this chapter. The commissioner shall also be authorized
    to pursue other remedies for a default in the performance of the conditions specified in the license, including but not limited to, reimbursement for any expenses incurred by the department in performing or providing unloading services in the market
    area. (ii) In the event of such suspension or revocation, or when the commissioner determines that additional unloading services are required because a licensee has discontinued unloading operations in the market area or the existing unloading business
    or businesses are for other reasons unable to provide adequate or sufficient unloading services in the market area, the commissioner may, as he or she deems appropriate, issue a new license to one or more business entities which responded to the most
    recent request for licensing proposals, issue a new request for licensing proposals pursuant to this section or arrange for the department, a designee of the department or an entity under contract to the department to provide unloading services in
    the market area. A new license issued pursuant to a request for licensing proposals shall be valid for the remainder of the term of the original license. The commissioner may also solicit expressions of interest from business entities in providing
    unloading services on a temporary basis and may issue a temporary license or licenses to provide unloading services in the market area to the most qualified of such entities in a situation where the suspension or revocation of a license or the discontinuance
    of unloading operations by a licensee has created a shortage of unloading services in the market area or the existing unloading business or businesses are for other reasons unable to provide adequate or sufficient unloading services. A temporary license
    issued pursuant to this subdivision shall be valid for a period of up to one year, provided that such license shall not extend beyond the remainder of the term of the original license. The fee for such temporary license shall be prorated to the term
    of the original license. h. Prior to the expiration of the term of a license issued pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall issue a new request for licensing proposals pursuant to subdivision b of this section. Where the term of such license
    has been extended for an additional period pursuant to <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/22-213.html'>section 22-213</a> of this chapter, the new request for licensing proposals shall be issued prior to the expiration of such period.</span>
