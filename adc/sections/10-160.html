    access to an automated teller machine facility, the issuing bank shall provide its customer with written information concerning safety precautions to be employed while using an automated teller machine facility. Such written information shall include
    at a minimum the information described in subparagraphs (i) through (v) of paragraph eight of subdivision b of this section. In addition, upon the effective date of the local law which added this section and for one year thereafter, such written information
    shall also include a statement indicating that notwithstanding efforts to restrict access to an automated teller machine facility located within the interior of a building to persons authorized to use an automated teller machine card or access code,
    entrance is sometimes obtained by persons who are not authorized to use the automated teller machine facility. g. Enforcement; statistics. (1) The police department, the department of consumer affairs, and the department of buildings shall be authorized
    to enforce this section. (2) Statistics of crimes associated with the use of automated teller machines compiled and maintained by the police department shall be made available upon the request of any bank. (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of section

    the effective date of the local law which added this section, and each year thereafter, every bank which has an automated teller machine facility which is in operation on such date or on such date every year thereafter, shall submit a written report
    to the commissioner of buildings, on a form prescribed by such commissioner, certifying that such automated teller machine facility is in compliance with the provisions of this section, or if such facility is not in compliance with the provisions
    of this section, such report shall state the manner in which such facility fails to meet the requirements of this section and the reasons for such non-compliance. Each such report shall be accompanied by a fee of one hundred dollars for each automated
    teller machine facility operated by the bank. i. Compliance with building code and all other applicable provisions of law. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to exempt or relieve any bank from complying with all relevant provisions
    of the building code and all other applicable provisions of law. j. Exemptions. The provisions of this section shall not apply to any unenclosed automated teller machine located in any building, structure or space whose primary purpose or function
    is unrelated to banking activities, including but not limited to supermarkets, airports and school buildings, provided that such automated teller machine shall be available for use only during the regular hours of operation of the building, structure
