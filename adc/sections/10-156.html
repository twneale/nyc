In addition to the enforcement procedures set forth in chapter seven of title seven of this code and any other law, the police commissioner or such commissioner&#39;s designee

    give notice and opportunity for a hearing to the owner, lessor, lessee and mortgagee of a building, erection or place wherein the public nuisance is being conducted, maintained or permitted. Notice shall be given as follows: (a) service of a notice
    of hearing may be made to owners and lessors by delivering such notice to the owner or lessor or to an agent of the owner or lessor or to a person of suitable age and discretion at the residence or place of business of the owner or lessor or, if upon
    reasonable application such delivery cannot be completed, by affixing such notice in a conspicuous place at the owner&#39;s or lessor&#39;s place of business or residence or by placing it under the entrance door at either of such locations or by delivering
    such notice to a person employed by the owner or lessor on the premises at which the nuisance is located and, in all instances except personal delivery upon such owner or lessor, by mailing the notice of hearing as follows: (i) to the person registered
    with the department of housing preservation and development as the owner or agent of the premises, at the address filed with such department in compliance with article two of subchapter four of chapter two of title twenty-seven of the administrative

    of the owners, lessors, lessees, mortgagees and all those persons in possession of or having charge of as agent or otherwise, or having any interest in the property, real or personal, used in conducting or maintaining the public nuisance, shall not
    be a defense by such owners, lessors and lessees, mortgagees and such other persons. c. Orders of the police commissioner or such commissioner&#39;s designee issued pursuant to this section shall be posted at the building, erection or place where a public
    nuisance exists or is occurring in violation of law and shall be mailed to the owner of record thereof within one business day of the posting. d. On the fifth business day after the posting of an order issued pursuant to paragraphs one or two of subdivision
    a of this section and upon the written directive of the police commissioner or such commissioner&#39;s designee, officers of the police department are authorized to act upon and enforce such orders. e. Where the police commissioner or such commissioner&#39;s
    designee closes a building, erection or place pursuant to paragraph two of subdivision a of this section, such closing shall be for such period as the police commissioner or such commissioner&#39;s designee may direct but in no event shall the closing
    be for a period of more than one year from the posting of the order pursuant to subdivision c of this section. If the owner, lessor or lessee shall (i) file a bond in an amount determined by the police commissioner or such commissioner&#39;s designee
    but which may not exceed the value of the property ordered to be closed and (ii) submit proof satisfactory to the police commissioner or such commissioner&#39;s designee that the nuisance has been abated and will not be created, maintained or permitted
    for such period of time as the building, erection or place has been directed to be closed by the order of the police commissioner or such commissioner&#39;s designee, then the police commissioner or such commissioner&#39;s designee may vacate the provisions
    of the order that direct the closing of the building, erection or place. f. A closing directed by the police commissioner or such commissioner&#39;s designee pursuant to paragraph two of subdivision a of this section shall not constitute an act of possession,
    ownership or control by the city of the closed premises. g. It shall be a misdemeanor for any person to use or occupy or to permit any other person to use or occupy any building, erection or place, or portion thereof, ordered closed by the police
    commissioner or such commissioner&#39;s designee. Mutilation or removal of a posted order of the police commissioner shall be punishable by a fine of not more than two hundred fifty dollars or by imprisonment not exceeding fifteen days, or both, provided
    such order contains therein a notice of such penalty. h. Intentional disobedience or resistance to any provision of the orders issued by the police commissioner or such commissioner&#39;s designee pursuant to this section, in addition to any other punishment
