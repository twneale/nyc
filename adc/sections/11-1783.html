                    <span class="" style=""><a href='//sections/11-1783.html'>§ 11-1783</a> Limitations on assessment. (a) General. Except as otherwise provided in this section, any tax under this chapter shall be assessed within three years after the return was filed (whether or not such return was filed on or after the date prescribed).
    (b) Time return deemed filed. (1) Early return. For purposes of this section a return of income tax, except withholding tax, filed before the last day prescribed by law or by regulations promulgated pursuant to law for the filing thereof, shall be
    deemed to be filed on such last day. (2) Return of withholding tax. For purposes of this section, if a return of withholding tax for any period ending with or within a calendar year is filed before April fifteenth of the succeeding calendar year,
    such return shall be deemed to be filed on April fifteenth of such succeeding calendar year. (c) Exceptions. (1) Assessment at any time. The tax may be assessed at any time if: (A) no return is filed, (B) a false or fraudulent return is filed with
    intent to evade tax, or (C) the taxpayer or employer fails to comply with <a href='//sections/11-1759.html'>section 11-1759</a>. (2) Extension by agreement. Where, before the expiration of the time prescribed in this section for the assessment of tax, both the tax commission and the taxpayer
    have consented in writing to its assessment after such time, the tax may be assessed at any time prior to the expiration of the period agreed upon. The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration
    of the period previously agreed upon. (3) Report of federal changes, corrections or disallowances. If the taxpayer or employer complies with <a href='//sections/11-1759.html'>section 11-1759</a>, the assessment (if not deemed to have been made upon the filing of the report or amended
    return) may be made at any time within two years after such report or amended return was filed. The amount of such assessment of tax shall not exceed the amount of the increase in city tax attributable to such federal change or correction. The provisions
    of this paragraph shall not affect the time within which or the amount for which an assessment may otherwise be made. (4) Deficiency attributable to net operating loss carryback. If a deficiency is attributable to the application to the taxpayer of
    a net operating loss carryback, it may be assessed at any time that a deficiency for the taxable year of the loss may be assessed. (5) Recovery of erroneous refund. An erroneous refund shall be considered an underpayment of tax on the date made, and
    an assessment of a deficiency arising out of an erroneous refund may be made at any time within two years from the making of the refund, except that the assessment may be made within five years from the making of the refund if it appears that any
    part of the refund was induced by fraud or misrepresentation of a material fact. (6) Request for prompt assessment. If a return is required for a decedent or for a decedent&#39;s estate during the period of administration, the tax shall be assessed within
    eighteen months after written request therefor (made after the return is filed) by the executor, administrator or other person representing the estate of such decedent, but not more than three years after the return was filed, except as otherwise
    provided in this subdivision and subdivision (d) of this section. (7) Report on use of certain property. Under the circumstances described in paragraph two of subdivision (g) of <a href='//sections/11-1712.html'>section 11-1712</a>, the tax may be assessed within three years after the
    filing of a return reporting that property has been used for purposes other than research and development to a greater extent than originally reported. (8) Report concerning waste treatment facility, air pollution control facility or eligible business
    facility. Under the circumstances described in paragraph three of subdivision (h) of <a href='//sections/11-1712.html'>section 11-1712</a> or in paragraph five of subsection (c) of section seven hundred one of the tax law, the tax may be assessed within three years after filing of the
    return containing the information required by such paragraph, or, if a certificate of compliance in respect to an air pollution control facility shall be revoked, within three years after the tax commission shall receive notice of such revocation
    from the taxpayer or as required by section 19-0309 of the environmental conservation law, whichever notice is received earlier. (d) Omission of income, item of tax preference, total taxable amount or ordinary income portion of a lump sum distribution
    on return. The tax may be assessed at any time within six years after the return was filed if: (1) an individual omits from his city adjusted gross income, the sum of his items of tax preference, or the total taxable amount or ordinary income portion
    of a lump sum distribution an amount properly includible therein which is in excess of twenty-five percent of the amount of city adjusted gross income, the sum of the items of tax preference or the total taxable amount or ordinary income portion of
    a lump sum distribution stated in the return, or (2) an estate or trust omits from its city adjusted gross income, the sum of its items of tax preference, or the total taxable amount or ordinary income portion of a lump sum distribution an amount
    properly includible therein which is in excess of twenty-five percent of the amount stated in the return of city adjusted gross income, or the sum of the items of tax preference, or the total taxable amount or ordinary income portion of a lump sum
    distribution, respectively. For purposes of this paragraph, city adjusted gross income means New York adjusted gross income as determined under paragraph four of subsection (e) of section six hundred one of the tax law. For purposes of this subdivision
    there shall not be taken into account any amount which is omitted in the return if such amount is disclosed in the return, or in a statement attached to the return, in a manner adequate to apprise the commissioner of the nature and amount of the item
    of income, tax preference, the total taxable amount or ordinary income portion of a lump sum distribution. (e) Suspension of running of period of limitation. The running of the period of limitations on assessment or collection of tax or other amount
    (or of a transferee&#39;s liability) shall, after the mailing of a notice of deficiency, be suspended for the period during which the tax commission is prohibited under subdivision (c) of <a href='//sections/11-1781.html'>section 11-1781</a> from making the assessment or from collecting by
    levy.</span>
