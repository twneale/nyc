                    <span class="" style=""><a href='//sections/22-262.1.html'>§ 22-262.1</a> Seizure; forfeiture. a. Any police officer or authorized officer or employee of the department may, upon service of a notice of violation or criminal summons upon the owner or operator of a vehicle or other property or equipment, seize such
    vehicle or such other property or equipment which such police officer or authorized officer or employee has reasonable cause to believe is being used in connection with an act constituting a violation of subdivision a of <a href='//sections/22-253.html'>section 22-253</a> of this chapter
    where such vehicle or other property or equipment is owned, leased or rented by a person subject to the provisions of such subdivision or such vehicle or other property or equipment is owned by a person other than an employee and is used directly
    by a person subject to the provisions of such subdivision. Any vehicle, property or equipment seized pursuant to this subdivision shall be delivered into the custody of the department or other appropriate agency. Where a notice of violation has been
    served, a hearing to adjudicate the violation underlying the seizure shall be held before the environmental control board within five business days after the seizure and such board shall render a decision within five business days after the conclusion
    of the hearing. Where a criminal summons has been served, a hearing to adjudicate the violation underlying the seizure shall be held before a court of competent jurisdiction. In the event that such court or the environmental control board determines
    that there has been no violation, the vehicle, property or equipment that was seized shall be released forthwith to the owner or any person authorized by the owner to take possession of such vehicle, property or equipment. b. Except as otherwise provided
    in subdivision a of this section or where notice has been given that forfeiture will be sought pursuant to paragraph (ii) of subdivision e of this section, a vehicle or other property or equipment seized pursuant to subdivision a of this section shall
    be released upon payment of a fine or civil penalty imposed for the violation underlying the seizure and the costs of removal and storage as set forth in the rules of the department. Where an action or a proceeding relating to the violation underlying
    the seizure is pending in a court of competent jurisdiction or an administrative proceeding before the environmental control board, the vehicle or other property or equipment shall be released upon posting of a bond or other form of security sufficient
    to cover the maximum fine or civil penalty which may be imposed for such violation and the costs of removal and storage. c. Where a court of competent jurisdiction or the environmental control board makes a finding that the vehicle or other property
    or equipment has not been used in connection with an act constituting a violation of subdivision a of <a href='//sections/22-253.html'>section 22-253</a> of this chapter, the vehicle or other property or equipment shall be released forthwith to the owner or any person authorized by the
    owner to take possession of such vehicle, property or equipment. d. Any vehicle or other property or equipment that has not been claimed by the owner within ten business days after mailing by first class mail to such owner of notice of a determination
    by a court of competent jurisdiction or by the environmental control board that there has been no violation or that the vehicle or other property or equipment was not used in connection with a violation of subdivision a of <a href='//sections/22-253.html'>section 22-253</a> of this chapter
    shall be deemed by the department to be abandoned. Any vehicle unclaimed under the provisions of this subdivision shall be disposed of by the department pursuant to section twelve hundred twenty-four of the vehicle and traffic law. Property or equipment
    other than a vehicle shall be disposed of by sale at public auction following notice by publication in the city record describing such property or equipment not less than ten business days prior to such sale. Such notice shall provide that the owner
    may reclaim such property or equipment until a date that shall be not sooner than ten business days from the date the notice is published. e. (i) in addition to any other fines, penalties, sanctions or remedies provided for in this chapter, a vehicle
    or other property or equipment which has been seized pursuant to subdivision a of this section and all rights, title and interest therein shall be subject to forfeiture upon notice and judicial determination thereof if the owner of such vehicle or
    other property or equipment has been found liable by a court of competent jurisdiction or the environmental control board on one or more prior occasions for using such vehicle or such other property or equipment in connection with an act constituting
    a violation of subdivision a of <a href='//sections/22-253.html'>section 22-253</a> of this chapter. (ii) A forfeiture proceeding may not be commenced more than ten business days after the receipt of a request by the owner for return of the vehicle, other property or equipment. If a
    forfeiture proceeding is not commenced within such ten day period, the property shall be returned to the owner upon payment of the fine or civil penalty imposed and the costs of removal and storage. A vehicle or other property or equipment which is
    the subject of such action shall remain in the custody of the department or other appropriate agency pending the final determination of the forfeiture action. (iii) Notice of the institution of the forfeiture action shall be served by first class
    mail on: (a) an owner of a vehicle at the address set forth in the records maintained by the department of motor vehicles, or for vehicles not registered in New York state, in the records maintained by the state of registration; (b) all persons holding
    a security interest in such vehicle which security interest has been filed with the department of motor vehicles pursuant to the provisions of title ten of the vehicle and traffic law, at the address set forth in the records of such department, or
    for vehicles not registered in New York state, all persons who hold a security interest in such vehicle which security interest has been filed with such state of registration and which persons are made known by such state to the department at the
    address provided by such state of registration; and (c) for property and equipment other than a vehicle, by publication in the city record describing such property or equipment and by notice served by first class mail to the address of the person
    from whom such property or equipment was seized. Where such person is other than the owner of such property or equipment, notice shall be served by first class mail both to such person and to the owner of such property or equipment where such owner
    is known, or can by reasonable effort, be ascertained or, where such owner is not known or cannot by reasonable effort be ascertained, to the employer of the person from whom the property or other equipment was seized. Notice shall also be served
    by first class mail to any person who holds a security interest in such property or equipment when the name and address of such person has been provided by the owner of the property or equipment or other person from whom the property or equipment
    was seized, or is otherwise known or can, by reasonable effort, be ascertained. (iv) Any owner who receives notice of the institution of a forfeiture action who wishes to claim an interest in the vehicle or other property or equipment subject to forfeiture
    may assert a claim in such action for the recovery of the vehicle or other property or equipment or satisfaction of the owner&#39;s interest in such vehicle or other property or equipment. Any person with a security interest in such vehicle or property
    or equipment who receives notice of the institution of the forfeiture action who claims an interest in such vehicle or other property or equipment may assert a claim in such action for satisfaction of such person&#39;s security interest. (v) Forfeiture
    pursuant to this subdivision shall be made subject to the interest of a person who claims an interest in the vehicle or other property or equipment pursuant to paragraph (iv) of this subdivision, where such person establishes that: (a) the use of
    such vehicle, property or equipment in connection with an act constituting a violation of subdivision a of <a href='//sections/22-253.html'>section 22-253</a> of this chapter that was the basis for seizure occurred without the knowledge of such person, or if such person had knowledge
    of such use, that such person did not consent to such use by failing to do all that could reasonably have been done to prevent such use, and that such person did not knowingly obtain such interest in the vehicle, property or equipment in order to
    avoid the forfeiture; or (b) that the conduct that was the basis for such seizure was committed by any person other than such person claiming an interest in the vehicle, property or equipment while such vehicle was unlawfully in the possession of
    a person who acquired possession thereof in violation of the criminal laws of the United States or any state. (vi) The department, after judicial determination of forfeiture, shall, at its discretion, either: (a) retain such vehicle, property or equipment
    for the official use of the city; or (b) by public notice of at least five days, sell such forfeited vehicle, property or equipment at public sale. The net proceeds of any such sale shall be paid into the general fund of the city. (vii) In any forfeiture
    action commenced pursuant to this subdivision, where the court awards a sum of money to one or more persons in satisfaction of such person&#39;s or persons&#39; interest in the forfeited vehicle, property or equipment, the total amount awarded to satisfy
    such interest or interests shall not exceed the amount of the net proceeds of the sale of the forfeited vehicle, property or equipment after deduction of the lawful expenses incurred by the city, including the reasonable costs of removal and storage
    between the time of seizure and the date of sale. (viii) For purposes of this section, the term &quot;owner&quot; of a vehicle shall mean an owner as defined in section one hundred twenty-eight and in subdivision three of section three hundred eight of the
    vehicle and traffic law. The term &quot;owner&quot; of other property or equipment subject to seizure or forfeiture pursuant to this section shall mean a person who demonstrates ownership of such property or equipment to the satisfaction of the commissioner.
    (ix) For purposes of this section, the term &quot;security interest&quot; in a vehicle shall mean a security interest as defined in subdivision k of section two thousand one hundred one of the vehicle and traffic law. &quot;Security interest&quot; in other property or
    equipment shall mean an interest reserved or created by agreement and which secures payment or performance of an obligation. The term includes the interest of a lessor under a lease intended as security.</span>
