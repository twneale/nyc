Plans for the construction, reconstruction, alteration or demolition of any improvement or proposed improvement which: (1) is owned by the city or is to be constructed upon property owned
    by the city; and (2) is or is to be located on a landmark site or in an historic district or contains an interior landmark; shall, prior to city action approving or otherwise authorizing the use of such plans with respect to securing the performance
    of such work, be referred by the agency of the city having responsibility for the preparation of such plans to the commission for a report. Such report shall be submitted to the mayor, the city council and to the agency having such responsibility
    and shall be published in the City Record within forty-five days after such referral. b. (1) No officer or agency of the city whose approval is required by law for the construction or effectuation of a city-aided project shall approve the plans or
    proposal for, or application for approval of, such project, unless, prior to such approval, such officer or agency has received from the commission a report on such plans, proposal or application for approval. (2) All such plans, proposals or applications
    for approval shall be referred to the commission for a report thereon before consideration of approval thereof is undertaken by any such officer or agency, and the commission shall submit its report to each such officer and agency and such report
    shall be published in the City Record within forty-five days after such referral. c. Except as provided in subdivision d of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/25-303.html'>section 25-303</a>, where the commission so requests, plans for the construction, reconstruction, alteration or demolition of any
    landscape feature of a scenic landmark shall, prior to city action approving or otherwise authorizing the use of such plans with respect to securing the performance of such work, be referred by the agency of the city having responsibility for the
    preparation of such plans to the commission for a report. Such report shall be submitted to the mayor, the city council and to the agency having such responsibility and shall be published in the City Record within forty-five days after such referral.
    No such report shall recommend disapproval of any such plans where land contour work or earthwork is necessary in order to conform with applicable laws concerning regulation of lots, storm water disposal and water courses. The commissioner of parks
    and recreation may request an advisory report concerning work proposed to be performed on, or in the vicinity of, a scenic landmark, and such report shall be published in the City Record. d. In addition to the powers conferred by this chapter, the
    commission shall have the powers specifically conferred upon it by chapter thirty-seven of the charter.</span>
