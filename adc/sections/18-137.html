For purposes of this section, the following terms shall have the following meanings: 1. &quot;Conservancy&quot; shall mean any not-for-profit entity that operates any park or portion of any park under the jurisdiction
    of the commissioner, pursuant to a written conservancy arrangement, provided that &quot;conservancy&quot; shall not include any not-for-profit entity that operates in three or more boroughs. 2. &quot;Conservancy arrangement&quot; shall mean any license or other written
    authorization allowing a conservancy to operate any park or portion of any park under the jurisdiction of the commissioner. 3. &quot;Operates&quot; shall mean the ability to hire a majority of full time staff for such park. 4. &quot;Local representative&quot; shall mean
    an individual who resides within or whose place of business is located within a council district in which such park is located or which such park abuts. b. Any conservancy arrangement entered into, renewed or otherwise granted or executed on or after
    the effective date of the local law that added this section shall require that at least one local representative from each council district where such park is located or which such park abuts be a voting member of the board of directors, or other
    governing body of such conservancy, provided that no more than one local representative from each council district in which such park is located and one local representative from two of the council districts which abut such park shall be required,
    and provided further that no more than twenty percent of the total appointed or elected membership of such conservancy&#39;s board of directors or other governing body shall be required to be local representatives. Such local representatives shall be
    designated in consultation with the council members representing the districts in which the park is located or which abut such park. The nature of such consultation shall be determined by the department, provided that the department shall make the
    designation of each local representative not less than thirty days following its initial consultation with the appropriate council member, during which time the council member may make a written recommendation regarding the local representative to
    be designated from their district. In the event that representation from council districts from which a local representative may be designated would in the aggregate be greater than twenty percent of the total appointed membership of such conservancy&#39;s
    board of directors or other governing body or there are more than two council districts abutting such park, the department may determine which council districts shall be represented initially, in consultation with the appropriate council members,
    with districts from which local representatives shall be designated rotating thereafter in a manner to be determined by the department.</span>
