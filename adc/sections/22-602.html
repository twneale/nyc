(a)(1) Utilities that provide energy services within the city of New York shall be required to make special rebates to eligible energy users and on-site cogenerators certified after June thirtieth,
    two thousand three, other than clean on-site cogenerators, and to make discounts to vendors of energy services and the New York public utility service as follows: (i) a utility that sells energy services to an eligible energy user shall be required
    to make a special rebate to such eligible energy user equal to the product of the applicable percentage specified for special rebates in the schedule contained in paragraph four of this subdivision and the eligible charges for such energy services.
    (ii) a utility that delivers natural gas to an on-site cogenerator, other than a clean on-site cogenerator, that uses such gas to produce electricity used by an eligible energy user, which cogenerator and user are certified after June thirtieth, two
    thousand three, shall be required to make a special rebate to such on-site cogenerator equal to the product of the applicable percentage specified for special rebates in the schedule contained in paragraph four of this subdivision and the eligible
    on-site cogenerator charges for the energy services related to such delivery of such gas. (iii) a utility that sells energy services to a vendor of energy services shall be required to make a discount to such vendor in an amount equal to the sum of
    the special rebates certified to such utility by such vendor as having been made by such vendor to eligible energy users in accordance with subparagraphs (i) through (iii) of paragraph three of this subdivision. (iv) a utility that sells energy services
    to a public utility service shall be required to make a discount to such public utility service in an amount equal to the sum of the special rebates and discounts certified to such utility by such public utility service as having been made by such
    public utility service in accordance with subparagraphs (i) through (iii) of paragraph two of this subdivision. (2) A public utility service providing energy services within the city of New York shall be required to make special rebates to eligible
    energy users and qualified eligible energy users and discounts to vendors of energy services as follows: (i) where, pursuant to a written agreement between a public utility service and the power authority of the state of New York, such public utility
    service sells energy services to an eligible energy user that has been individually approved by such power authority and certified pursuant to subdivision (c) of this section prior to November first, two thousand, such special rebate shall be in the
    amount or amounts derived by calculating the full amount of the special rebate to which such eligible energy user would have been entitled pursuant to the schedule contained in paragraph four of this subdivision for eligible charges relating to the
    purchase of such energy services had such eligible energy user purchased such energy services directly from the utility and subtracting from such full amount the difference between the eligible charges relating to the purchase of such energy services
    had such eligible energy user purchased the energy services directly from the utility and the eligible public utility service charges relating to the purchase of such energy services actually charged to such eligible energy user by such public utility
    service for actual purchases of energy services from such public utility service; except that (A) in no event shall the amount of such special rebate exceed the amount of the special rebate to which such eligible energy user would have been entitled
    pursuant to the schedule contained in paragraph four of this subdivision had such eligible energy user purchased the energy services directly from the utility at the price charged by such utility, and (B) for any monthly billing period where the calculation
    of such special rebate results in a negative number, the amount of such special rebate shall be deemed to be zero. (ii) where, pursuant to a written agreement between a public utility service and the power authority of the state of New York, such
    public utility service (A) sells energy services to an eligible energy user that has been individually approved by such power authority and certified pursuant to subdivision (c) of this section after October thirty-first, two thousand, or (B) sells
    energy services to a qualified eligible energy user that has been individually approved by such power authority and certified pursuant to subdivision (c) of this section prior to November first, two thousand, such special rebate shall be the product
    of the applicable percentage for special rebates specified in the schedule contained in paragraph four of this subdivision and the eligible public utility service charges for such energy services. (iii) a public utility service that sells energy services
    to a vendor of energy services shall be required to make a discount to such vendor of energy services equal to the sum of the special rebates certified to such public utility service by such vendor as having been made by such vendor to eligible energy
    users or qualified eligible energy users to which such vendor of energy services has resold such energy services in accordance with subparagraphs (i) through (iii) of paragraph three of this subdivision. (3) Vendors of energy services may elect to
    provide a special rebate against an eligible energy user&#39;s, qualified eligible energy user&#39;s or on-site cogenerator&#39;s bill for energy services as follows: (i) in the case of a vendor of energy services that sells energy services provided by a utility
    to an eligible energy user, such special rebate shall be the product of the applicable percentage specified for a special rebate in the schedule contained in paragraph four of this subdivision and the eligible charges for such sales of energy services
    made by such vendor of energy services. (ii) in the case of a vendor of energy services that delivers natural gas to an on-site cogenerator that is other than a clean on-site cogenerator and that uses such gas to produce electricity used by an eligible
    energy user, which cogenerator and user are certified after June thirtieth, two thousand three, such special rebate shall be equal to the product of the applicable percentage specified in the schedule contained in paragraph four of this subdivision
    and the eligible on-site cogenerator charges for the energy services related to such delivery of such gas. (iii) in the case of a vendor of energy services that sells energy services provided by a public utility service to a qualified eligible energy
    user that was certified prior to November first, two thousand, or to an eligible energy user that was certified after October thirty-first, two thousand, such special rebate shall be the product of the applicable percentage specified for a special
    rebate in the schedule contained in paragraph four of this subdivision and the eligible public utility service charges for sales of energy services made by such vendor of energy services. (4) For purposes of determining special rebates for energy
    services relating to electricity and natural gas under the provisions of this subdivision, the applicable percentages are as follows: Months Following Applicable % for Applicable % for Certification Natural Gas Electricity first through ninety-sixth
    35% 45% ninety-seventh through 28% 36% one hundred eighth one hundred ninth 21% 27% through one hundred twentieth one hundred twenty-first 14% 18% through one hundred thirty-second one hundred thirty-third 7% 9% through one hundred forty-fourth ;
    provided, however, that the commissioner of the department of small business services may increase such percentages at the commissioner&#39;s discretion in order to maintain the special rebate at levels comparable to those historically provided under
    the program, pursuant to rules that are generally applicable to distinct classes of energy users. (5) A utility that delivers natural gas to an on-site cogenerator that produces electricity for an eligible energy user, which cogenerator and user are
    certified before July first, two thousand three, or to a clean on-site cogenerator that produces electricity for an eligible energy user, shall be required to make special rebates against the energy bill rendered to such on-site cogenerator or clean
    on-site cogenerator by such utility for the sale or delivery, or both, of such gas in the amount or amounts derived by taking the product of a base adjustment multiplied by an eligibility factor, multiplied by the number of kilowatt hours of electricity
    produced by such on-site cogenerator or clean on-site cogenerator and used by such eligible energy user during the billing period, excluding charges for natural gas used to generate electricity used for heating any premises or by any energy user not
    located on the same site, any special charges on such bill, including but not limited to, collection charges, late payment charges, excess distribution charges, and charges for energy which is resold; where the base adjustment shall equal three cents
    increased by nine one-hundredths cent each January first occurring after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred eighty-seven, and ending on June thirtieth, two thousand three, and the eligibility factor shall equal one hundred percent during the
    first eight years after initial certification as an eligible energy user as defined in paragraphs one and two of subdivision (d) of <a href='/adc/sections/22-601.html'>section 22-601</a> of this chapter, eighty percent during the ninth such year, sixty percent during the tenth such year,
    forty percent during the eleventh such year and twenty percent during the twelfth and final such year, such years to be calculated in accordance with the provisions of this section, provided that the number of kilowatt hours on which the total of
    the special rebates payable to a clean on-site cogenerator is based in any year pursuant to this paragraph shall not exceed thirteen million one hundred forty thousand. (6) Notwithstanding any provision of this subdivision, the special rebates and
    discounts provided by the Long Island Power Authority, or its subsidiary, pursuant to this subdivision shall not exceed the amount of the payment made by or on behalf of such authority to the city of New York as a payment that is equivalent to the
    tax imposed by such city pursuant to chapter eleven of title eleven of the code. Special rebates and discounts shall be reduced and/or allocated proportionate to the benefit they would otherwise be eligible for among eligible energy users, public
    utility services, vendors of energy services, and on-site cogenerators where necessary to comply with this paragraph pursuant to rules of the commissioner of the department of small business services. (7) Notwithstanding any provisions of this subdivision,
    special rebates and discounts shall not exceed ten thousand dollars per year per employee or full-time equivalent with respect to applications certified pursuant to this chapter after June thirtieth, two thousand three. (b) Eligible energy users meeting
    the criteria in paragraph one of subdivision (d) and qualified eligible energy users meeting the criteria in paragraph one of subdivision (r) of <a href='/adc/sections/22-601.html'>section 22-601</a> of this chapter shall be eligible for special rebates for a period not to exceed one hundred
    forty-four months calculated from the beginning of the month immediately following their date of certification of eligibility. Eligible energy users meeting the criteria of paragraph two of subdivision (d) of <a href='/adc/sections/22-601.html'>section 22-601</a> of this chapter shall be
    eligible for special rebates for a period calculated from the beginning of the month immediately following their date of certification for so long as they remain in occupancy in the specially eligible premises, but not beyond the period of one hundred
    forty-four months from the beginning of the month immediately following the date of certification of the first eligible energy user occupying such specially eligible premises. The amounts of rebates made to such an eligible energy user meeting the
    criteria of such paragraph two shall be determined in accordance with the schedule contained in paragraph four of subdivision (a) of this section as if such eligible energy user had been certified at the same time as such first eligible energy user
    was certified. A qualified eligible energy user that takes occupancy of targeted eligible premises shall be eligible for special rebates for a period calculated from the beginning of the month immediately following its date of certification as a qualified
    eligible energy user for so long as it remains in occupancy in the targeted eligible premises, but not beyond the period of one hundred forty-four months from the beginning of the month immediately following the date of certification of the first
    qualified eligible energy user occupying such targeted eligible premises. The amounts of rebates made to a qualified eligible energy user that takes occupancy of targeted eligible premises shall be determined in accordance with the schedule contained
    in paragraph four of subdivision (a) of this section as if such qualified eligible energy user had been certified at the same time as such first qualified eligible energy user was certified. An on-site cogenerator or clean on-site cogenerator shall
    be eligible for special rebates for a period not to exceed the period during which the eligible energy user served by such on-site cogenerator or clean on-site cogenerator would have been eligible for a special rebate under the provisions of this
    subdivision had it purchased energy services directly from a utility. (c) (1) No eligible energy user, qualified eligible energy user, on-site cogenerator, clean on-site cogenerator or special eligible energy user shall receive a rebate pursuant to
    this chapter until it has obtained a certification as an eligible energy user, qualified eligible energy user, on-site cogenerator, clean on-site cogenerator or special eligible energy user, respectively, from the commissioner of small business services.
    No such certification for a qualified eligible energy user shall be issued on or after July first, two thousand three. No such certification of any other eligible energy user, on-site cogenerator or clean on-site cogenerator shall be issued on or
    after July first, two thousand thirteen. The commissioner of small business services, after notice and hearing, may revoke a certification issued pursuant to this subdivision where it is found that eligibility criteria have not been met or that compliance
    with conditions for continued eligibility has not been maintained. The corporation counsel may maintain a civil action to recover an amount equal to any benefits improperly obtained. (2) A utility and a vendor of energy services shall keep records
    of all transactions subject to this article and make such records available to the department of small business services. (d) (1) Utilities subject to the provisions of subdivision (a) of this section shall reduce each bill for energy services or
    natural gas for each eligible energy user, vendor of energy services, on-site cogenerator or clean on-site cogenerator as follows: (i) a bill for the sale and delivery of natural gas rendered to an on-site cogenerator or clean on-site cogenerator
    entitled to a special rebate pursuant to the provisions of paragraph five of subdivision (a) of this section shall be reduced by the full amount of the special rebate that shall have accrued for the period covered by each such bill; (ii) a bill for
    energy services rendered to any other eligible energy user or on-site cogenerator shall be reduced by the full amount of the special rebate that shall have accrued for the period covered by each such bill. (iii) a bill for energy services rendered
    to a vendor of energy services that has provided a special rebate to an eligible energy user or on-site cogenerator shall be reduced by such utility in accordance with paragraph three of subdivision (a) of this section by the aggregate amount of all
    such special rebates; (iv) provided, however, such utility shall not be required to provide a special rebate or discount in an amount that exceeds the amount of such bill for the sale and delivery of natural gas rendered to an on-site cogenerator
    or clean on-site cogenerator entitled to a special rebate pursuant to the provisions of paragraph five of subdivision (a) of this section or, in the case of any other eligible energy user or on-site cogenerator, the amount of such bill for energy
    services, and provided, further, that no utility subject to the provisions of subdivision (a) of this section shall be required to carry forward on its books and records any special rebate or discounts not made in accordance with this sentence to
    such bills for subsequent periods. Such discount shall be made within four months from the time certification of special rebates is made in accordance with subparagraph (iii) or (iv) of paragraph one of subdivision (a) of this section. Such amount
    shall be separately stated and shown on each bill. (2) A public utility service that provides special rebates for eligible energy users or qualified eligible energy users shall reduce each bill rendered to each such user by the full amount of the
    special rebate that shall have accrued for the period covered by each such bill in accordance with paragraph two of subdivision (a) of this section. Such amounts shall be separately stated and shown on such bills. (3) Each such vendor of energy services
    that has elected to provide special rebates for eligible energy users, qualified eligible energy users or on-site cogenerators shall reduce each bill rendered to each such energy user or cogenerator by the full amount of the special rebate that shall
    have accrued for the period covered by each such bill in accordance with paragraph three of subdivision (a) of this section. Such amounts shall be separately stated and shown on such bills. (e) The commissioner of small business services shall, for
    the purpose of calculating eligible charges, eligible public utility service charges and eligible on-site cogenerator charges, promulgate rules to determine that portion of such charges that shall be deemed attributable to energy services or natural
    gas used for heating the premises. He or she shall, in addition, promulgate any other rules and regulations necessary to effectuate the purposes of this chapter, including rules to determine the extent to which charges are eligible charges, eligible
    public utility service charges or eligible on-site cogenerator charges and rules to provide for such administrative charges or fees as are necessary to defray expenses in administering the special rebates and discounts provided pursuant to this chapter.</span>
