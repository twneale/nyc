                    <span class="" style=""><a href='//sections/11-811.html'>§ 11-811</a> Refunds. a. In the manner provided in this section the commissioner of finance shall refund or credit, without interest, any tax, penalty or interest erroneously, illegally or unconstitutionally collected or paid, if written application to
    the commissioner of finance for such refund shall be made within one year from the payment thereof. Whenever a refund or credit is made or denied, the commissioner of finance shall state his or her reason therefor and give notice thereof to the taxpayer
    in writing. The commissioner of finance may, in lieu of any refund required to be made, allow credit therefor on payments due from the applicant. b. Any determination of the commissioner of finance denying a refund or credit pursuant to subdivision
    a of this section shall be final and irrevocable unless the applicant for such refund or credit, within ninety days from the mailing or notice of such determination, or, if the commissioner of finance has established a conciliation procedure pursuant
    to <a href='//sections/11-124.html'>section 11-124</a> and the applicant has requested a conciliation conference in accordance therewith, within ninety days from the mailing of a conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner&#39;s confirmation of the discontinuance of the conciliation
    proceeding, both (1) serves a petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2) files a petition with the tax appeals tribunal for a hearing. Such petition for a refund or credit, made as herein provided, shall be deemed an application for a revision
    of any tax, penalty or interest complained of. Such hearing and any appeal to the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc from the decision rendered in such hearing shall be conducted in the manner and subject to the requirements prescribed by the tax
    appeals tribunal pursuant to sections one hundred sixty-eight through one hundred seventy-two of the charter. After such hearing, the tax appeals tribunal shall give notice of its decision to the applicant and to the commissioner of finance. The applicant
    shall be entitled to institute a proceeding pursuant to article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules to review a decision of the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc if application to the supreme court be made therefor within four months
    after the giving of notice of such decision, and provided, in the case of an application by a taxpayer, that a final determination of tax due was not previously made. Such a proceeding shall not be instituted by a taxpayer, unless an undertaking shall
    first be filed with the commissioner of finance in such amount and with such sureties as a justice of the supreme court shall approve, to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the taxpayer will pay all costs and charges
    which may accrue in the prosecution of the proceeding. c. A person shall not be entitled to a revision, refund or credit under this section of a tax, interest or penalty which had been determined to be due pursuant to the provisions of <a href='//sections/11-810.html'>section 11-810</a>
    of this chapter where such person has had a hearing or an opportunity for a hearing, as provided in said section, or has failed to avail himself or herself of the remedies therein provided. No refund or credit shall be made of a tax, interest or penalty
    paid after a determination by the commissioner of finance made pursuant to <a href='//sections/11-810.html'>section 11-810</a> of this chapter unless it be found that such determination was erroneous, illegal or unconstitutional or otherwise improper, by the tax appeals tribunal after
    a hearing or on the commissioner&#39;s own motion, or, if such tax appeals tribunal affirms in whole or in part the determination of the commissioner of finance, in a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules, pursuant
    to the provisions of said section, in which event refund or credit without interest shall be made of the tax, interest or penalty found to have been overpaid.</span>
