The administering agency shall develop a protocol for notification to organizations such as media organizations, senior service providers, medical facilities and community organizations when a silver alert is issued. b. The administering
    agency shall, as appropriate, consult with other city agencies, including, but not limited to, the police department, the fire department, the office of emergency management, the human resources administration, the department for the aging, the department
    of health and mental hygiene and the department of transportation, to collect and disseminate information regarding the person for whom the silver alert was issued. c. The administering agency shall issue a silver alert within twenty-four hours of
    the determination that a vulnerable senior has been reported missing under circumstances indicating that the person is in imminent danger of serious bodily harm or death. The silver alert may be issued by any appropriate means, including, but not
    limited to, email notifications, text messages, telephone calls, television broadcasts or radio broadcasts. The silver alert may be issued at repeated intervals within the discretion of the administering agency until such missing person is found or
    until the administering agency determines that the issuance of a silver alert is no longer appropriate. d. The information about the person for whom the silver alert was issued, if available and capable of transmission, shall include, but not be limited
    to: (1) the person&#39;s name; (2) the person&#39;s age; (3) a physical description of the person; (4) the last known location where the person was seen, which shall not include the exact address of the person&#39;s home; (5) a recent photograph of the person;
    and (6) a description of any motor vehicle the person may have been driving, provided that the administering agency may refrain from disclosing any such information if disclosure is inappropriate under the circumstances. e. The administering agency
    may use its discretion to issue a silver alert for a person under the age of 65 who is reported missing under circumstances indicating that the person is in imminent danger of serious bodily harm or death, where such missing person has dementia, as
    a result of Alzheimer&#39;s disease or a similar condition.</span>
