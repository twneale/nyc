                    <span class="" style="">* <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/21-503.html'>§ 21-503</a> Grievance Procedure. a. The following procedure shall be established in order to allow for the timely resolution of grievances. A participant may elect to pursue a grievance pursuant to this chapter prior to the initiation of conciliation
    under § 341 of New York State social services law. The sponsoring agency shall notify each participant orally and in writing at the start of each work assignment of the participant&#39;s rights and responsibilities under this procedure, including the
    right to resolve grievances under such procedure prior to the initiation of conciliation under § 341 of New York State social services law, and of the name, work address, telephone number of and locations to submit a grievance to the participant&#39;s
    Step 1 supervisor and the sponsoring agency WEP coordinator. The sponsoring agency shall not notify the office of employment services (&quot;OES&quot;) or any other designee of the local social services district of an alleged failure to comply with program
    or work activities requirements by the participant unless and until the Step 1 supervisor or a higher-level supervisor first notifies the participant orally and in writing that the agency intends to do so and why, and then only after completion of
    the procedure set forth in Steps 1 and 2. In the event there is an alleged failure by a participant to comply with a program or work activity requirement and no grievance is submitted during the time period set forth below, then the sponsoring agency
    may notify OES. Nothing herein shall limit the authority of the sponsoring agencies except as provided herein. b. General Procedure. i. Step 1. A participant&#39;s grievance shall be made verbally or in writing to his or her step 1 supervisor not later
    than five (5) working days after the act or omission complained of. Discussion and consideration of the grievance may be assisted by a higher level supervisor(s), who may be called in to help with the resolution process. The participant and the supervisor(s)
    shall work together to resolve the dispute to the satisfaction of both the participants and the sponsoring agency. The grievance shall be considered and passed upon in writing within five (5) working days after it has been presented to the participant&#39;s
    step 1 supervisor. A copy of the written decision shall be given to the participant. ii. Step 2. If a grievance is not resolved at step 1 to the satisfaction of the participant, within seven (7) working days after the participant has received a copy
    of the written decision rendered in step 1, the participant may appeal the initial decision verbally or in writing by requesting a discussion of the grievance with the sponsoring agency WEP coordinator. The participant and the sponsoring agency WEP
    coordinator shall work jointly for a mutually satisfactory resolution of the grievance. The appeal shall be considered and passed upon in writing within three (3) working days after the appeal has been made. A copy of the determination of the appeal
    shall be given to the participant. iii. Step 3. If a grievance is not resolved at step 2 to the satisfaction of the participant, the participant may appeal the decision verbally or in writing to the social services district pursuant to social services
    law § 341. c. A participant grieving a work assignment or working conditions shall continue to work at their assigned sponsoring agency. If the grievance involves a claim that the assignment or condition is injurious to the participant&#39;s health or
    safety or that it exceeds his/her medical limitations, the sponsoring agency shall reassign the participant to a different work assignment that is not injurious to the participant&#39;s health or safety or claimed medical limitations. d. At any stage
    of the grievance procedure established by this chapter, a participant shall have the right to representation by legal counsel, or by a relative, friend, or other spokesperson, or may represent him or herself. * NB The validity of local law 13 of 2000
    is currently a subject of disagreement between the Mayor and the City Council. This certification is not intended as a legal opinion as to the validity of the local law, other than certifying the truth of the facts presented herein.</span>
