                    <span class="" style=""><a href='//sections/10-311.html'>§ 10-311</a> Sale of weapons without safety locking device prohibited. a. It shall be unlawful for any person or business enterprise to dispose of any weapon which does not contain a safety locking device. For the purposes of this section and <a href='//sections/10-312.html'>section 10-312</a>:
    (1) weapon shall mean a firearm, rifle, shotgun, or assault weapon, as such terms are defined in <a href='//sections/10-301.html'>section 10-301</a>; or a machine gun, as defined in the penal law; and (2) a safety locking device shall mean a design adaptation or attachable accessory
    that will prevent the use of the weapon by an unauthorized user, and includes, but is not limited to, a trigger lock, which prevents the pulling of the trigger without the use of a key, or a combination handle, which prevents the use of the weapon
    without the alignment of the combination tumblers. b. It shall be unlawful for any licensed manufacturer, licensed importer, or licensed dealer to dispose of any weapon in the city of New York unless it is accompanied by the following warning, which
    shall appear in conspicuous and legible type in capital letters, and which shall be printed on a label affixed to the weapon and on a separate sheet of paper included within the packaging enclosing the weapon: &quot;THE USE OF A LOCKING DEVICE OR SAFETY
    LOCK IS ONLY ONE ASPECT OF RESPONSIBLE WEAPON STORAGE. ALL WEAPONS SHOULD BE STORED UNLOADED AND LOCKED IN A LOCATION THAT IS BOTH SEPARATE FROM THEIR AMMUNITION AND INACCESSIBLE TO CHILDREN AND ANY OTHER UNAUTHORIZED PERSONS. NEW YORK CITY LAW PROHIBITS,
    WITH CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, ANY PERSON FROM ACQUIRING MORE THAN ONE FIREARM, OR MORE THAN ONE RIFLE OR SHOTGUN, WITHIN A 90-DAY PERIOD.&quot; c. Any person who applies for and obtains authorization to purchase a weapon or otherwise lawfully obtains a weapon
    pursuant to chapters one or three of title ten of this code shall be required to purchase or obtain a safety locking device at the time he or she purchases or obtains the weapon. d. (1) The police commissioner is authorized to promulgate rules setting
    forth the types of safety locking devices which will comply with this section in accordance with subdivision a of this section. The city of New York and its agencies, officers or employees shall not be liable to any party by reason of any incident
    involving, or the use or misuse of, a safety locking device that may have been purchased in compliance with such rules promulgated by the commissioner. (2) The police commissioner shall provide written notice of the requirements of this section and
    <a href='//sections/10-312.html'>section 10-312</a> to all persons who receive an official authorization to purchase a weapon and all persons applying for renewal of a license or permit issued pursuant to chapters one or three of title ten, including any rules promulgated under this
    subdivision. All persons applying for a license or permit or applying for the renewal of a license or permit pursuant to chapters one or three of title ten of this code, shall receive from the commissioner information concerning the importance of
    using a safety locking device while a weapon is not in use, and a warning that weapons should be stored unloaded and locked in a location that is both separate from their ammunition and inaccessible to children and any other unauthorized persons.
    e. Any violation of subdivisions a or b of this section or any rule promulgated thereunder shall be a misdemeanor and triable by a judge of the criminal court of the city of New York and punishable by imprisonment of not more than thirty days or by
    a fine of not more than five hundred dollars, or both.</span>
