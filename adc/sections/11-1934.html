                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-1934.html'>§ 11-1934</a> Collection, levy and liens. (a) Collection procedures. The taxes imposed by this chapter shall be collected by the commissioner, and he or she may establish the mode or time for the collection of any amount due the commissioner under this
    chapter if not otherwise specified. The commissioner shall, upon request, give a receipt for any sum collected under this chapter. The commissioner may authorize banks or trust companies which are depositories or financial agents of the city to receive
    and give a receipt for any tax imposed under this chapter in such manner, at such times, and under such conditions as the commissioner may prescribe; and the commissioner shall prescribe the manner, times and conditions under which the receipt of
    such tax by such banks and trust companies is to be treated as payment of such tax to the commissioner. (b) Notice and demand for tax. The commissioner shall as soon as practicable and, in the case of an assessment the collection of which is restricted
    by the provisions of subdivision (c) of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-1923.html'>section 11-1923</a> of this subchapter, as soon as practicable after the expiration of such restrictions give notice to each person liable for any amount of tax, addition to tax, penalty or interest, which has been
    assessed but remains unpaid, stating the amount and demanding payment thereof. Such notice shall be left at the dwelling or usual place of business of such person or shall be sent by mail to such person&#39;s last known address. Except where the commissioner
    determines that collection would be jeopardized by delay, if any tax is assessed prior to the last date (including any date fixed by extension) prescribed for payment of such tax, payment of such tax shall not be demanded until after such date. (c)
    Issuance of warrant after notice and demand. If any person liable under this chapter for the payment of any tax, addition to tax, penalty or interest neglects or refuses to pay the same within ten days after notice and demand therefor is given to
    such person under subdivision (b) of this section, the commissioner may within six years after the date of the expiration of the period of restriction on the collection of such assessment issue a warrant directed to the sheriff of any county of the
    state, or to any officer or employee of the department of finance of the city, commanding the sheriff or such officer or employee to levy upon and sell such person&#39;s real and personal property for the payment of the amount assessed, with the cost
    of executing the warrant, and to return such warrant to the commissioner and pay to him or her the money collected by virtue thereof within sixty days after the receipt of the warrant. If the commissioner finds that the collection of tax or other
    amount is in jeopardy, notice and demand for immediate payment of such tax may be made by the commissioner and upon failure or refusal to pay such tax or other amount the commissioner may issue a warrant without regard to the ten-day period provided
    in this subdivision. (d) Copy of warrant to be filed and lien to be created. Any sheriff or officer or employee who receives a warrant under subdivision (c) of this section shall within five days thereafter file a copy with the clerk of the appropriate
    county. The clerk shall thereupon enter in the judgment docket, in the column for judgment debtors, the name of the taxpayer mentioned in the warrant, and in appropriate columns the tax or other amounts for which the warrant is issued and the date
    when such copy is filed; and such amount shall thereupon be a binding lien upon the real, personal and other property of the taxpayer. (e) Judgment. When a warrant has been filed with the county clerk the commissioner shall, on behalf of the city,
    be deemed to have obtained judgment against the taxpayer for the tax or other amounts. (f) Execution. The sheriff or officer or employee shall thereupon proceed upon the judgment in all respects, with like effect, and in the same manner prescribed
    by law in respect to executions issued against property upon judgments of a court of record, and a sheriff shall be entitled to the same fees for such sheriff&#39;s services in executing the warrant, to be collected in the same manner. An officer or employee
    of the department of finance of the city may proceed in any county or counties of this state and shall have all the powers of execution conferred by law upon sheriffs, but shall be entitled to no fee or compensation in excess of actual expenses paid
    in connection with the execution of the warrant. (g) Taxpayer not then a resident. Where a notice and demand under subdivision (b) shall have been given to a taxpayer who is not then a resident of this state, and it appears to the commissioner that
    it is not practicable to find in this state property of the taxpayer sufficient to pay the entire balance of tax or other amount owing by such taxpayer who is not then a resident of this state, the commissioner may, in accordance with subdivision
    (c) of this section, issue a warrant directed to an officer or employee of the department of finance of the city a copy of which warrant shall be mailed by certified or registered mail to the taxpayer at his or her last known address, subject to the
    rules for mailing provided in subdivision (a) of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-1933.html'>section 11-1933</a> of this subchapter. Such warrant shall command the officer or employee to proceed in the city, and such officer or employee shall, within five days after receipt of the warrant, file
    the warrant and obtain a judgment in accordance with this section. Thereupon the commissioner may authorize the institution of any action or proceeding to collect or enforce the judgment in any place and by any procedure where and by which a civil
    judgment of the supreme court of the state of New York could be collected or enforced. The commissioner may also, in his or her discretion, designate agents or retain counsel for the purpose of collecting, outside the state of New York, any unpaid
    taxes, additions to tax, penalties or interest which have been assessed under this chapter against taxpayers who are not then residents of this state, may fix the compensation of such agents and counsel to be paid out of money appropriated or otherwise
    lawfully available for payment thereof, and may require of them bonds or other security for the faithful performance of their duties, in such form and in such amount as the commissioner shall deem proper and sufficient. (h) Action by the city for
    recovery of taxes. Action may be brought by the corporation counsel or other appropriate officer of the city at the insistance of the commissioner to recover the amount of any unpaid taxes, additions to tax, penalties or interest which have been assessed
    under this chapter within six years prior to the date the action is commenced. The period during which collection of any assessment is prohibited by subdivision (c) of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-1923.html'>section 11-1923</a> of this subchapter, shall be added to such six years. (i) Release
    of lien. The commissioner, if he or she finds that the interest of the city will not thereby be jeopardized, and upon such conditions as may require, may release any property from the lien of any warrant for unpaid taxes, additions to tax, penalties
    and interest filed pursuant to this section, and such release may be recorded in the office of any recording officer in which such warrant has been filed.</span>
