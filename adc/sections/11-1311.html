                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-1311.html'>§ 11-1311</a> Refunds. a. In the manner provided in this subdivision the commissioner of finance shall refund, without interest, any tax, interest or penalty erroneously, illegally or unconstitutionally collected or paid. In addition, whenever any cigarettes
    upon which stamps have been affixed have been sold and shipped to a dealer outside the city for sale there or to any person in another state for use there, or have become unfit for use and consumption or unsalable, or have been destroyed, the dealer
    shall be entitled to a refund of the amount of tax paid, less the applicable commission, with respect to such cigarettes. In any event no refund shall be granted unless application to the commissioner of finance therefor is made within two years after
    the stamps were affixed to such cigarettes or the tax was paid, except if a person has consented in writing to an extension of the period for assessment of additional tax pursuant to subdivision c of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-1315.html'>section 11-1315</a> of this chapter, and such consent
    is given within the two-year period for making a refund application provided in this subdivision, the period for making a refund application shall not expire prior to six months after the expiration of the period within which an assessment could be
    made pursuant to such consent or any extension thereof. Whenever a refund is made or denied by the commissioner of finance, the commissioner shall state his or her reasons therefor and give notice thereof to the applicant in writing. A person shall
    not be entitled to a hearing in connection with such application for a refund if such person has already had a hearing or had been given the opportunity of a hearing as provided in <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-1310.html'>section 11-1310</a> of this chapter or has failed to avail himself or
    herself of the remedies therein provided. No refund shall be made of a tax, interest or penalty paid pursuant to a determination of the commissioner of finance as provided in <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-1310.html'>section 11-1310</a> of this chapter, unless the tax appeals tribunal, after
    a hearing as in said section provided or the commissioner of finance, of his or her own motion, shall have reduced the tax or penalty, or it shall have been established in a proceeding, pursuant to article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and
    rules that such determination was erroneous, illegal, unconstitutional or otherwise improper, in which event a refund without interest shall be made as provided upon the determination of such proceeding. Any determination of the commissioner of finance
    denying a refund pursuant to this subdivision shall be final and irrevocable unless the applicant for such refund, within ninety days from the mailing of notice of such determination, or, if the commissioner of finance has established a conciliation
    procedure pursuant to <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-124.html'>section 11-124</a> of this title and the applicant has requested a conciliation conference in accordance therewith, within ninety days from the mailing of a conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner&#39;s confirmation of
    the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding, both (1) serves a petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2) files a petition with the tax appeals tribunal for a hearing. Such petition for a refund made as provided in this subdivision shall
    be deemed an application for a revision of any tax, penalty or interest complained of. Such hearing and any appeal to the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc from the decision rendered in such hearing shall be conducted in the manner and subject
    to the requirements prescribed by the tax appeals tribunal pursuant to sections one hundred sixty-eight through one hundred seventy-two of the charter. After such hearing, the tax appeals tribunal shall give notice of its decision to the applicant
    and to the commissioner of finance. The applicant shall be entitled to maintain a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules to review a decision of the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc, provided, however, that
    such proceeding is instituted within four months after such decision, and provided, further, in the case of an application by a person liable for the tax, that a final determination of tax due was not previously made, and that an undertaking shall
    first be filed by such person with the commissioner of finance in such amount and with such sureties as a justice of the supreme court shall approve, to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed such person will pay all
    costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding. b. If the commissioner of finance is satisfied that any dealer is entitled to a refund the commissioner shall issue to such dealer stamps of sufficient value to cover the refund
    or to make such refund.</span>
