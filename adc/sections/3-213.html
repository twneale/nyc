(a) (1) Every lobbyist shall annually file with the city clerk, on forms prescribed by the city clerk, a statement of registration for each calendar year, provided, however, that the filing of such statement of registration
    shall not be required of any lobbyist who in any year does not earn or incur an amount in excess of five thousand dollars or, if the lobbyist is an architect or engineer, or an architecture or engineering firm, ten thousand dollars, of combined reportable
    compensation and expenses, as provided in paragraph five of subdivision (b) of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/3-216.html'>section 3-216</a> of this subchapter, for the purposes of lobbying. (2) Such filing shall be completed on or before January fifteenth by those persons who have been retained,
    employed or designated as lobbyists on or before December thirty-first of the previous calendar year who reasonably anticipate that in the coming year they will earn or incur combined reportable compensation and expenses in an amount in excess of
    five thousand dollars or, if the lobbyist is an architect or engineer, or an architecture or engineering firm, ten thousand dollars. For those lobbyists retained, employed or designated after December thirty-first, and for those lobbyists who, subsequent
    to their retainer, employment or designation, reasonably anticipate combined reportable compensation and expenses in excess of such amount, such filing must be completed within fifteen days thereafter. (3) Before a lobbyist files a statement of registration
    pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision, the lobbyist and its client shall enroll in the electronic filing system. (b) Such statements of registration shall be kept in electronic form in the office of the city clerk and shall be available for
    public inspection. (c) Such statement of registration shall contain: (1) the name, home and business addresses and business telephone number of the lobbyist and the name and home and business addresses of the spouse or domestic partner of the lobbyist,
    and if the lobbyist is an organization the name, home and business addresses and business telephone number of any officer or employee of such lobbyist who engages in any lobbying activities or who is employed in an organization&#39;s division that engages
    in lobbying activities of the organization and the name and home and business addresses of the spouse or domestic partner of such officers or employees, provided that, notwithstanding any provision of this subchapter to the contrary, the home address
    of the lobbyist, including, if the lobbyist is an organization, the home address of any officer or employee of such lobbyist who engages in any lobbying activities or who is employed in an organization&#39;s division that engages in lobbying activities
    of the organization, and the names and home and business addresses of spouses and domestic partners of such lobbyists, officers and employees, whether contained in an original or amended statement of registration, shall not be made available to the
    public, but may be accessed by the campaign finance board for the sole purpose of determining whether a campaign contribution is matchable pursuant to <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/3-702.html'>section 3-702</a> of the New York City campaign finance act; provided, however, that notwithstanding
    any other provision of law, in making information on campaign contributions publicly available, the campaign finance board shall not disclose that any specific contributor is the spouse, domestic partner or unemancipated child of such a lobbyist,
    officer or employee; (2) the name, address and telephone number of the client by whom or on whose behalf the lobbyist is retained, employed or designated; (3) if such lobbyist is retained or employed pursuant to a written agreement of retainer or
    employment, a copy of such shall also be attached and if such retainer or employment is oral, a statement of the substance thereof; (4) a written authorization from the client by whom the lobbyist is authorized to lobby, unless such lobbyist has filed
    a written agreement of retainer or employment pursuant to paragraph three of this subdivision; (5) a description of the subject or subjects on which the lobbyist is lobbying or expects to lobby, including information sufficient to identify the local
    law or resolution, procurement, real property, rule, rate making proceeding, determination of a board or commission, or other matter on which the lobbyist is lobbying or expects to lobby; * (6) the name of the person or agency before which the lobbyist
    is lobbying or expects to lobby; * NB Effective until May 16, 2014 * (6) the names of the persons and agencies before which the lobbyist has lobbied or expects to lobby; * NB Effective May 16, 2014 (7) if the lobbyist has a financial interest in the
    client, direct or indirect, information as to the extent of such interest and the date on which it was acquired; and * (8) if the lobbyist is retained, employed or designated by more than one client, a separate statement of registration shall be required
    for each such client. * NB Effective May 16, 2014 (d) * (1) Whenever there is a change in the information filed by the lobbyist in the original statement of registration, an amended statement shall be submitted to the city clerk on forms prescribed
    by the city clerk within ten days after such change occurs, except as provided in paragraph two of this subdivision; however, this shall not require the lobbyist to amend the entire registration form. * NB Effective until May 16, 2014 * (1) Whenever
    there is a change in the information filed by the lobbyist in the statement of registration, other than a change to information submitted pursuant to paragraphs five and six of subdivision (c) of this section, an amended statement shall be submitted
    to the city clerk on forms prescribed by the city clerk within ten days after such change occurs, except as provided in paragraph two of this subdivision. * NB Effective May 16, 2014 (2) Whenever a contribution, as defined in subdivision eight of
    <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/3-702.html'>section 3-702</a> of the New York City campaign finance act, is made by the unemancipated child of a lobbyist or by the unemancipated child of the spouse or domestic partner of a lobbyist or, if the lobbyist is an organization, by the unemancipated child
    of any officer or employee of such lobbyist who engages in lobbying activities or who is employed in an organization&#39;s division that engages in lobbying activities of the organization or by the unemancipated child of the spouse or domestic partner
    of any such officer or employee, in the calendar year for which a statement of registration is filed, the lobbyist shall file an amended statement of registration within forty-eight hours of the making of such contribution. Such amended statement
    of registration shall contain the name and the home address of such unemancipated child and the home and business addresses of the unemancipated child&#39;s parent, if such parent&#39;s home and business addresses were reported pursuant to paragraph one of
    subdivision (c) of this section. Such amendment shall not require the lobbyist to amend the entire registration form. If such contribution was made in the calendar year for which a statement of registration is filed, but before the filing of such
    statement of registration, then the original statement of registration shall contain the name and the home address of such unemancipated child and the home and business addresses of the unemancipated child&#39;s parent, if such parent&#39;s home and business
    addresses were reported pursuant to paragraph one of subdivision (c) of this section. Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, the names and addresses of unemancipated children shall not be made available to the public, but may
    be accessed by the campaign finance board for the sole purpose of determining whether a campaign contribution is matchable pursuant to such <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/3-702.html'>section 3-702</a>; provided, however, that notwithstanding any other provision of law, in making information on
    campaign contributions publicly available, the campaign finance board shall not disclose that any specific contributor is the spouse, domestic partner or unemancipated child of such a lobbyist, officer or employee. For purposes of this paragraph,
    the term &quot;unemancipated child&quot; shall mean any son, daughter, stepson or stepdaughter who is under age eighteen, unmarried and living in the household of such lobbyist or spouse or domestic partner of such lobbyist or, if such lobbyist is an organization,
    living in the household of such officer or employee or spouse or domestic partner of such officer or employee. (e) Each statement of registration filed annually by each lobbyist shall be accompanied by a registration fee of one hundred fifty dollars.
    An additional fee may be imposed not to exceed fifty dollars for each client in excess of one identified on such statement. (f) In the event of the retention, employment or designation of an organization wherein more than one member of the organization
    will be engaging in lobbying activities on behalf of a client, one statement of registration shall be filed by the organization with a listing of all such persons. *(g) If the city clerk grants an extension allowing a lobbyist to file a statement
    of registration later than the deadline contained in paragraph two of subdivision (a) of this section, the city clerk shall forward notice of such extension no later than the end of the following business day to the mayor&#39;s office of contract services
    for inclusion in the &quot;doing business database&quot; as defined in subdivision twenty of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/3-702.html'>section 3-702</a> of the code. * NB Effective May 16, 2014</span>
