                    <span class="" style=""><a href='//sections/11-1304.html'>§ 11-1304</a> Preparation and sale of stamps; commissions. a. The commissioner of finance shall, subject to the approval of the state tax commission, prescribe, prepare and furnish stamps of such denominations and quantities as may be necessary for the
    payment of the tax imposed by this chapter, and may, from time to time, provide for the issuance and exclusive use of stamps of a new design and forbid the use of stamps of any other design. Such stamps shall be in the form of a single stamp for the
    payment of the tax imposed by this chapter or, in lieu thereof, a joint single stamp to be prepared and issued by the state of New York and the city for the payment of the tax imposed by this chapter and the taxes imposed by article twenty of the
    tax law. The commissioner of finance may make such arrangements with the state tax commission for the method of acquiring and the manner of sharing the costs of such joint single stamps as he or she deems appropriate. The commissioner of finance,
    subject to the approval of the state tax commission, shall make provisions for the sale of such stamps at such places as he or she may deem necessary, and may appoint fiscal agents for such purpose. b. The commissioner of finance may appoint wholesale
    dealers of cigarettes and any other person within or without the city as agents to affix stamps to be used in paying the tax hereby imposed, but an agent shall at all times have the right to appoint the person in his or her employ who is to affix
    the stamps to any cigarettes under the agent&#39;s control. Whenever the commissioner of finance shall sell, consign or deliver to any such agent any such stamps, such agent shall be entitled to receive as compensation for his or her services and expenses
    in affixing such stamps, and to retain out of the moneys to be paid by the agent for such stamps, a commission on the par value thereof. The commissioner of finance is hereby authorized to prescribe a schedule of commissions not exceeding five per
    centum, allowable to such agent for affixing such stamps; provided, however, that the commissioner of finance may authorize commissions to agents and temporary agents not exceeding ten per centum for a special period not exceeding fifteen days immediately
    following the enactment of this chapter to cover the initial stamping of packages of cigarettes. Such schedule shall be uniform for each type and denomination of stamp used, and may be on a graduated scale with respect to the number of stamps purchased.
    In the event that a joint stamp is issued, the commissions allowed shall be determined jointly by the state tax commission and the commissioner of finance and shall be based on the full par value of such stamp. The extent to which the city and the
    state of New York shall bear the expense of such commissions shall be determined by agreement between the state tax commission and the commissioner of finance. The commissioner of finance may in his or her discretion permit an agent to pay for such
    stamps within thirty days after the date of sale, consignment or delivery of such stamps to such agents, and may require any such agent to file with the commissioner of finance a bond, issued by a surety company approved by the superintendent of insurance
    as to solvency and responsibility and authorized to transact business in the state, in such amounts as the commissioner of finance may fix, to secure the payment of any sums from such agent pursuant to this chapter. c. The commissioner of finance
    may redeem unused stamps lawfully in the possession of any person. No person shall sell or offer for sale any stamp issued under this chapter, except by written permission of the commissioner of finance. The commissioner of finance may prescribe rules
    and regulations concerning refunds, sales of stamps and redemptions under the provisions of this chapter. d. (1) Except as provided in this subdivision, it shall be unlawful for any person to sell, offer for sale, possess or transport any affixed
    or unaffixed false, altered or counterfeit cigarette tax stamps, imprints or impressions. (2) Paragraph one of this subdivision shall not apply to: (A) a person, other than a retail dealer, in possession of twenty or fewer affixed tax stamps; (B)
    public officers or employees in the performance of their official duties requiring possession or control of affixed or unaffixed false, altered or counterfeit cigarette tax stamps, imprints or impressions; or (C) any person authorized by the commissioner
    of finance or the commissioner of the department of taxation and finance of the state of New York to perform law enforcement functions.</span>
