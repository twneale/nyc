    such access to and eligibility for benefits and services shall not be more restrictive than those requirements mandated by state or federal statute, law, regulation or rule. Within thirty days of the effective date of the local law that added this
    section, the commissioner shall establish criteria pursuant to which an applicant shall be entitled to a home or hospital visit for the purpose of establishing eligibility and applying for benefits and services. c. 1. Upon written or oral application

    which shall include, but not be limited to, the date, a description of the information received, and a statement as to whether any application for such benefits and services is complete or incomplete, and if incomplete, such receipt shall identify
    any information or documents needed in order for the application to be deemed complete. 2. Processing of applications for medically appropriate non-emergency housing. (a) Unless the client shall decline, the division shall provide the following to
    every homeless client of the division on the day the client is determined to be eligible for services as a client of the division: (i) an application for medically appropriate non-emergency housing; and (ii) information regarding financial assistance

    the client for the application for non-emergency housing, whichever is sooner, the division must provide every client who is eligible for non-emergency housing a referral to an available medically appropriate non-emergency housing option, which takes
    into consideration the medical, educational and familial needs and social circumstances of the client, to the extent such option is available. (d) For any client who remains homeless or in emergency housing for over 45 days after the requirements
    of subparagraph (c) of this paragraph or the requirements of this subparagraph have been met, the division shall provide a referral to another medically appropriate non-emergency housing option, to the extent such option is available. 3. Where no
    statute, law, regulation or rule provides a time period within which a benefit or service shall be provided to an eligible person who requests such a benefit or service, such benefit or service shall be provided no later than twenty business days
    following submission of all information or documentation required to determine eligibility. d. Where a person with clinical/symptomatic HIV illness or with AIDS who applies for benefits and services, or access to benefits and services, indicates that
    one or more minor children reside with him or her or are in his or her care or custody, such person shall be given information and program referrals on child care options and custody planning, including the availability of standby guardianship pursuant

    satisfy eligibility requirements, is deceased, or upon certification by the commissioner that the recipient cannot be located to verify his or her continued eligibility for benefits and services. In the latter circumstance, the division shall conduct
    a reasonable good faith search for at least a ninety-day period to locate the recipient, including sending written notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the last known address of such recipient, requiring the recipient to contact
    the division within ten days. g. Not later than sixty days from the effective date of the local law that added this section, the commissioner shall prepare a draft policy and procedures manual for division staff. Such policy and procedures manual
    shall include, but not be limited to, strict guidelines on maintaining the confidentiality of the identity of and information relating to all applicants and recipients, instructional materials relating to the medical and psychological needs of persons
    with clinical/symptomatic HIV illness or with AIDS, application procedures, eligibility standards, mandated time periods for the provision of each benefit and service available to applicants and recipients and advocacy resources available to persons

    for HIV, and any other member of the public shall be given an opportunity to comment on such draft bill of rights. The commissioner shall publish a final rule within thirty days after the conclusion of such hearing and shall thereafter review, and
    where appropriate, revise such bill of rights on an annual basis. Such bill of rights shall be conspicuously posted in all division offices that are open to the public and shall be available for distribution to the public in English, Spanish and any
