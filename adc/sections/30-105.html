                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/nyc/adc/sections/30-105.html'>§ 30-105</a> Sheltering plan. The commissioner, in consultation with relevant federal, state and local agencies, shall develop or update a sheltering plan no later than December first, two thousand thirteen, that anticipates the operation of shelters for
    short, medium or long-term periods of time as a result of coastal storms and other severe weather and natural disaster events. Such plan shall include, but not be limited to the following features, provided that nothing herein shall be construed to
    interfere with the ability of agencies responding to an emergency to implement plans, modify plans, or take steps not described in any written plan, in a manner appropriate to circumstances particular to that emergency: a. a description of the types
    of evacuation centers and shelters, number and location of evacuation centers, how persons are transferred from an evacuation center to a shelter, and a mechanism to identify locations to be used as shelters, including shelters that are adequate for
    habitability for long-term stays; b. a description of shelter staffing and management, including but not limited to an explanation of how key shelter staff positions such as shelter managers and clinical staff will be determined and how shelters will
    be adequately staffed with trained medical personnel to the extent necessary for each such shelter&#39;s needs; c. a mechanism for clearly identifying to residents, volunteers and other staff at each shelter the individuals filling key staff positions
    at such shelter; d. a mechanism to provide that to the extent practicable any shelter manager coordinates with a shelter manager on the immediately following shift at such shelter regarding requests for supplies, shelter conditions and other significant
    issues at such shelter; e. a mechanism to provide that there is adequate food and water at every shelter and that food options other than shelf stable items and meals ready to eat are available at any such shelter that is to be used for long term
    stays; f. a reassessment of the emergency shelter supply stockpile at least annually, as well as immediately before and after such plan is activated, to determine whether appropriate supplies are available and adequate; g. to the extent practicable,
    a plan for shower and laundry facilities for persons who remain in shelters after three days; h. a mechanism for tracking the daily census at each shelter, including the number of persons with special medical needs, the number of persons who enter
    and exit each day, and to the extent practicable, a general description of the locations to which such persons exited; i. a mechanism to track the medical needs of persons at shelters who request assistance in meeting such needs, including but not
    limited to needed medications and placement in the proper type of shelter; j. a mechanism to advise persons who receive federal, state or city public assistance benefits of how to avoid disruption of such benefits due to an inability to meet program
    requirements as a result of their stay in such shelter; k. a mechanism to provide that all shelters are made usable to persons with disabilities to the extent practicable and to identify facilities in the shelter system that are accessible to persons
    with disabilities; l. a description of how persons, including those with disabilities, are assigned to shelter facilities; and m. a mechanism to consult community based organizations and service providers with relevant expertise in regard to the development
    of such plan.
