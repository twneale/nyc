    and practices of the city of New York. Nothing in this local law shall be construed to prohibit any city agency from cooperating with federal immigration authorities when required under federal law. Nothing in this local law shall be interpreted or
    applied so as to create any power, duty or obligation in conflict with any federal or state law. e. No private right of action. Nothing contained in this section or in the administration or application hereof shall be construed as creating any private
    right of action on the part of any persons or entity against the city of New York or the department. f. Reporting. No later than September 30, 2013, and no later than September thirtieth of each year thereafter, the department shall post a report
