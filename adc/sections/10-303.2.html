For purposes of this section, the terms &quot;firearm,&quot; &quot;handgun,&quot; &quot;dealer,&quot; &quot;collector,&quot; and &quot;manufacturer&quot; shall have the meanings set forth in 18 U.S.C. §921, as such section
    may be amended from time to time, or any successor provision thereto. The term &quot;transfer&quot; shall be deemed to include any sale, assignment, pledge, lease, loan, gift or other disposition. References to &quot;statutes, laws or regulations&quot; shall be deemed
    to include federal, state and local statutes, laws, local laws, ordinances, rules and regulations. b. Manufacturer and Dealer Liability. A manufacturer or dealer shall be liable for any injury or death caused by a firearm that it has transferred,
    if (i) such injury or death results from the use of such firearm by an individual not authorized by law to possess such firearm in the city of New York, and (ii) such manufacturer or dealer, or any other individual or entity acting subsequent to such
    manufacturer or dealer, unlawfully transferred such firearm at any time prior to such injury or death. Such liability also includes the possible imposition of punitive damages. Liability under this section does not extend to any manufacturer or dealer
    that has complied with the following standards during a period of one year immediately preceding and including the transfer of such firearm: (1) The manufacturer or dealer executes no transfers or agreements to transfer at gun shows except for gun
    shows that maintain a practice of performing instant criminal background checks consistent with 18 U.S.C. § 922(t), as such subsection may be amended from time to time and any successor provision thereto, on all transfers, whether by licensed or unlicensed
    sellers. (2) Any place of business operated by the manufacturer or dealer is located at a fixed address where: (a) a record is maintained, as may be required by any statute, law or regulation, of the make, model, caliber or gauge, and serial number
    of all firearms held in inventory or offered for sale; and (b) a record is maintained, as may be required by any statute, law or regulation, of the make, model, caliber or gauge, and serial number of all firearms sold, and of any identifying information
    required by any such statute, law or regulation to be obtained from purchasers; (3) The manufacturer or dealer provides access to the aforementioned records to officers, employees and agents of public agencies conducting inspections, to the full extent
    required by applicable statutes, laws and regulations; (4) The manufacturer or dealer limits transfers to any individual or entity to one handgun in any given thirty-day period, provided that this paragraph shall not apply to lawful transfers to (a)
    public agencies in furtherance of official business; (b) law enforcement officers employed by public agencies; (c) private security firms, holding any permits or licenses required by applicable statutes, laws and regulations, for the use of their
    agents and employees; (d) private operators of state and local correctional facilities, for the use of their agents and employees; or (e) licensed manufacturers, licensed dealers or licensed collectors, as those terms are defined by 18 U.S.C. § 921,
    as such section may be amended from time to time, or any successor provision thereto; (5) The manufacturer or dealer has complied with all applicable statutes, laws and regulations governing the transfer of firearms; and (6) The manufacturer or dealer
    has not transferred a firearm to any other manufacturer or dealer in circumstances in which the manufacturer or dealer transferring such firearm knew or should have known that such manufacturer or dealer had not complied with the standards set forth
    in this subdivision. c. Exceptions. (1) No action may be commenced pursuant to this section by any person injured or killed by the discharge of a firearm that is lawfully possessed by a law enforcement official employed by a public agency. (2) This
    section shall not limit in scope any cause of action, other than that provided by this section, available to a person injured by or killed by a firearm. (3) Nothing in this section shall prevent a manufacturer or dealer from seeking whole or partial
    indemnity or contribution for any liability incurred under this section from any third party wholly or partially responsible for the injury or death. (4) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision b, there shall be no basis for liability under
    this section if the manufacturer or dealer proves by a preponderance of the evidence that: (i) the person injured or killed by the discharge of a firearm was committing or attempting to commit a crime (whether or not such crime is actually charged);
    (ii) the unlawful transfer or possession of the firearm is solely a result of the failure of the owner of the firearm to renew a license, permit or registration within six months of the date such renewal is required; or (iii) prior to the injury or
    death caused by the firearm, a lawful possessor of the firearm has reported its theft to a federal, state or local law enforcement agency, or reported its loss to an appropriate public agency. (5) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision b, there
    shall be no basis for liability under this section if the manufacturer or dealer proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the manufacturer or dealer lawfully transferred the firearm to: (i) a public agency in furtherance of official business;
    (ii) a law enforcement officer employed by a public agency; (iii) a private security firm, holding any permits or licenses required by applicable statutes, laws and regulations, for the use of its agents and employees; or (iv) a private operator of
    a state or local correctional facility for the use of its agents and employees. (6) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision b, there shall be no basis for liability under this section if the manufacturer or dealer proves by a preponderance of
    the evidence that the injury or death is not directly or indirectly related to any act or omission by such manufacturer or dealer, including but not limited to any failure by the manufacturer or dealer to comply with the standards set forth in subdivision
    b of this section.</span>
