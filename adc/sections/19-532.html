Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the commission is hereby authorized to issue additional taxicab licenses, provided, however, that such additional licenses shall be issued

    public sale was authorized by chapter sixty-three of the laws of two thousand three, and shall be fully transferable and subject to the provisions of this chapter and of chapter sixty-five of the New York city charter. The commission shall prescribe
    by rule the procedures for the issuance and public sale of such additional licenses, by public auction, sealed bids or other competitive process. b. Of the total number of taxicab licenses issued by the commission pursuant to subdivision a of this

    owners of such licenses either be powered by compressed natural gas or be a hybrid electric vehicle, and fifty-four shall be issued subject to the requirement that the vehicles operated by or under agreement with the owners of such licenses be fully
    accessible to persons with disabilities in accordance with standards established by the commission; and provided further that if the prices which the commission is able to obtain for the issuance of licenses subject to either of the foregoing requirements
    does not exceed ninety percent of the average price otherwise obtained by the commission for the issuance of licenses pursuant to this section, the commission is authorized to issue such licenses without such requirement. c. In the event that the
    city of New York is authorized to issue taxicab licenses in addition to those authorized by chapter sixty-three of the laws of two thousand three, such additional licenses shall be issued by the commission only after completion by the commission of
    such review as may be required by article eight of the New York state environmental conservation law. Such additional licenses shall be issued in a number not to exceed the number of taxicab licenses whose public sale is authorized by law and in accordance
    with the procedures and conditions set forth in subdivision a of this section, except that the first one hundred fifty such licenses issued shall be subject to the requirement that the vehicles operated by or under agreement with the owners of such
    licenses be fully accessible to persons with disabilities in accordance with standards established by the commission, regardless of the prices which the commission is able to obtain for the issuance of such licenses. d. The terms and conditions for
    the public sale of licenses pursuant to this section shall explicitly provide that vehicles operated by or under agreement with the owners of such licenses shall be entitled to accept hails from passengers in the street in accordance with paragraph
    one of subdivision a of <a href='/adc/sections/19-504.html'>section 19-504</a> of this code.</span>
