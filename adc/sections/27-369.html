                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/adc/sections/27-369.html'>§ 27-369</a> Corridors. Corridors shall be kept readily accessible and unobstructed at all times. Corridors shall be kept free of combustible contents except that in buildings classified in occupancy groups G, H-1 and H-2, combustible contents may be stored
    in noncombustible lockers and combustible bulletin boards meeting the requirements of table 5-4 shall be permitted. (a) Capacity. The capacity and minimum width of corridors shall be as listed in table 6-1. Width shall be measured in the clear between
    the narrowest points produced by any projections such as radiators, lockers, drinking fountains, or room or locker door swings, except that such width may be reduced by projections up to eighteen inches wide to the extent of two inches per unit of
    exit width if the total area of such projections does not exceed five per cent of the area of the wall on which they occur. (b) Height. Corridors shall have a clear height of seven feet six inches for at least seventy-five per cent of the floor area,
    with no point less than seven feet in height. No projection below the ceiling shall be located so as to obstruct full view of exit signs. (c) Length. Corridors shall be subdivided by smoke barriers, as defined in subchapter two, into the following
    lengths: Educational occupancy group G....................300 ft. Institutional occupancy groups H-1 and H-2.......150 ft. Residential occupancy groups J-1 and J-2.........150 ft. Where smoke barriers are penetrated by doors, such doors shall be smoke
    stop doors in conformance with subdivision (c) of <a href='/adc/sections/27-371.html'>section 27-371</a> of this article. (d) Dead ends. Dead ends in corridors shall not exceed the length listed in table 6-1, except that in all occupancy groups except occupancy group H, when a corridor
    is completely enclosed in construction having a two hour fire-resistance rating, with all corridor doors being self-closing and having a fire protection rating of one and one-half hours, the permissible length of dead ends may be increased one hundred
    per cent above the length listed in table 6-1. Dead end distance shall be measured from the centerline of the door opening nearest to the closed end of the corridor to the center of an exit door opening, or the center of that point in the corridor
    where travel to two or more exits becomes available in two directions. (e) Changes in level. Changes in level requiring less than two risers in a corridor shall be by a ramp complying with <a href='/adc/sections/27-377.html'>section 27-377</a> of this article. Risers and treads shall comply
    with the requirements of subdivision (e) of <a href='/adc/sections/27-375.html'>section 27-375</a> of this article. (f) Exterior corridors. Exterior corridors shall be roofed, and shall have solid floors drained to prevent accumulations of standing water. Such floors may serve as fire canopies
    when so constructed. Exterior corridors shall be protected along their outer side by guards or parapets at least three feet six inches high. Openings in guards or parapets shall be of such dimensions as to prevent the passage of a five inch dia. ball.
    Where the outer side of an exterior corridor is more than fifty per cent enclosed with solid material, it shall be treated as an interior corridor. (g) Balconies. Balconies may serve as a means of egress from dwelling units in buildings classified
    in occupancy group J-2 under the following conditions: (1) They shall serve at least two dwelling units. (2) They shall be constructed as required for exterior corridors, except that parapets or guards shall not be higher than four feet on the outer
    side of the balcony. (3) The dwelling units served by balconies shall be separated from each other by construction having at least a two hour fire resistance rating. Such separation shall extend at least three feet beyond the outside face of the exterior
    wall of the building, although such projection may be reduced to two feet six inches provided that any window opening on each such balcony served by the fire separation shall be at least two inches from such fire separation for every one inch that
    such separation is less than thirty-six inches. An opening at least twenty inches wide shall be provided between the end of this separation and the balcony parapet or guard, and the opening shall be maintained free and unobstructed for the full height
    of the balcony, except that privacy screens openable from either side may be permitted in the opening. (4) Access from dwelling units to the balconies shall be through doors having glass panels at least two feet wide and four feet high, without muntins,
    screens, or other obstructions to hinder entry by breaking the glass panels. The doors shall be lockable only from the inside by devices that can be easily released from the outside after breaking the glass. A combination lock or lock required to
    be opened by a key or removable device or tool shall not be used. (h) Construction. (1) Interior corridors. Interior corridors shall be completely enclosed within fire separations to provide a minimum fire-resistance rating of one hour except as otherwise
    provided in subparagraphs a through c of this paragraph: a. For buildings or spaces classified in occupancy group J-1 or J-2 of combustible construction group II exceeding two stories in height, except for buildings not exceeding three stories in
    height and occupied exclusively by not more than one family on each story without boarders, roomers or lodgers, corridors shall be enclosed within fire separations providing a minimum fire-resistance rating of two hours. b. Corridor partitions may
    be omitted or may be constructed of unrated noncombustible material in buildings in occupancy group H-2 in the following instances: nurses&#39; stations not exceeding three hundred fifty square feet in area, waiting spaces, lounges and recreational spaces
    for patients and visitors which do not exceed five hundred square feet in area, spaces used solely for public telephones, and all other spaces which are completely protected by an automatic wet sprinkler system complying with the construction requirements
    of subchapter seventeen of this code. c. Corridor partitions may be omitted in spaces of occupancy group H-1 used for detention of persons under legal restraint. (2) Exterior corridors and balconies. Exterior corridors and balconies shall be constructed
    of noncombustible materials. (i) Borrowed lights. No operable transoms shall be permitted in walls of corridors. In corridors required to have a one hour fire-resistance rating, fixed one-quarter inch wire glass panels may be installed in not more
    than twenty percent of the common wall between the corridor and any room or space, provided that no panel exceeds seven hundred twenty square inches in area; however, openings permitted in paragraph three of subdivision (h) of <a href='/adc/sections/27-370.html'>section 27-370</a> of this
    article may be permitted provided all of the limitations and requirements specified in that section are complied with, except that openings in corridor walls serving as fire divisions required to have a fire-resistance rating shall be limited to those
    specified in <a href='/adc/sections/27-342.html'>section 27-342</a> of article five of subchapter five of this chapter. (j) Ventilation. Corridors shall be ventilated in accordance with the requirements of subchapter twelve of this chapter. Corridors shall not be used as open plenums or
    as ducts to exhaust air from rooms or spaces opening upon them, except as permitted in reference standard RS 13-1. (k) Interior finish. The interior finish of corridors shall be in accordance with the requirements of table 5-4.</span>
