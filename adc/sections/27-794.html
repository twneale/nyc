(1) All liquid fuel piping and fuel oil storage tanks shall be hydrostatically tested for tightness by the contractor who made the installation before the work is closed in and before
    the system is operated. The piping shall be tested at one and one-half times the maximum working pressure applicable to that part of the piping system but at a pressure less than the test pressure required for the storage tank. The minimum pressure
    for testing tanks shall be one and one-half times the maximum working pressure applicable to the tank but in no case less than twenty-five psi. The hydrostatic pressure shall be maintained until all joints and connections have been visually inspected
    for leaks, but in no case for less than one-half hour. The tank shall not show any permanent deformation as a result of the test. A record shall be kept of the pressure tests showing the name of the contractor and the pressures at which the piping
    and the tank were tested. (2) Gas distribution piping shall be tested for tightness by the contractor who made the installation before the work is closed in and before the system is operated, in accordance with the requirements of <a href='/adc/sections/27-922.html'>section 27-922</a> of
    article seven of subchapter sixteen of this chapter. For gas storage tanks see chapter four of this title. (b) Inspections. Fuel burning equipment shall be inspected in accordance with the requirements for controlled inspections in subchapter one,
    except that the inspections may be made by an architect or engineer who need not be in the employ of the owner or by a representative of the commissioner. (c) Temporary use permit. A temporary equipment use permit, as provided in subchapter one, may
    be issued by the commissioner upon receipt of a statement signed by the contractor who made the installation, certifying that: (1) The portions of the work completed conform with all provisions of the code listing at the same time any items still
    to be completed. (2) All required pressure tests have been successfully completed on the portion of the work installed and giving the pressures at which the tests were made. (d) Instruction cards. For oil burning systems, cards giving complete instructions
    for the care and operation of the system shall be furnished and shall be permanently located in an easily visible and accessible location near the equipment. (e) Exceptions. An equipment use permit shall not be required for any installation for which
    a work permit is not required as provided in section 27-189 of article eighteen of subchapter one of this chapter.</span>
