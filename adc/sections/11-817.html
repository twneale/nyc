                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/adc/sections/11-817.html'>§ 11-817</a> Interest and penalties. (a) Interest on underpayments. If any amount of tax is not paid on or before the last date prescribed for payment (without regard to any extension of time granted for payment), interest on such amount at the rate set
    by the commissioner of finance pursuant to subdivision (g) of this section, or, if no rate is set, at the rate of seven and one-half percent per annum, shall be paid for the period from such last date to the date of payment. In computing the amount
    of interest to be paid, such interest shall be compounded daily. Interest under this subdivision shall not be paid if the amount thereof is less than one dollar. (b) * (1) Failure to file return. (A) In case of failure to file a return under this
    chapter on or before the prescribed date (determined with regard to any extension of time for filing), unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, there shall be added to the amount required to be
    shown as tax on such return five percent of the amount of such tax if the failure is for not more than one month, with an additional five percent for each additional month or fraction thereof during which such failure continues, not exceeding twenty-five
    percent in the aggregate. (B) In the case of a failure to file a return of tax within sixty days of the date prescribed for filing of such return (determined with regard to any extension of time for filing), unless it is shown that such failure is
    due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, the addition to tax under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall not be less than the lesser of one hundred dollars or one hundred percent of the amount required to be shown as tax on such
    return. (C) For purposes of this paragraph, the amount of tax required to be shown on the return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is paid on or before the date prescribed for payment of the tax and by the amount of any credit
    against the tax which may be claimed upon the return. * NB Amended Ch. 765/85 § 51, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14 (2) Failure to pay tax shown on return. In case of failure to pay the amount shown as tax on a return required to be filed
    under this chapter on or before the prescribed date (determined with regard to any extension of time for payment), unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, there shall be added to the amount shown
    as tax on such return one-half of one percent of the amount of such tax if the failure is not for more than one month, with an additional one-half of one percent for each additional month or fraction thereof during which such failure continues, not
    exceeding twenty-five percent in the aggregate. For the purpose of computing the addition for any month the amount of tax shown on the return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is paid on or before the beginning of such month
    and by the amount of any credit against the tax which may be claimed upon the return. If the amount of tax required to be shown on a return is less than the amount shown as tax on such return, this paragraph shall be applied by substituting such lower
    amount. (3) Failure to pay tax required to be shown on return. In case of failure to pay any amount in respect of any tax required to be shown on a return required to be filed under this chapter which is not so shown (including a determination made
    pursuant to <a href='/adc/sections/11-810.html'>section 11-810</a> of this chapter) within ten days of the date of a notice and demand therefor, unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, there shall be added to the amount of tax stated
    in such notice and demand one-half of one percent of such tax if the failure is not for more than one month, with an additional one-half of one percent for each additional month or fraction thereof during which such failure continues, not exceeding
    twenty-five percent in the aggregate. For the purpose of computing the addition for any month, the amount of tax stated in the notice and demand shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is paid before the beginning of such month.
    * (4) Limitations on additions. (A) With respect to any return, the amount of the addition under paragraph one of this subdivision shall be reduced by the amount of the addition under paragraph two of this subdivision for any month to which an addition
    applies under both paragraphs one and two. In any case described in subparagraph (B) of paragraph one of this subdivision, the amount of the addition under such paragraph one shall not be reduced below the amount provided in such subparagraph. (B)
    With respect to any return, the maximum amount of the addition permitted under paragraph three of this subdivision shall be reduced by the amount of the addition under paragraph one of this subdivision (determined without regard to subparagraph (B)
    of such paragraph one) which is attributable to the tax for which the notice and demand is made and which is not paid within ten days of such notice and demand. * NB Amended Ch. 765/85 § 51, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14 * (c) Underpayment
    due to negligence. (1) If any part of an underpayment of tax is due to negligence or intentional disregard of this chapter or any rules or regulations hereunder (but without intent to defraud), there shall be added to the tax a penalty equal to five
    percent of the underpayment. (2) There shall be added to the tax (in addition to the amount determined under paragraph one of this subdivision) an amount equal to fifty percent of the interest payable under subdivision (a) of this section with respect
    to the portion of the underpayment described in such paragraph one which is attributable to the negligence or intentional disregard referred to in such paragraph one, for the period beginning on the last date prescribed by law for payment of such
    underpayment (determined without regard to any extension) and ending on the date of the assessment of the tax (or, if earlier, the date of the payment of the tax). * NB Amended Ch. 765/85 § 51, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14 * (d) Underpayment
    due to fraud. (1) If any part of an underpayment of tax is due to fraud, there shall be added to the tax a penalty equal to fifty percent of the underpayment. (2) There shall be added to the tax (in addition to the penalty determined under paragraph
    one of this subdivision) an amount equal to fifty percent of the interest payable under subdivision (a) of this section with respect to the portion of the underpayment described in such paragraph one which is attributable to fraud, for the period
    beginning on the last day prescribed by law for payment of such underpayment (determined without regard to any extension) and ending on the date of the assessment of the tax (or, if earlier, the date of the payment of the tax). (3) The penalty under
    this subdivision shall be in lieu of any other addition to tax imposed by subdivision (b) or (c) of this section. * NB Amended Ch. 765/85 § 51, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14 (e) Additional penalty. Any person who, with fraudulent intent,
    shall fail to pay any tax imposed by this chapter, or to make, render, sign or certify any return, or to supply any information within the time required by or under this chapter, shall be liable for a penalty of not more than one thousand dollars,
    in addition to any other amounts required under this chapter to be imposed, assessed and collected by the commissioner of finance. The commissioner of finance shall have the power, in his or her discretion, to waive, reduce or compromise any penalty
    under this subdivision. (f) The interest and penalties imposed by this section shall be paid and disposed of in the same manner as other revenues from this subchapter. Unpaid interest and penalties may be enforced in the same manner as the tax imposed
    by this chapter. (g) (1) Authority to set interest rates. The commissioner of finance shall set the rate of interest to be paid pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section, but if no such rate of interest is set, such rate shall be deemed to be set
    at seven and one-half percent per annum. Such rate shall be the rate prescribed in paragraph two of this subdivision but shall not be less than seven and one-half percent per annum. Any such rate set by the commissioner of finance shall apply to taxes,
    or any portion thereof, which remain or become due on or after the date on which such rate becomes effective and shall apply only with respect to interest computed or computable for periods or portions of periods occurring in the period in which such
    rate is in effect. (2) General rule. The rate of interest set under this subdivision shall be the sum of (i) the federal short-term rate as provided under paragraph three of this subdivision, plus (ii) seven percentage points. (3) Federal short-term
    rate. For purposes of this subdivision: (A) The federal short-term rate for any month shall be the federal short-term rate determined by the United States secretary of the treasury during such month in accordance with subsection (d) of section twelve
    hundred seventy-four of the internal revenue code for use in connection with section six thousand six hundred twenty-one of the internal revenue code. Any such rate shall be rounded to the nearest full percent (or, if a multiple of one-half of one
    percent, such rate shall be increased to the next highest full percent). (B) Period during which rate applies. (i) In general. Except as provided in clause (ii) of this subparagraph, the federal short-term rate for the first month in each calendar
    quarter shall apply during the first calendar quarter beginning after such month. (ii) Special rule for the month of September, nineteen hundred eighty-nine. The federal short-term rate for the month of April, nineteen hundred eighty-nine shall apply
    with respect to setting the rate of interest for the month of September, nineteen hundred eighty-nine. (4) Publication of interest rate. The commissioner of finance shall cause to be published in the city record, and give other appropriate general
    notice of, the interest rate to be set under this subdivision no later than twenty days preceding the first day of the calendar quarter during which such interest rate applies. The setting and publication of such interest rate shall not be included
    within paragraph (a) of subdivision five of section one thousand forty-one of the city charter relating to the definition of a rule. * (h) Miscellaneous. (1) The certificate of the commissioner of finance to the effect that a tax has not been paid,
    that a motor vehicle has not be registered, that a return has not been filed, or that information has not been supplied pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, shall be presumptive evidence thereof. (2) Cross-reference: For criminal penalties,
    see chapter forty of this title. * NB Amended Ch. 765/85 § 51, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14</span>
