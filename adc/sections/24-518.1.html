                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/nyc/adc/sections/24-518.1.html'>§ 24-518.1</a> Food waste disposals. a. The following terms, as used in this section, shall have the following meanings: 1. A &quot;dwelling&quot; is any building or structure or portion thereof which is occupied in whole or in part as the home, residence or sleeping
    place of one or more human beings. 2. A &quot;private dwelling&quot; is any building or structure designed and occupied for residential purposes by not more than two families. Private dwellings shall also be deemed to include a series of one-family or two-family
    dwelling units each of which faces or is accessible to a legal street or public thoroughfare, if each such dwelling unit is equipped as a separate dwelling unit with all essential services, and if each such unit is arranged so that it may be approved
    as a legal one-family or two-family dwelling. 3. A &quot;multiple dwelling&quot; is a dwelling which is either rented, leased, let or hired out, to be occupied, or is occupied, as the residence or home of three or more families living independently of each
    other. A multiple dwelling shall also include residential quarters for members of personnel of any hospital staff which are not located in any building used primarily for hospital use, but any building which was erected, altered or converted prior
    to July first, nineteen hundred fifty-five, to be occupied by such members or personnel or is so occupied on such date shall not be subject to the requirements of the housing maintenance code only so long as it continues to be so occupied if there
    are local laws applicable to such building and such building is in compliance with such local laws. A multiple dwelling does not include (i) a hospital, convent, monastery, asylum or public institution; or (ii) a fireproof building used wholly for
    commercial purposes except for not more than one janitor&#39;s apartment and not more than one penthouse occupied by not more than two families. 4. The term &quot;putrescible solid waste&quot; shall mean solid waste containing organic matter having the tendency
    to decompose with the formation of malodorous by-products. b. Food waste disposals for the discharge of putrescible food wastes from dwelling units may be installed in private dwellings and multiple dwellings, provided that: 1. all putrescible food
    wastes discharged to a sanitary sewer or to a combined storm and sanitary sewer are discharged in fluid form and at a reasonably uniform rate so as to prevent clogging or stoppage of the drain line, sanitary sewer or combined storm and sanitary sewer;
    2. the installation of such food waste disposals is approved by the department of buildings and is in compliance with applicable provisions of the administrative code. c. 1. The department shall conduct a pilot study of the use of food waste disposals
    in private dwellings and multiple dwellings served by combined storm and sanitary sewer systems. The study shall include, but need not be limited to, an analysis of the following: i. the impact of grease and food solids on combined sewers; ii. the
    impact on water consumption; iii. the impact on the nutrient content of raw and treated effluent; iv. the impact of increased pollutant loadings to receiving waters, including increases in biological oxygen demand and suspended solids; v. the impacts
    on wastewater treatment processes; vi. the impact on sludge treatment processes and management; vii. the impact on the city&#39;s ability to comply with applicable statutes, rules, regulations, permits and orders; viii. the impact on solid waste management
    as determined by the department of sanitation; and ix. any other impacts on the environment, public health and safety, and the cost of operating the water and sewer system. 2. The department may select an appropriate number of private dwellings or
    multiple dwellings within the city served by combined storm and sanitary sewer systems to participate in the pilot study. The number of food waste disposals that will be installed as part of the pilot study shall be no fewer than one hundred and shall
    not exceed one thousand. The study shall be deemed to have commenced when food waste disposals are installed in at least fifty percent of the dwelling units in the dwellings selected for the study and the commissioner has authorized the operation
    of these disposals; provided, however, that the department may deem the study to have commenced upon the installation of food waste disposals in less than fifty percent of the dwelling units within the dwellings selected for the study if the department
    finds that a valid study may be conducted with such lesser percentage of installations. In combined storm and sanitary sewer areas, food waste disposals may be installed only in those dwellings selected by the department to participate in the study.
    3. The department shall within fifteen months of the commencement of the pilot study, but not later than twenty-one months from the effective date of this local law submit a report to the mayor and the council which shall include a detailed analysis
    of the findings of such study and conclusions and recommendations based on such analysis with respect to the installation of food waste disposals in private dwellings and multiple dwellings served by combined storm and sanitary sewer systems.</span>
