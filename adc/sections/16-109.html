    law by reason of such injury or illness, exclusive of the death benefit provided for in section sixteen of the workers&#39; compensation law; and (b) the amount which such employee would have received in full pay or compensation for absences from such
    duty on or after April eighteenth, nineteen hundred sixty-two because of such injury or illness if <a href='//sections/16-108.html'>section 16-108</a> of this title, as qualified by the rules and regulations adopted by the commissioner pursuant to such section, were applicable thereto;
