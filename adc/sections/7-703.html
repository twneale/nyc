                    <span class="" style=""><a href='//sections/7-703.html'>§ 7-703</a> Public nuisance defined. The following are declared to be public nuisances: (a) Any building, erection or place, including one- or two-family dwellings, used for the purpose of prostitution as defined in section 230.00 of the penal law. Two
    or more criminal convictions of persons for acts of prostitution in the building, erection or place, including one- or two-family dwellings, within the one-year period preceding the commencement of an action under this chapter, shall be presumptive
    evidence that the building, erection or place, including one- or two-family dwellings, is a public nuisance. In any action under this subdivision, evidence of the common fame and general reputation of the building, erection or place, including one-
    or two-family dwellings, of the inmates or occupants thereof, or of those resorting thereto, shall be competent evidence to prove the existence of the public nuisance. If evidence of the general reputation of the building, erection or place, including
    one- or two-family dwellings, or of the inmates or occupants thereof, is sufficient to establish the existence of the public nuisance, it shall be prima facie evidence of knowledge thereof and acquiescence and participation therein and responsibility
    for the nuisance, on the part of the owners, lessors, lessees and all those in possession of or having charge of, as agent or otherwise, or having any interest in any form in the property, real or personal, used in conducting or maintaining the public
    nuisance; (b) Any building, erection or place, including one- or two-family dwellings, used for the purpose of obscene performances. The term &quot;obscene&quot; shall have the same meaning as that term is defined in subdivision one of section 235.00 of the

    of persons for production, presentation or direction of an obscene performance or for participation in such performance, in the building, erection or place, including one- or two-family dwellings, within the one-year period preceding the commencement
    of an action under this chapter, shall be presumptive evidence that the building, erection or place, including one- or two-family dwellings, is a public nuisance; (c) Any building, erection or place, including one- or two-family dwellings, used for
    the purpose of promotion of obscene material. The term &quot;obscene&quot; shall have the same meaning as that term is defined in subdivision one of section 235.00 of the penal law. The term &quot;material&quot; shall have the same meaning as that term is defined in
    subdivision two of section 235.00 of the penal law. Two or more convictions, as defined in subdivision thirteen of section 1.20 of the criminal procedure law, of persons for promotion of or possession with intent to promote obscene material in the
    building, erection or place, including one- or two-family dwellings, within the one-year period preceding the commencement of an action under this chapter, shall be presumptive evidence that the building, erection or place, including one- or two-family
    dwellings, is a public nuisance; (d) Any building, erection or place, other than a one-or two-family dwelling classified in occupancy group J-3 pursuant to <a href='//sections/27-237.html'>section 27-237</a> of this code, which is in violation of article five of subchapter two of chapter

    law, of persons for offenses, as defined in subdivision one of section 10.00 of the penal law, in violation of the aforesaid provisions of this code in the building, erection or place, including one- or two-family dwellings, within the period of one-year
    preceding the commencement of an action under this chapter, shall be presumptive evidence that the building, erection or place, including one- or two-family dwellings, is a public nuisance; (e) Any building, erection or place, other than a one-or
    two-family dwelling classified in occupancy group J-3 pursuant to <a href='//sections/27-237.html'>section 27-237</a> of this code, which is a nuisance as defined in <a href='//sections/17-142.html'>section 17-142</a> of this code or which is an infected and uninhabitable house as defined in <a href='//sections/17-159.html'>section 17-159</a> of this code
    or which is in violation of subdivision two of <a href='//sections/16-118.html'>section 16-118</a> of this code; (f) Any building, erection or place, including one- or two-family dwellings, used for the purpose of a business, activity or enterprise which is not licensed as required by
    law; (g) Any building, erection or place, including one- or two-family dwellings, wherein, within the period of one year prior to the commencement of an action under this chapter, there have occurred three or more violations of one or any combination

    (n) Any building, erection or place, including one- or two-family dwellings, in which a security guard, as defined in subdivision six of section eighty-nine-f of the general business law, is employed in violation of one or more of the following provisions:
