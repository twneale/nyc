Each agent shall affix to each package of cigarettes stamps evidencing the payment of tax imposed by this chapter and shall cancel such stamps prior to delivery of such cigarettes to
    any dealer in the city, unless stamps have been affixed to such packages of cigarettes and cancelled before such agent received them. b. Each dealer, other than an agent, in the city shall immediately upon the receipt of any cigarettes at his or her
    place of business mark in ink on each unopened box, carton or other container of such cigarettes the word &quot;received&quot; and the year, month, day and hour of such receipt and shall affix his or her signature thereto or shall mark them in any other manner
    prescribed by the commissioner of finance. In addition, each retail dealer shall, within twenty-four hours after receipt of any cigarettes at his or her place of business and prior to exposing for sale or sale by such retail dealer of such cigarettes,
    open such box, carton or other container and, unless such stamps have been previously affixed, immediately notify the dealer from whom he or she purchased such cigarettes and arrange for the replacement by the dealer of such cigarettes by cigarettes
    with such stamps affixed within twenty-four hours. c. Stamps shall be cancelled in the manner prescribed by regulation. d. Whenever any cigarettes are found in the place of business of a dealer without the stamps affixed and cancelled, or not marked
    as having been received within the preceding twenty-four hours, the prima facie presumption shall arise that such cigarettes are kept therein in violation of the provisions of this chapter. e. Stamps shall be affixed to each package of cigarettes
    of an aggregate denomination not less than the amount of the tax upon the contents therein, and shall be affixed in such manner as to be visible to the purchaser.</span>
