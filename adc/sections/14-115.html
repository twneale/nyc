                    <span class="" style=""><a href='//sections/14-115.html'>§ 14-115</a> Discipline of members. a. The commissioner shall have power, in his or her discretion, on conviction by the commissioner, or by any court or officer of competent jurisdiction, of a member of the force of any criminal offense, or neglect of
    duty, violation of rules, or neglect or disobedience of orders, or absence without leave, or any conduct injurious to the public peace or welfare, or immoral conduct or conduct unbecoming an officer, or any breach of discipline, to punish the offending
    party by reprimand, forfeiting and withholding pay for a specified time, suspension, without pay during such suspension, or by dismissal from the force; but no more than thirty days&#39; salary shall be forfeited or deducted for any offense. All such
    forfeitures shall be paid forthwith into the police pension fund. b. Members of the force, except as elsewhere provided herein, shall be fined, reprimanded, removed, suspended or dismissed from the force only on written charges made or preferred against
    them, after such charges have been examined, heard and investigated by the commissioner or one of his or her deputies upon such reasonable notice to the member or members charged, and in such manner or procedure, practice, examination and investigation
    as such commissioner may, by rules and regulations, from time to time prescribe. c. The commissioner is also authorized and empowered in his or her discretion, to deduct and withhold salary from any member or members of the force, for or on account
    of absence for any cause without leave, lost time, sickness or other disability, physical or mental; provided, however, that the salary so deducted and withheld shall not, except in case of absence without leave, exceed one-half thereof for the period
    of such absence; and provided, further, that not more than one-half pay for three days shall be deducted on account of absence caused by sickness. d. Upon having found a member of the force guilty of the charges preferred against him or her, either
    upon such member&#39;s plea of guilty or after trial, the commissioner or the deputy examining, hearing and investigating the charges, in his or her discretion, may suspend judgment and place the member of the force so found guilty upon probation, for
    a period not exceeding one year; and the commissioner may impose punishment at any time during such period.</span>
