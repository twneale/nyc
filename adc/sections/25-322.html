Upon designation by the commission of any improvement or property as a landmark and of any landmark site, interior landmark or historic district, or any amendment of such designation, the owner of such improvement
    or property shall be notified in writing of such designation by the commission. Such notice shall be sent to the owner or owners at his or her or their last known address or addresses, as the same appear in the records of the office of the commissioner
    of finance or if there is no name in such records, such notice may be sent to the street address of the improvement parcel or property in question, addressed to &quot;Owner&quot;. The failure by the commission to give notice of designation as required by this
    subdivision shall not invalidate or affect any actions or proceedings pursuant to this chapter relating to such improvement parcel or property, except that no action or proceeding pursuant to subparagraph d of this section shall be commenced until
    thirty days after such notice has been given. b. It shall be the duty of the owner or person in charge of an improvement or property that is a landmark, interior landmark or is located on a landmark site or within an historic district to ensure that
    every lease or sublease, or renewal thereof, between the owner or such other person in charge as lessor and a nonresidential tenant as lessee and concerning such improvement or property shall contain a notice, conspicuously set forth therein, stating
    that in accordance with sections 25-305, 25-306, 25-309 or 25-310 of this chapter the lessee must obtain a permit from the commission before commencing any exterior or interior work on the improvement or property, except for ordinary repair and maintenance
    as that term is defined in subdivision r of <a href='/adc/sections/25-302.html'>section 25-302</a> of this chapter. When an improvement or property is designated a landmark, interior landmark or as part of an historic district during the term of a lease or sublease of all or a portion of
    such improvement or property, the lessor of such lease or sublease shall, within thirty days after being notified in writing of such designation by the commission or a person in charge, send a written notice as described above to all nonresidential
    lessees of such lessor. Such notice shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested to all nonresidential lessees on the first two floors of the improvement or property, and shall be sent to all other nonresidential lessees
    by any means reasonably designed to ensure that notice is given. c. The commission shall promulgate such regulations as it deems necessary to comply with the provisions of this section, with respect to notice requirements in all nonresidential leases
    for buildings under its jurisdiction. d. Any person who violates subdivision b of this section, or the regulations promulgated hereunder, shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than five hundred dollars per violation which shall be returnable
    to the environmental control board.</span>
