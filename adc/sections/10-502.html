Any city agency that owns or leases data that includes personal identifying information and any city agency that maintains but does not own data that includes personal identifying information, shall
    immediately disclose to the police department any breach of security following discovery by a supervisor or manager, or following notification to a supervisor or manager, of such breach if such personal identifying information was, or is reasonably
    believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person. b. Subsequent to compliance with the provisions set forth in subdivision a of this section, any city agency that owns or leases data that includes personal identifying information shall disclose,
    in accordance with the procedures set forth in subdivision d of this section, any breach of security following discovery by a supervisor or manager, or following notification to a supervisor or manager, of such breach to any person whose personal
    identifying information was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person. c. Subsequent to compliance with the provisions set forth in subdivision a of this section, any city agency that maintains but does not own data
    that includes personal identifying information shall disclose, in accordance with the procedures set forth in subdivision d of this section, any breach of security following discovery by a supervisor or manager, or following notification to a supervisor
    or manager, of such breach to the owner, lessor or licensor of the data if the personal identifying information was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person. d. The disclosures required by subdivisions b and c of
    this section shall be made as soon as practicable by a method reasonable under the circumstances. Provided said method is not inconsistent with the legitimate needs of law enforcement or any other investigative or protective measures necessary to
    restore the reasonable integrity of the data system, disclosure shall be made by at least one of the following means: 1. Written notice to the individual at his or her last known address; or 2. Verbal notification to the individual by telephonic communication;
    or 3. Electronic notification to the individual at his or her last known e-mail address. e. Should disclosure pursuant to paragraph one, two or three of subdivision d be impracticable or inappropriate given the circumstances of the breach and the
    identity of the victim, such disclosure shall be made by a mechanism of the agency&#39;s election, provided such mechanism is reasonably targeted to the individual in a manner that does not further compromise the integrity of the personal information.</span>
