                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/nyc/adc/sections/16-509.html'>§ 16-509</a> Refusal to issue a license. a. The commission may, by majority vote of its entire membership and after notice and the opportunity to be heard, refuse to issue a license to an applicant who lacks good character, honesty and integrity. Such notice
    shall specify the reasons for such refusal. In making such determination, the commission may consider, but is not limited to: (i) failure by such applicant to provide truthful information in connection with the application; (ii) a pending indictment
    or criminal action against such applicant for a crime which under this subdivision would provide a basis for the refusal of such license, or a pending civil or administrative action to which such applicant is a party and which directly relates to
    the fitness to conduct the business or perform the work for which the license is sought, in which cases the commission may defer consideration of an application until a decision has been reached by the court or administrative tribunal before which
    such action is pending; (iii) conviction of such applicant for a crime which, considering the factors set forth in section seven hundred fifty-three of the correction law, would provide a basis under such law for the refusal of such license; (iv)
    a finding of liability in a civil or administrative action that bears a direct relationship to the fitness of the applicant to conduct the business for which the license is sought; (v) commission of a racketeering activity or knowing association with
    a person who has been convicted of a racketeering activity, including but not limited to the offenses listed in subdivision one of section nineteen hundred sixty-one of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations statute (18 U.S.C. § 1961 et
    seq.) or of an offense listed in subdivision one of section 460.10 of the penal law, as such statutes may be amended from time to time, or the equivalent offense under the laws of any other jurisdiction; (vi) association with any member or associate
    of an organized crime group as identified by a federal, state or city law enforcement or investigative agency when the applicant knew or should have known of the organized crime associations of such person; (vii) having been a principal in a predecessor
    trade waste business as such term is defined in subdivision a of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/16-508.html'>section 16-508</a> of this chapter where the commission would be authorized to deny a license to such predecessor business pursuant to this subdivision; (viii) current membership in a trade
    association where such membership would be prohibited to a licensee pursuant to subdivision j of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/16-520.html'>section 16-520</a> of this chapter unless the commission has determined, pursuant to such subdivision, that such association does not operate in a manner
    inconsistent with the purposes of this chapter; (ix) the holding of a position in a trade association where membership or the holding of such position would be prohibited to a licensee pursuant to subdivision j of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/16-520.html'>section 16-520</a> of this chapter; (x)
    failure to pay any tax, fine, penalty, fee related to the applicant&#39;s business for which liability has been admitted by the person liable therefor, or for which judgment has been entered by a court or administrative tribunal of competent jurisdiction.
    For purposes of determination of the character, honesty and integrity of a trade waste broker pursuant to subdivision c or subdivision d of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/16-507.html'>section 16-507</a> of this chapter, the term &quot;applicant&quot; shall refer to the business of such trade waste broker
    and all the principals thereof; for purposes of determining the good character, honesty and integrity of employees or agents pursuant to <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/16-510.html'>section 16-510</a> of this chapter, the term &quot;applicant&quot; as used herein shall be deemed to apply to employees, agents
    or prospective employees or agents of an applicant for a license or a licensee. b. The commission may refuse to issue a license or registration to an applicant for such license or an applicant for registration who has knowingly failed to provide the
    information and/or documentation required by the commission pursuant to this chapter or any rules promulgated pursuant hereto or who has otherwise failed to demonstrate eligibility for such license under this chapter or any rules promulgated pursuant
    hereto. c. The commission may refuse to issue a license to an applicant when such applicant: (i) was previously issued a license or a trade waste permit pursuant to this chapter or former subchapter eighteen of chapter two of title twenty of this
    code and such license was revoked pursuant to the provisions of this chapter or revoked or not renewed pursuant to the provisions of such former subchapter eighteen or any rules promulgated thereto; or (ii) has been determined to have committed any
    of the acts which would be a basis for the suspension or revocation of a license pursuant to this chapter or any rules promulgated hereto. d. The commission may refuse to issue a license pursuant to this chapter to any applicant, where such applicant
    or any of the principals of such applicant have been principals of a licensee whose license has been revoked pursuant to paragraph two of subdivision b of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/16-513.html'>section 16-513</a> of this chapter.</span>
