    the city, which concerns their dealings with the city, (i) to the commissioner, (ii) to a council member, the public advocate, the comptroller or the mayor, or (iii) to any superior officer. c. An officer or employee (i) of an agency of the city,
    or (ii) of a public agency or public entity subject to the jurisdiction of the commissioner pursuant to chapter thirty-four of the charter who believes that another officer or employee has taken an adverse personnel action in violation of subdivision
    b of this section may report such action to the commissioner. d. 1. Upon receipt of a report made pursuant to subdivision c of this section, the commissioner shall conduct an inquiry to determine whether retaliatory adverse personnel action has been
    taken. 2. Within fifteen days after receipt of an allegation pursuant to subdivision c of this section of a prohibited adverse personnel action, the commissioner shall provide written notice to the officer or employee making the allegation that the
    allegation has been received by the commissioner. Such notice shall include the name of the person in the department of investigation who shall serve as a contact with the officer or employee making the allegation. 3. Upon the completion of an investigation
    initiated under subdivision c of this section, the commissioner shall provide a written statement of the final determination to the officer or employee who complained of the retaliatory adverse personnel action. The statement shall include the commissioner&#39;s
    recommendations, if any, for remedial action, or shall state the commissioner has determined to dismiss the complaint and terminate the investigation. e. 1. Upon a determination that a retaliatory adverse personnel action has been taken with respect
    to an officer or employee of an agency of the city in violation of paragraph one or five of subdivision b of this section, the commissioner shall without undue delay report his or her findings and, if appropriate, recommendations to the head of the
    appropriate agency or entity, who (i) shall determine whether to take remedial action and (ii) shall report such determination to the commissioner in writing. Upon a determination that the agency or entity head has failed to take appropriate remedial
    action, the commissioner shall consult with the agency or entity head and afford the agency or entity head reasonable opportunity to take such action. If such action is not taken, the commissioner shall report his or her findings and the response
    of the agency or entity head (i) if the complainant was employed by an agency the head or members of which are appointed by the mayor, to the mayor, (ii) if the complainant was employed by a non-mayoral agency of the city, to the city officer or officers
    who appointed the agency head, or (iii) if the complainant was employed by a public agency or other public entity not covered by the preceding categories but subject to the jurisdiction of the commissioner pursuant to chapter thirty-four of the charter,
    to the officer or officers who appointed the head of the public agency or public entity, who shall take such action as is deemed appropriate. 2. Any officer or employee of a covered contractor or covered subcontractor who believes that he or she has
    been the subject of an adverse personnel action in violation of paragraph two of subdivision b shall be entitled to bring a cause of action against such covered contractor or covered subcontractor to recover all relief necessary to make him or her
    whole. Such relief may include but shall not be limited to: (i) an injunction to restrain continued retaliation, (ii) reinstatement to the position such employee would have had but for the retaliation or to an equivalent position, (iii) reinstatement
    of full fringe benefits and seniority rights, (iv) payment of two times back pay, plus interest, and (v) compensation for any special damages sustained as a result of the retaliation, including litigation costs and reasonable attorneys&#39; fees. An officer
    or employee described in this paragraph may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction for such relief. An officer or employee who brings a cause of action pursuant to this paragraph shall notify the agency chief contracting officer or
    agency head or commissioner of the contracting agency of such action; provided, however, that failure to provide such notice shall not be a jurisdictional defect, and shall not be a defense to an action brought pursuant to this paragraph. This paragraph
    shall not be deemed to create a right of action against the city, any public agency or other public entity, or local development corporations or not-for-profit corporations the governing boards of which include city officials acting in their official
    capacity or appointees of city officials, nor shall any such public agency, entity or corporation be made a party to an action brought pursuant to this subdivision. f. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the rights of any officer or
    employee with regard to any administrative procedure or judicial review, nor shall anything in this section be construed to diminish or impair the rights of a public employee or employer under any law, rule, regulation or collective bargaining agreement
    or to prohibit any personnel action which otherwise would have been taken regardless of any report of information made pursuant to this section. g. Violation of this section may constitute cause for administrative penalties. h. The commissioner shall
    conduct ongoing public education efforts as necessary to inform employees and officers of covered agencies and contractors of their rights and responsibilities under this section. i. Not later than October thirty-first of each year, the commissioner
    shall prepare and forward to the mayor and the council a report on the complaints governed by this section during the preceding fiscal year. The report shall include, but not be limited to, the number of complaints received pursuant to this section,
    and the disposition of such complaints.</span>
