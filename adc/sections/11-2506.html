                    <span class="" style=""><a href='//sections/11-2506.html'>§ 11-2506</a> Determination of tax. If a return required by this chapter is not filed, or if a return when filed is incorrect or insufficient, the amount of tax due shall be determined by the commissioner of finance from such information as may be obtainable
    and, if necessary, the tax may be estimated on the basis of external indices, such as number of rooms, location, scale of rents, comparable rents, type of accommodations and service, number of employees and/or other factors. Notice of such determination
    shall be given to the person liable for the collection and/or payment of the tax. Such determination shall finally and irrevocably fix the tax unless the person against whom it is assessed, within ninety days after giving of notice of such determination,
    or, if the commissioner of finance has established a conciliation procedure pursuant to <a href='//sections/11-124.html'>section 11-124</a> of the code and the taxpayer has requested a conciliation conference in accordance therewith, within ninety days from the mailing of a conciliation
    decision or the date of the commissioner&#39;s confirmation of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding, both (1) serves a petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2) files a petition with the tax appeals tribunal for a hearing, or unless
    the commissioner of finance of his or her own motion shall redetermine the same. Such hearing and any appeal to the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc from the decision rendered in such hearing shall be conducted in the manner and subject to the
    requirements prescribed by the tax appeals tribunal pursuant to sections one hundred sixty-eight through one hundred seventy-two of the charter. After such hearing the tax appeals tribunal shall give notice of its decision to the person against whom
    the tax is assessed. A decision of the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc shall be reviewable for error, illegality or unconstitutionality or any other reason whatsoever by a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules
    if application therefor is made to the supreme court by the person against whom the tax was assessed, within four months after the giving of the notice of such tax appeals tribunal decision. A proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice
    law and rules shall not be instituted by a person liable for the tax unless: (a) the amount of any tax sought to be reviewed, with penalties and interest thereon, if any, shall be first deposited with the commissioner of finance and there shall be
    filed with the commissioner of finance an undertaking, issued by a surety company authorized to transact business in this state and approved by the superintendent of insurance of this state as to solvency and responsibility, in such amount as a justice
    of the supreme court shall approve, to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, such person will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of the proceeding; or (b) at the option of such person such
    undertaking filed with the commissioner of finance may be in a sum sufficient to cover the taxes, penalties and interest thereon stated in such decision plus the costs and charges which may accrue against it in the prosecution of the proceeding, in
    which event such person shall not be required to deposit such taxes, penalties and interest as a condition precedent to the application.</span>
