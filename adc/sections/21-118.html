                    <span class="" style=""><a href='//sections/21-118.html'>§ 21-118</a> New York city commission for the foster care of children. a. There is hereby established the New York city commission for the foster care of children (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;commission&quot;) to consist of fifteen public members, who shall
    serve without compensation, to be appointed by the mayor from among residents of the city of New York who have been active in, identified with, or otherwise known to be interested in the field of child care. In making such appointments, the mayor
    shall make every effort to appoint individuals associated with the major federations concerned with foster care services to children and individuals who are associated with organizations which, through direct services to children, coordination or
    planning of services for children, or through research in the field of child care, are making major contributions to the planning of services for the children of the city of New York. The membership of the commission shall reflect disciplines basic
    to a wholesome child welfare program including mental health, education, religion, law with some specialty in family and child welfare, and pediatrics. The mayor may appoint, and at his or her pleasure remove, an executive director and an assistant
    to the executive director of the commission. The salary of the executive director and the assistant to the executive director shall be fixed by the mayor and shall be paid from appropriations made to the department. The said public members shall serve
    for a term of four years except that the term of office of the members first taking office shall expire, five at the end of two years, five at the end of three years and five at the end of four years. No member shall serve for more than eight consecutive
    years after July one, nineteen hundred sixty-four. The mayor shall appoint a chairperson and a vice chairperson from among the members, each to serve in that capacity for two year terms. Any public member appointed by the mayor to fill a vacancy occurring
    prior to the expiration of the term for which his or her predecessor was appointed shall be appointed for the remainder of such term. b. The commission shall meet at least once every month except during the months of July and August and shall meet
    at such other times as meetings are called by the chairperson. Whenever requested to do so in writing by any six members of the commission, the chairperson shall call a special meeting of the commission. Full time professional and clerical assistance,
    properly qualified, shall be provided as required to the commission by the department. c. The commission shall have the following powers and duties: (1) Make recommendations to the commissioner and to the administrative judge of the family court of
    the state of New York within the city of New York on all phases of the foster care of children including recommendations designed to prevent the need for such care. (2) Make recommendations to the appropriate authorities for the establishment of proper
    standards for the foster care of children, except insofar as such standards have been established pursuant to law by the board of health of the city of New York or the board of social welfare of the state of New York. (3) Study and report the extent
    and nature of the facilities required to provide adequate foster care for children. (4) Coordinate temporary care services and make recommendations as to the type of children and the age range to be admitted to any temporary shelter, in order that
    the needs of children may be served by the proper and adequate provision of accommodations, and so as to avoid duplication or overlapping of service. (5) Individually or collectively visit temporary shelters in accordance with rules promulgated by
    the commission; recommend to the commissioner and to the administrative judge of the family court of the state of New York within the city of New York studies of foster care facilities with the cooperation of private agencies. (6) Recommend that the
    department maintain such records and compile such statistics as the commission may deem desirable, subject to the approval of the commissioner. (7) Through appropriate channels, advise foster care agencies and institutions receiving public funds on
    all matters relating to the development and modification of programs to meet changing foster care needs. (8) Make appropriate recommendations to the commissioner and to the administrative judge of the family court of the state of New York within the
    city of New York for submission to the mayor on all matters affecting the foster care of children, annually or more often as required. (9) Make appropriate recommendations to reduce insofar as possible the length of stay of children in temporary shelters.
    d. Whenever required to do so by the commission or an authorized representative thereof, any public official or agency of the city of New York possessing information relating to the maintenance or operation of institutions or agencies for the care
    of children, or maintaining records with respect thereto, shall make such information and records available, and shall furnish transcripts or copies thereof, to the commission. e. It shall be the function of this commission to utilize all methods
    provided by law to discourage and prevent any discrimination because of race, color or national origin in the foster care of children. f. In relation to foster care of children the commission shall make appropriate recommendations for the enforcement
    of all provisions of laws relating to foster care including those laws which provide for the preservation and protection of the religious faith of the child to the end that whenever a child is placed or committed by the department or remanded or committed
    by the family court to any family or to any duly authorized association, agency, society, or institution, such placement, remand or commitment must be made, when practicable, to a family or to a duly authorized association, agency, society, or institution
    under the control of persons of the same religious faith or persuasion as that of the child; provided that any and all such foster care placements, whenever made, shall assure the preservation and protection of the religious faith of the child. g.
    Whenever used in this section the following terms shall mean or include: (1) &quot;Foster care for children.&quot; The care of abandoned, destitute, dependent, neglected or delinquent children or persons in need of supervision away from their own homes in institutions
    or foster homes or temporary shelters, in whole or in part at public expense, under the jurisdiction of a social services official or other authorized agency as defined in the social services law. (2) &quot;Temporary shelter.&quot; Any establishment or agency
    receiving public funds which is operated or maintained for the temporary care of destitute, dependent, neglected or delinquent children or persons in need of supervision. (3) &quot;Temporary care.&quot; Care of an abandoned, destitute dependent, neglected or
    delinquent child or person in need of supervision, in a temporary shelter for a brief and transient period, pending return of the child to its own home or placement in long-term care away from its own home.</span>
