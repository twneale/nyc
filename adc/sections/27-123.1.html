    code shall apply to alterations, additions and repairs made to buildings, as well as to changes in occupancy or use, as set forth below. The provisions of sections 27-115, 27-116, 27-117, 27-118 and 27-120 of this code shall not govern the application
    of the provisions of such subarticle. (a) The provisions of subarticle two of article two of subchapter four of chapter one of title twenty-seven of this code shall apply to an entire existing building, as if hereafter erected, when the costs of any
    alterations, additions or repairs, other than ordinary repairs, made within any twelve-month period immediately following the filing of the application exceed fifty percent of the cost of replacement of the building with one of similar floor space,
    as estimated by the department at the beginning of that twelve-month period. When such estimated costs of alterations, additions or repairs, other than ordinary repairs, do not exceed fifty percent of such replacement cost, then the provisions of
    subarticle two of article two of subchapter four of chapter one of title twenty-seven shall apply to such alterations, additions or repairs, although nothing herein is meant to discourage compliance with the standards set forth in subarticle two of
    article two of subchapter four of chapter one of title twenty-seven in other portions of buildings described in this sentence. (b) The provisions of subarticle two of article two of subchapter four of chapter one of title twenty-seven of this code
    shall apply to an entire existing building, as if hereafter erected, when there is a change in occupancy classification of the building. The provisions of subarticle two of article two of subchapter four of chapter one of title twenty-seven of this
    code shall apply to a space in a building when there is a change in the occupancy type thereof or in how such space is used. (c) When any work not otherwise required to comply with the provisions of subarticle two of article two of subchapter four
    of chapter one of title twenty-seven is done on an interior accessible route in existing residential buildings, other than in occupancy group J-3, which work involves plumbing fixtures, that work shall be required to comply with <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/27-292.8.html'>section 27-292.8</a> of
    this code for the extent of the work being performed, provided such work will not require any structural changes or additional partitions; ordinary repairs and replacement of existing piping shall be exempt from the provisions of this sentence. (d)
    Where additions or alterations subject parts of existing systems to loads exceeding those permitted herein, such parts shall be made to comply with this code. (e) The provisions of subarticle two of article two of subchapter four of chapter one of
    title twenty-seven of this code and of subdivisions b and c of this section shall not apply to the alteration of existing residential buildings, other than adult residential care facilities, which are classified in occupancy group J-2 and contain
    no more than three dwelling units or which are classified in occupancy group J-3 and are being altered to contain three dwelling units, and which satisfy the requirements of subdivision (d) of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/27-357.html'>section 27-357</a> of this code, when the cost of any alterations,
    additions or repairs, other than ordinary repairs, made within any twelve-month period immediately following the filing of the application do not exceed fifty percent of the cost of replacement of the building with one of similar floor space, as estimated
    by the department at the beginning of that twelve-month period.
