    the provisions of subdivisions b to i, inclusive, of this section shall be payable with interest on such amount at the valuation rate of interest (as defined in paragraph eleven of subdivision a of <a href='//sections/13-638.2.html'>section 13-638.2</a> of this subchapter) for such pension
    fund for such fiscal year. m. In the determination of the normal contribution payable to FPF with respect to each fiscal year occurring during the period beginning on July first, nineteen hundred ninety and ending on June thirtieth, two thousand ten,
    the present value, as of June thirtieth next preceding such fiscal year, of all future installments of the contributions pay- able to such pension fund pursuant to subdivisions b to i, inclusive, of this section shall be treated as an asset of such
    pension fund. n. (1) All installments of UAL and BSL contribution designated in subdivision i of this section as payable by the city for fiscal years occurring during the period beginning on July first, nineteen hundred ninety-three and ending on
    June thirtieth, two thousand ten are hereby canceled and shall not be due and payable on or after such July first. (2) Subject to the provisions of paragraph three of this subdivision, the actuary of FPF shall determine for such pension fund: (i)
    a schedule of contribution installments, one of which is payable in each fiscal year included in the revised amortization period, which installments will amortize the FPF balance of unfunded UAL subject to consolidated amortization, together with
    interest on such balance; and (ii) a schedule of contribution installments, one of which is payable in each fiscal year included in the revised amortization period, which installments will amortize the FPF balance of unfunded BSL subject consolidated
    amortization, together with interest on such balance. (3) (i) the actuary shall determine each schedule of contribution installments referred to in paragraph two of this subdivision so that each installment after the first shall equal one hundred
    three per centum of the next preceding installment. (ii) in determining each such schedule, the actuary shall employ an interest rate of eight and one-half per centum per annum, compounded annually; provided that if a valuation rate of interest (as
    defined in paragraph eleven of subdivision a of <a href='//sections/13-638.2.html'>section 13-638.2</a> of this subchapter) other than eight and one-half per centum per annum is prescribed by law for FPF for any fiscal year included in the revised amortization period, the schedule contribution
    installments which are required to be paid, for such fiscal year in which such changed valuation rate of interest is in effect to FPF shall be redetermined by the actuary thereof on the basis of a rate of interest equal to such changed rate, compounded
    annually, so as to reflect such changed rate appropriately in such redetermined installments. (4) Any amount required to be contributed to FPF with respect to any fiscal year under the provisions of this subdivision shall be payable with interest
    on such amount at the valuation rate of interest (as defined in paragraph eleven of subdivision a of <a href='//sections/13-638.2.html'>section 13-638.2</a> of this subchapter) for such pension fund for such fiscal year. (5) In the determination of the normal contribution payable to FPF
    with respect to each fiscal year occurring during the revised amortization period, the present value, as of June thirtieth next preceding such fiscal year, of all future installments of the contributions payable to such pension fund pursuant to this
    subdivision shall be treated as an asset of such pension fund. (6) Notwithstanding any provision of the preceding paragraphs of this subdivision or any other law to the contrary, the provisions of such preceding paragraphs shall be superseded in the
    manner prescribed by subdivision o of this section with respect to contributions on account of UAL and BSL payable for each fiscal year included in the fifteen-year amortization period. o. (1) (i) All installments of UAL and BSL contribution designated

    pension fund: (i) a schedule of contribution installments, one of which is payable in each fiscal year included in the fifteen-year amortization period, which installments will amortize the FPF 1995 UAL, together with interest on such UAL; and (ii)
    a schedule of contribution installments, one of which is payable in each fiscal year included in the fifteen-year amortization period, which installments will amortize the FPF 1995 accrued liability on account of required transfers to variable supplements
    funds, together with interest on such liability; and (iii) a schedule of contribution installments, one of which is payable in each fiscal year included in the fifteen-year amortization period, which installments will amortize the FPF 1995 balance

    per centum of the next preceding installment. (ii) In determining each such schedule, the actuary shall employ an interest rate of eight and three-quarters per centum per annum, compounded annually; provided that if a valuation rate of interest (as
    defined in paragraph eleven of subdivision a of <a href='//sections/13-638.2.html'>section 13-638.2</a> of this subchapter) other than eight and three-quarters per centum per annum is prescribed by law for FPF for any fiscal year included in the fifteen-year amortization period, the schedule
    contribution installments which are required to be paid, for such fiscal year in which such changed valuation rate of interest is in effect, to FPF shall be redetermined by the actuary thereof on the basis of a rate of interest equal to such changed
    rate, compounded annually, so as to reflect such changed rate appropriately in such redetermined installments. (4) Any amount required to be contributed to FPF with respect to any fiscal year under the provisions of this subdivision shall be payable
    with interest on such amount at the valuation rate of interest (as defined in paragraph eleven of subdivision a of <a href='//sections/13-638.2.html'>section 13-638.2</a> of this subchapter) for such pension fund for such fiscal year. (5) In each fiscal year of the fifteen-year amortization
