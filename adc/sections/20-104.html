                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/nyc/adc/sections/20-104.html'>§ 20-104</a> Powers of the commissioner with respect to licensing. a. The commissioner shall have cognizance and control of the granting, issuance, transferring, renewal, denial, revocation, suspension and cancellation of all licenses issued under chapter
    two and under all other laws conferring such powers upon him or her. The commissioner or the commissioner&#39;s designee shall collect all fees for all such licenses and permits and shall otherwise enforce the provisions of chapter two. b. The commissioner
    shall, as he or she determines necessary and appropriate, promulgate, amend and rescind regulations and rules: 1. to carry out the powers and duties of the department; 2. to prevent and remedy fraud, misrepresentation, deceit and unconscionable dealing,
    and to promote fair trade practices by those engaging in licensed activities; 3. to require adequate disclosure by those engaging in licensed activities of both the terms and conditions under which they perform licensed activities, adequate disclosure
    of the true names or true corporate names of licensees, and adequate disclosure of applicable local, state and federal law pertinent to consumers&#39; interests regarding the conduct of activities licensed under chapter two; 4. to require that licensees
    keep such records as he or she may determine are necessary or useful for carrying out the purposes of chapter two and, except as specifically set forth in chapter two, retain them for three years; 5. to ensure that all persons and organizations licensed
    under this title have made appropriate financial disclosure, and that the premises complies with all legal requirements necessary to engage in the licensed activity; 6. with respect to licensed activities, to protect the health, safety, convenience
    and welfare of the general public; and 7. to ensure that those engaging in licensed activities do not discriminate against any person on the basis of age, sex, race, color, national origin, creed or religion in violation of city, state or federal
    laws. c. The commissioner shall compile all regulations and rules promulgated by the department and maintain a copy thereof, available for public inspection at his or her principal office at such times as that office shall be open for business. A
    record of each license issued indicating its kind and class, the license number, the fee received therefor and such other records as the commissioner may require shall be kept by the department. d. The commissioner or the commissioner&#39;s designee shall
    be authorized to conduct investigations, to issue subpoenas, to receive evidence, to hear complaints regarding activities for which a license is or may be required, to take depositions on due notice, to serve interrogatories, to hold public and private
    hearings upon due notice, to take testimony and to promulgate, amend and modify procedures and practices governing such proceedings. e. (1) The commissioner shall be authorized, upon due notice and hearing, to suspend, revoke or cancel any license
    issued by him or her in accordance with the provisions of chapter two and to impose or institute fines or civil penalties for the violation of (i) any of the provisions of chapter two of this title and regulations and rules promulgated under chapter
    two of this title and (ii) any of the provisions of any other law, rule or regulation, the enforcement of which is within the jurisdiction of the department including but not limited to subchapter one of chapter five of this title (the consumer protection
    law) subchapter two of chapter five (the truth in-pricing-law); provided that such violation is committed in the course of and is related to the conduct of the business, trade or occupation which is required to be licensed pursuant to chapter two
    of this title. Except to the extent that dollar limits are otherwise specifically provided such fines or civil penalties shall not exceed five hundred dollars for each violation. (2) The commissioner may arrange for the redress of injuries caused
    by such violations, and may otherwise provide for compliance with the provisions and purposes of chapter two of this title. (3) The commissioner or the commissioner&#39;s designee shall be authorized to suspend the license of any person pending payment
    of such fine or civil penalty or pending compliance with any other lawful order of the department. (4) The commissioner shall be authorized to impose a fine or civil penalty or to suspend a license or both for a failure to appear at a hearing at the
    department after due notice of such hearing. If a license has been suspended, it shall be returned to the department forthwith upon receipt of the order of suspension. Failure to surrender the license shall be grounds for a fine or civil penalty or
    revocation of the license. (5) Any of the remedies provided for in this section shall be in addition to any other remedies provided under any other provision of law. f. The commissioner, upon due notice and hearing, may require that persons licensed
    under chapter two of this title who have committed repeated, multiple or persistent violations of chapter two or any other law, rule or regulation the enforcement of which is within the jurisdiction of the department, conspicuously display at their
    place of business and in advertisements a notice (of a form, content and size to be specified by the commissioner), which shall describe the person&#39;s record of such violations; provided that, for each time such display is required, the commissioner
    may require that such notice be displayed for not less than ten nor more than one hundred days. g. The commissioner may refuse to issue or renew any license issued in accordance with the provisions of chapter two of this title and may suspend or revoke
    any such license, after due notice and opportunity to be heard, upon the occurrence of any one or more of the following conditions: 1. Two or more judgments within a two-year period against the applicant or licensee for theft of identity as defined
    in section three hundred eighty-s of the general business law; or 2. One criminal conviction against the applicant or licensee for acts of identity theft or unlawful possession of personal identification information as defined in article one hundred
    ninety of the penal law; or 3. Two or more criminal convictions within a two-year period of any employees or associates of the applicant or licensee for acts of identity theft or unlawful possession of personal identification information as defined
    in article one hundred ninety of the penal law that are committed with the use of the applicant&#39;s or licensee&#39;s equipment, data, technology, or other similar resource. It shall be an affirmative defense that a applicant or licensee did not have reasonable
    grounds to believe the proscribed acts were taking place with the use of the licensee&#39;s equipment, data, technology, or other similar resource or that the proscribed acts were not taking place with the use of the applicant&#39;s or licensee&#39;s equipment,
    data, technology, or other similar resource.
