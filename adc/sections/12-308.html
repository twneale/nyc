Any order of the board of collective bargaining or the board of certification shall be (1) reviewable under article seventy-eight
    of the civil practice law and rules upon petition filed by an aggrieved party within thirty days after service by registered or certified mail of a copy of such order upon such party, and (2) enforceable by the supreme court in a special proceeding,
    upon petition of the board of collective bargaining, board of certification or any aggrieved party. b. If a proceeding by the board for enforcement of its order is instituted prior to the expiration of the period within which a party may seek judicial
    review of such order, the respondent may raise in his or her answer the questions authorized to be raised by section seven thousand eight hundred three of the civil practice law and rules and thereafter the proceedings shall be governed by the provisions
    of article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules that are not inconsistent herewith, except that if an issue specified in question four of section seven thousand eight hundred three of the civil practice law and rules is raised, the proceeding
    shall be transferred for disposition to the appellate division of the supreme court. Where an issue specified in question four of section seven thousand eight hundred three of the civil practice law and rules is raised, either in a proceeding to enforce
    or review an order of the board, the appellate division of the supreme court, upon completion of proceedings before it, shall remit a copy of its judgment or order to the court in which the proceeding was commenced, which court shall have the power
    to compel compliance with such judgment or order. c. In a proceeding to enforce or review an order of the board, the court shall have power to grant such temporary relief or restraining order as it deems just and proper, and to make and enter a judgment
    or decree enforcing, modifying and enforcing as so modified, or setting aside in whole or in part the order of the board.</span>
