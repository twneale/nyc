                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-526.html'>§ 11-526</a> Overpayment. (a) General. The commissioner of finance, within the applicable period of limitations, may credit an overpayment of tax and interest on such overpayment against any liability in respect of any tax imposed by this chapter or by
    chapters six, seventeen and nineteen of this title, on the person who made overpayment, and the balance shall be refunded. (b) Credits against estimated tax. The commissioner of finance may prescribe regulations providing for the crediting against
    the estimated tax for any taxable year of the amount determined to be an overpayment of the tax for a preceding taxable year. If any overpayment of tax is so claimed as a credit against estimated tax for the succeeding taxable year, such amount shall
    be considered as a payment of the tax for the succeeding taxable year (whether or not claimed as a credit in the declaration of estimated tax for such succeeding taxable year), and no claim for credit or refund of such overpayment shall be allowed
    for the taxable year for which the overpayment arises. (c) Rule where no tax liability. If there is no tax liability for a period in respect of which an amount is paid as tax, such amount shall be considered an overpayment. (d) Assessment and collection
    after limitation period. If any amount of income tax is assessed or collected after the expiration of the period of limitations properly applicable thereto, such amount shall be considered an overpayment. (e) Notwithstanding any provision of law in
    article fifty-two of the civil practice law and rules to the contrary, the procedures for the enforcement of money judgments shall not apply to the department of finance, or to any officer or employee of the department of finance, as a garnishee,
    with respect to any amount of money to be refunded or credited to a taxpayer under this chapter.</span>
