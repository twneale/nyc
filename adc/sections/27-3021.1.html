No public utility shall supply electricity to a one, two, three or four family residence building, nor shall such utility energize more electrical meters in a building than the number of distinct
    and separate residences in such building as authorized in the certificate of occupancy applicable thereto, or if there is no certificate of occupancy, as determined by the department, without first receiving a sign-off from the department. In the
    event that an owner of a one, two, three or four family building wants to install an additional electrical meter other than provided for herein, approval shall be obtained in writing from the department. A public utility shall not install such additional
    electrical meter without such approval. A building in which two or more dwelling units have been constructed in accordance with the certificate of occupancy, or if there is no certificate of occupancy, as determined by the department, may have one
    meter for each dwelling unit and one additional meter for the common areas of the building, provided that smoke detecting devices are installed in all common areas in accordance with departmental requirements. Such common areas may include boiler
    rooms, shared hallway lighting, shared stairway lighting, and outdoor perimeter lighting but shall not include any habitable space. In the event that a meter has been found to have been installed or to exist in violation of this section, the utility
    must report such findings to the department, which may take action leading to the disconnecting of such meter in accordance with the notice requirements set forth in <a href='/adc/sections/27-3020.html'>section 27-3020</a> of this code.</span>
