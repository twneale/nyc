Any person who violates the provisions of an order to vacate issued pursuant to <a href='//sections/15-227.html'>section 15-227</a> of this code shall be liable for a civil
    penalty of not more than twenty-five thousand dollars and an additional civil penalty of not more than one thousand dollars for each day the violation continues. b. Except as authorized by the commissioner, any person who removes or causes to be removed
    the seal from any premises sealed in accordance with an order of the commissioner or his or her designee shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for no more than one year or a fine not to exceed fifty thousand dollars, or both
    such fine and imprisonment. Such person shall also be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed fifty thousand dollars. c. The commissioner shall allow access to the premises to an owner, or a lessor, lessee or mortgagee, in accordance with the terms
    of the parties&#39; lease or mortgage agreement, upon the following conditions: (i) the submission of a written affirmation, satisfactory to the commissioner, that such person or persons will commence or cause to be commenced without delay all work necessary
    to correct the conditions stated in the vacate order or otherwise to make the premises suitable for a lawful use and will complete such work within a period of time and in a manner to be approved by the commissioner; (ii) the submission of an affirmation
    or other proof satisfactory to the commissioner describing the steps that have been taken and will be taken in the future to ensure that the premises will be used or operated in a lawful manner and specifying such lawful use; (iii) if a license, permit
    or certificate of occupancy is necessary for such lawful use, the submission of a written affirmation or other proof, satisfactory to the commissioner, describing the steps that have been taken and will be taken in the future to ensure that such premises
    will be used or operated in compliance with any law requiring such license, permit or certificate of occupancy; and (iv) if the premises are leased and the person making the affirmations described in items (i), (ii) and (iii) is not such lessee, the
    commissioner may also require any authorized person seeking access pursuant to this subdivision to submit an affirmation or other proof that proceedings to enable such person to take actions necessary to ensure compliance with the affirmations submitted
    by such authorized person pursuant to items (i), (ii) and (iii) have been commenced. d. Any person who makes a material false statement in any document submitted pursuant to subdivision c of this section which statement he or she knows or has reason
    to know will be relied upon by the commissioner in determining whether he or she will allow access to the premises shall be liable for a civil penalty of not more than fifty thousand dollars. e. Notwithstanding any other law, rule, or regulation,
    any person, corporation, partnership, association or any other legal entity who permits a building, structure or part thereof to be unlawfully occupied or used in contravention of an order of the commissioner pursuant to <a href='//sections/15-227.html'>section 15-227</a>, or who negligently
    fails to prevent or prohibit such unlawful occupancy or use, shall be liable for a civil penalty of not more than one million dollars, if any other person suffers serious physical injury, as defined in section ten of the penal law, or death in the
    building, structure or part thereof subject to such order, as a result of such unlawful occupancy or use. If more than one person suffers serious physical injury or death, such penalty shall be recoverable for each person suffering injury or death.
    Such penalty shall be recovered in a civil action brought by the corporation counsel in the name of the city in any court of competent jurisdiction. In determining the amount of the civil penalty to be imposed the court shall consider: (i) the extent
    and severity of injury to persons and property caused by the violation; (ii) the history of violations by the defendant at such premises, or any other premises, of laws, rules or regulations enforced by the department; (iii) the degree of willfulness,
    recklessness, or negligence displayed by the defendant in committing the subject violation; (iv) the defendant&#39;s financial resources; and (v) the defendant&#39;s good faith efforts to cure the subject violation, including efforts to obtain entry to or
    possession of the premises in order to do so. In the event that any person seriously injured or the family of any person who has died as the result of any unlawful occupancy or use described in this subdivision is unable to collect a judgment recovered
    in a civil action for personal injury or wrongful death against a defendant who has violated this subdivision because of the insolvency of such defendant, the city may, in its discretion, pay to such injured person or the family of such deceased person
    an amount, as hereinafter provided, collected from such defendant in an action relating to the same injury or death commenced by the corporation counsel against such defendant pursuant to this subdivision. Payments pursuant to this subdivision shall
    be made as a matter of grace and shall be in such amounts and in accordance with such standards and procedures as shall be established by the mayor, provided, however, that any payment made pursuant to this subdivision shall be in an amount not exceeding
    out-of-pocket expenses, including indebtedness reasonably incurred for medical or other services necessary as a result of the injury upon which such action is based; loss of earnings or support resulting from such injury; burial expenses not exceeding
    two thousand five hundred dollars of a person who died as a result of such unlawful occupancy or use described in this subdivision; and the unreimbursed cost of repair or replacement of articles of essential personal property lost, damaged or destroyed
    as a direct result of such unlawful occupancy or use. In no event shall the payment made to any person exceed the amount of such person&#39;s uncollected judgment for personal injury or wrongful death and in no event shall the total amount paid to any
    number of persons with such uncollected judgments against a single defendent exceed the actual amount collected by the city from such defendant in an action under this subdivision.
