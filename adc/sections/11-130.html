                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-130.html'>§ 11-130</a> Financial institution data match system for tax collection purposes. 1. Definitions. As used in this section: (a) &quot;Debt&quot; means all liabilities, including unpaid tax, interest, and penalty, that the commissioner of finance is required by law
    to collect and that have been reduced to judgment by the docketing of a city tax warrant in the office of the county clerk of the appropriate county. (b) &quot;Tax debtor&quot; means a natural person or any entity other than a natural person named on a city
    tax warrant and identified thereon as a judgment debtor. (c) &quot;Financial institution&quot; means any financial institution authorized or required to participate in a financial institution data match system or program for child support enforcement purposes
    under federal or state law. 2. Financial institution data match system for tax collection purposes. (a) To assist the commissioner of finance in the collection of debts, the department of finance shall develop and operate a financial institution data
    match system for the purpose of identifying and seizing the non-exempt assets of tax debtors as identified by the commissioner of finance. The commissioner is authorized to designate a third party to develop and operate this system. Any third party
    designated by the commissioner to develop and operate a financial data match system shall keep all information it obtains from both the department and the financial institution confidential, and any employee, agent or representative of that third
    party is prohibited from disclosing that information to anyone other than the department or the financial institution. (b) Each financial institution doing business in the state of New York shall, in conjunction with the commissioner or the commissioner&#39;s
    authorized designee, develop and operate a data match system to facilitate the identification and seizure of non-exempt financial assets of tax debtors identified by the commissioner or the commissioner&#39;s authorized designee. If a financial institution
    has a data match system developed or used to administer the child support enforcement programs of this state, and if that system is approved by the commissioner or the commissioner&#39;s authorized designee, the financial institution may use that system
    to comply with the provisions of this section. 3. Each financial institution shall provide identifying information each calendar quarter to the department of finance for each tax debtor identified by the department who or that maintains an account
    at the institution. The identifying information shall include the tax debtor&#39;s name, address, and social security number or other taxpayer identification number, and all account numbers and balances in each account. 4. A financial institution that
    complies with this section will not be liable under state or city law to any person for the disclosure of information to the commissioner or the commissioner&#39;s authorized designee, or any other action taken in good faith to comply with this section.
    5. Both the financial institution furnishing a report to the commissioner under this section and the commissioner&#39;s authorized designee are prohibited from disclosing to the tax debtor that the name of the tax debtor has been received from or furnished
    to the commissioner, unless authorized in writing by the commissioner to do so. A violation of this subdivision will result in the imposition of a civil penalty equal to the greater of one thousand dollars or the amount in the account of the person
    to whom the disclosure was made for each instance of unauthorized disclosure by the financial institution. That civil penalty can be assessed and collected under this code as if that penalty were tax. 6. A financial institution may disclose to its
    depositors or account holders that the department of finance has the authority to request certain identifying information on certain depositors or account holders under the financial institution data match system for city tax collection purposes.</span>
