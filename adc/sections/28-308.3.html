                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/adc/sections/28-308.3.html'>§ 28-308.3</a> Retro-commissioning required. The owner shall ensure that retro-commissioning is performed on the base building systems of a covered building prior to filing an energy efficiency report as required by this article. Except as otherwise provided
    in <a href='/adc/sections/28-308.7.html'>section 28-308.7</a>, retro-commissioning shall be performed by or under this supervision of a retro-commissioning agent in accordance with rules promulgated by the department. Such rules, at a minimum, shall ensure that sufficient analysis, corrections
    and testing have been done so that the base building systems meet the following criteria demonstrating efficient operation: 1. Operating protocols, calibration, and sequencing: 1.1. HVAC temperature and humidity set points and setbacks are appropriate
    and operating schedules reflect major space occupancy patterns and the current facility requirements. 1.2. HVAC sensors are properly calibrated. 1.3. HVAC controls are functioning and control sequences are appropriate for the current facility requirements.
    1.4. Loads are distributed equally across equipment when appropriate (i.e. fans, boilers, pumps, etc. that run in parallel). 1.5. Ventilation rates are appropriate for the current facility requirements. 1.6. System automatic reset functions are functioning
    appropriately, if applicable. 1.7. Adjustments have been made to compensate for oversized or undersized equipment so that it is functioning as efficiently as possible. 1.8. Simultaneous heating and cooling does not occur unless intended. 1.9. HVAC
    system economizer controls are properly functioning, if applicable. 1.10. The HVAC distribution systems, both air and water side, are balanced. 1.11. Light levels are appropriate to the task. 1.12. Lighting sensors and controls are functioning properly
    according to occupancy, schedule, and/or available daylight, where applicable. 1.13. Domestic hot water systems have been checked to ensure proper temperature settings. 1.14. Water pumps are functioning as designed. 1.15. System water leaks have been
    identified and repaired. 2. Cleaning and repair: 2.1. HVAC equipment (vents, ducts, coils, valves, soot bin, etc.) is clean. 2.2. Filters are clean and protocols are in place to replace, as appropriate. 2.3. Light fixtures are clean. 2.4. Motors,
    fans, and pumps, including components such as belts, pulleys, and bearings, are in good operating condition. 2.5. Steam traps have been replaced as required to maintain efficient operation, if applicable. 2.6. Manual overrides on existing equipment
    have been remediated. 2.7. Boilers have been tuned for optimal efficiency, if applicable. 2.8. Exposed hot and chilled water and steam pipes three (3) inches or greater in diameter with associated control valves are insulated in accordance with the
    standards of the New York city energy conservation code as in effect for new systems installed on or after July 1, 2010. 2.9. In all easily accessible locations, sealants and weather stripping are installed where appropriate and are in good condition.
    3. Training and documentation: 3.1. Permits for all HVAC, electrical and plumbing equipment are in order. 3.2. Critical operations and maintenance staff have received appropriate training, which may include labor/management training, on all major
    equipment and systems and general energy conservation techniques. 3.3. Operational and maintenance record keeping procedures (log books, computer maintenance records, etc.) have been implemented. 3.4. The following documentation is on site and accessible
    to the operators: the operations and maintenance manuals, if such manuals are still available from the manufacturer, the maintenance contracts, and the most recent retro-commissioning report. Exception: No retro-commissioning is required if the covered
    building has received certification under the LEED 2009 rating system for Existing Buildings published by the USGBC or other rating system for existing buildings, as determined by the department, within two years prior to the filing of the building&#39;s
    energy efficiency report and earned the LEED point for Existing Building Commissioning investigation and analysis and the LEED point for Existing Building Commissioning implementation.
