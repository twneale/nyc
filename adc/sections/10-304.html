                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/nyc/adc/sections/10-304.html'>§ 10-304</a> Certificates of registration. a. It shall be unlawful for any person to have in his or her possession any rifle or shotgun unless said person is the holder of a certificate of registration for such rifle or shotgun. b. It shall be unlawful
    for any person who is not a licensed dealer to dispose of any rifle or shotgun for which such person does not have a certificate of registration unless such person files with the police commissioner a declaration in duplicate, signed and affirmed
    by the declarant which shall list by caliber, make, model, manufacturer&#39;s name and serial number, or if none, any other distinguishing number or identification mark, of each rifle and shotgun possessed by the declarant. Upon receipt of acknowledgement
    of said declaration by the police commissioner, the declarant may lawfully sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of such rifles or shotguns to a licensed dealer or any other person legally permitted to purchase or take possession of such rifles or
    shotguns. Any willful or material omission or false statement shall be a violation of this section. c. Exhibition of certificate. Every person carrying a rifle or shotgun shall have on his or her person a certificate of registration valid for such
    weapon. Upon demand, the appropriate certificate shall be exhibited for inspection to any peace officer or police officer. Failure of any person to so exhibit his or her certificate shall be presumptive evidence that he or she is not duly authorized
    to possess such rifle or shotgun and may be considered by the police commissioner as cause for revocation or suspension or such person&#39;s permit. d. Revocation. The revocation of a rifle or shotgun permit shall automatically be deemed to be a revocation
    of all certificates of registration for rifles and shotguns held by the person whose permit has been revoked. e. Disposition of rifles and shotguns. No person lawfully in possession of a rifle or shotgun shall dispose of same except to a licensed
    dealer in firearms, licensed dealer in rifles and shotguns, the holder of a valid rifle and shotgun permit, an exempt person as enumerated in this chapter, or a non-resident of the city of New York not subject to the permit requirements of this chapter.
    Any person so disposing of a rifle or shotgun shall report the disposition on forms provided by the commissioner setting forth the rifle and shotgun permit number of both seller and purchaser, the make, caliber, type, model and serial number, if any,
    and if the seller is a licensed dealer the certificate of registration number, of all such rifles and shotguns. Such form shall be signed by both seller and purchaser and the original shall be forwarded to the police commissioner within seventy-two
    hours of the disposition, one copy shall be retained by the seller, another by the purchaser. 1. If the seller is a licensed dealer, he or she shall at the time of the sale issue a certificate of registration to the purchaser provided to the dealer
    for that purpose by the police commissioner and shall forward to the police commissioner the duplicate thereof, together with the report of disposition. 2. If the seller is not a licensed dealer, the police commissioner shall, if the purchaser&#39;s rifle
    permit is valid, issue the certificate of registration within ten days of the receipt by the police commissioner of the report of disposition. Pending receipt of the certificate, but in no event for any longer than fourteen days from the date of purchase,
    the copy of the report of disposition shall serve in lieu of the purchaser&#39;s certificate of registration. f. No fee shall be charged for a certificate of registration. g. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section concerning the transfer,
    receipt, acquisition, or any other disposition of a rifle or shotgun, a rifle and shotgun permit shall not be required for the passing of a rifle or shotgun upon the death of an owner, to his or her heir or legatee, whether the same be by testamentary
    bequest or by the laws of intestacy, except that the person who shall so receive or acquire said rifle or shotgun shall be subject to all other provisions of this chapter, provided further that if the heir or legatee of the owner of such rifle or
    shotgun does not qualify to possess same under this chapter, the rifle or shotgun may be possessed by the heir or legatee for the purpose of sale as otherwise provided herein for a period not exceeding one hundred eighty days or for such further limited
    period beyond the one hundred eighty days as may be approved by the commissioner, said extensions in no event to exceed a total of ninety days.
