Upon any such death, the officer in charge of the station-house in the police precinct in which such person died shall immediately notify the office of chief medical

    take possession of any portable objects which, in his or her opinion, may be useful in establishing the cause of death, and except as provided in subdivision c hereof, shall deliver them to the police department. b. The police officer detailed in
    such cases shall, in the absence of next of kin of the deceased person, take possession of all property of value found on such person, make an exact inventory thereof on his or her report, and deliver such property to the police department, which
