                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/adc/sections/11-1314.html'>§ 11-1314</a> Proceedings to recover tax. a. Whenever any person shall fail to pay any tax, penalty or interest imposed by this chapter as herein provided, the corporation counsel shall, upon the request of the commissioner of finance, bring or cause to
    be brought an action to enforce the payment of the same on behalf of the city in any court of the state of New York or of any other state or of the United States. If, however, the commissioner of finance in his or her discretion believes that a taxpayer
    subject to the provisions of this chapter is about to cease business, leave the state or remove or dissipate the assets out of which the tax, interest or penalties might be satisfied and that any such tax, interest or penalty will not be paid when
    due, he or she may declare such tax, interest or penalty to be immediately due and payable and may issue a warrant immediately. b. In addition to all other remedies for the collection of any taxes, penalties or interest due under the provisions of
    this chapter, the commissioner of finance may issue a warrant, directed to the city sheriff commanding the sheriff to levy upon and sell the real and personal property of the person liable for the tax which may be found within the city, for the payment
    of the amount thereof, with any penalties and interest and the cost of executing the warrant, and to return such warrant to the commissioner of finance and to pay to the commissioner the money collected by virtue thereof within sixty days after the
    receipt of such warrant. The city sheriff shall within five days after the receipt of the warrant file with the county clerk a copy thereof, and thereupon such clerk shall enter in the judgment docket the name of the person mentioned in the warrant
    and the amount of the taxes, penalty and interest for which the warrant is issued and the date when such copy is filed. Thereupon the amount of such warrant shall become a lien upon the title to and interest in real and personal property of the person
    against whom the warrant is issued. The city sheriff shall then proceed upon the warrant in the same manner and with like effect as that provided by law in respect to executions issued against property upon judgments of a court of record, and for
    services in executing the warrant the city sheriff shall be entitled to the same fees which he or she may collect in the same manner. In the discretion of the commissioner of finance a warrant of like terms, force and effect may be issued and directed
    to any officer or employee of the department of finance, and in the execution thereof such officer or employee shall have all the powers conferred by law upon sheriffs, but shall be entitled to no fee or compensation in excess of the actual expenses
    paid in the performance of such duty. If a warrant is returned not satisfied in full, the commissioner of finance may from time to time issue new warrants and shall have the same remedies to enforce the amount due thereunder as if the city had recovered
    judgment therefor and execution thereon had been returned unsatisfied. c. The commissioner of finance, if he or she finds that the interests of the city will not thereby be jeopardized, and upon such conditions as the commissioner of finance may require,
    may release any property from the lien of any warrant or vacate such warrant for unpaid taxes, additions to tax, penalties and interest filed pursuant to subdivision b of this section, and such release or vacating of the warrant may be recorded in
    the office of any recording officer in which such warrant has been filed. The clerk shall thereupon cancel and discharge as of the original date of docketing the vacated warrant.</span>
