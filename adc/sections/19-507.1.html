(1) On or after September 1, 1999, any taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver may attend a remedial or refresher course approved by the commission. Upon satisfactory
    completion of a commission-approved course by such driver, two points shall be deducted from the number of points assessed under the persistent violators program against his or her taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver&#39;s license. A taxicab or for-hire
    vehicle driver shall be eligible for a point reduction pursuant to this subdivision only once within the five-year period commencing on or after September 1, 1999. (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph one of this subdivision, any taxicab
    or for-hire vehicle driver may attend one remedial or refresher course approved by the commission between the effective date of this local law and August 31, 1999. Upon satisfactory completion of a commission-approved course by such driver two points
    shall be deducted from the number of points assessed under the persistent violators program against his or her taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver&#39;s license. (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs one or two of this subdivision, no point
    reduction shall affect any suspension or revocation action which may be taken by the commission pursuant to this program prior to the completion of the course and no taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver shall receive a point reduction unless attendance
    at the course is voluntary on the part of the driver. If the commission has no approved remedial or refresher course on the effective date of this subdivision, then a department of motor vehicles-approved course shall be deemed acceptable until such
    time as the commission approves a course. b. Any taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver who has been found guilty of violations of the commission&#39;s rules such that six or more points have been assessed against his or her taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver&#39;s
    license within any fifteen-month period and whose license has not been revoked shall have his or her taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver&#39;s license suspended for thirty days. The provisions of this subdivision shall apply only to violations issued on
    or after July 26, 1998. c. Any taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver who has been found guilty of violations of the commission&#39;s rules such that ten or more points have been assessed against his or her taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver&#39;s license within
    any fifteen-month period shall have his or her taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver&#39;s license revoked. The provisions of this subdivision shall apply only to violations issued on or after July 26, 1998. d. For the purposes of assessing points against
    the license of a taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver, where a taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver has been found guilty of multiple violations arising from a single enforcement action by an authorized enforcement agent, such driver shall be deemed guilty
    of the single violation having the highest point assessment. e. A taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver shall not be subject to an assessment of points against his or her taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver&#39;s license or the imposition of duplicate penalties
    where the same act is a violation under provisions of law other than commission rules and where such violations duplicate each other or are substantively the same and any such driver may be issued only one summons or notice of violation for such violation.
    Points assessed by the department of motor vehicles by reason of violations under the vehicle and traffic law may not be added to points assessed by the commission under this section for violations of commission rules. f. It shall be an affirmative
    defense that the act which formed the basis for the violation was beyond the control and influence of the taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver. g. Any violation issued to a taxicab driver or owner for meter-tampering shall be served on the licensee
    by personal delivery or by certified and regular mail within five calendar days of its issuance. The licensee shall have an opportunity to request a hearing before the commission or other administrative tribunal of competent jurisdiction within ten
    calendar days after receipt of any such notification. Upon request such hearing shall be scheduled within ten calendar days. If the tenth day falls on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday, the hearing may be held on the next business day. A decision shall
    be made with respect to any such proceeding within sixty calendar days after the close of the hearing. In the event such decision is not made within that time period, the license or medallion which is the subject of the proceeding shall be returned
    by the commission to the licensee and deemed to be in full force and effect until such determination is made. It shall be an affirmative defense to any violation for meter-tampering issued to a taxicab driver or owner that such person (i) did not
    know of or participate in the alleged meter-tampering and (ii) exercised due diligence to ensure that meter-tampering does not occur. h. For purposes of subdivision g of this section, examples of an owner&#39;s due diligence shall include, but are not
    limited to (1) giving to their drivers a clear warning that violations of the meter tampering rules will result in the immediate termination of any lease agreement, the reporting to the commission of driver tampering and the commission&#39;s probable
    revocation of the driver&#39;s taxicab driver&#39;s license, (2) including in any written lease agreement provisions containing the warnings against violation of meter tampering rules, (3) stamping warnings about the illegality of meter tampering on the trip
    cards issued to all drivers of an owner&#39;s taxicabs, (4) having management personnel or mechanics periodically check for proper odometer and meter mileage comparisons in order to determine if there are inappropriate disparities between the two sets
    of figures, (5) conducting periodic random inspections of the taxicab meter and its wiring for all of its taxicabs to detect any evidence of violation of the meter tampering rules and (6) having all of such owner&#39;s taxicabs inspected by a licensed
    meter shop once every commission inspection cycle.</span>
