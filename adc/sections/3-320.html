No action shall be commenced to recover damages under <a href='//sections/3-318.html'>section 3-318</a> until at least thirty days have elapsed since the demands, claim or claims, upon which such action is founded, were presented to the comptroller

    been paid to sue for and recover such award or compensation with interest and costs as so much money had and received to his or her use by the person or persons to whom the same shall have been so paid. In the following cases it shall be lawful for
    the city to pay an award to the commissioner of finance, to be secured, disposed of and invested as the supreme court shall direct when 1. the owners, parties or persons entitled thereto are (a) under a legal disability, or (b) absent from the city
    or 2. the owners, parties or persons entitled thereto (a) cannot be found after diligent search, or (b) are involved in a dispute as to their title to receive such awards. Such payment shall be as valid and effectual in all respects as if made to
