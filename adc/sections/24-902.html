                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/nyc/adc/sections/24-902.html'>§ 24-902</a> Definitions. For the purposes of this chapter the following terms shall mean: &quot;Applicant&quot; shall mean a person who has submitted a request to participate in the local brownfield cleanup program but is not yet an enrollee. &quot;Certificate of completion&quot;
    shall mean a written certificate that is issued by the office to an enrollee who has successfully investigated and remediated a local brownfield site to the satisfaction of the office. &quot;Change of use&quot; shall mean the transfer of title to all or part
    of a local brownfield site, change in management of a local brownfield site, the erection of any structure on the site, the creation of a park or other public or private recreational facility on the site, or any activity that is likely to disrupt
    or expose contamination or to increase direct human exposure to contamination; or any other conduct that will or may tend to significantly interfere with an ongoing or completed remedial program at such site and the continued ability to implement
    the engineering and institutional controls associated with such site. &quot;Community based organization&quot; shall mean a community based organization as defined in section 970-r of the general municipal law. &quot;Contaminant&quot; shall mean hazardous waste and/or
    petroleum. &quot;Contamination&quot; or &quot;contaminated&quot; shall mean the presence of a contaminant in any environmental media, including soil, surface water, groundwater, air, or indoor air. &quot;Declaration of covenants and restrictions&quot; shall mean controls on the
    use of a site that are listed on the deed and that seek to prevent potential exposure to any residual contamination remaining at the site. &quot;Delegated brownfield site&quot; shall mean any real property for which state or federal law requires the investigation
    or remediation, or a portion of an investigation or remediation, to be supervised and/or approved by a state and/or federal agency, but where such state and/or federal agency has expressly authorized in writing that such real property may be investigated
    and remediated under the city&#39;s supervision or according to a mutually agreed-upon form of supervised oversight, subject to any and all appropriate restrictions as may be required by law or agreed to by the parties. &quot;Director&quot; shall mean the director
    of the office of environmental remediation. &quot;Enrollee&quot; shall mean an applicant who has been accepted into the local brownfield cleanup program and has signed a local brownfield cleanup agreement. &quot;Hazardous waste&quot; shall mean a hazardous waste as defined
    in section 27-1301 of the environmental conservation law. &quot;Historic fill material&quot; shall mean non-indigenous material, deposited or disposed of to raise the topographic elevation of real property, which material may have been contaminated prior to
    emplacement, and is in no way connected with the subsequent operations at the location of the emplacement and which includes, without limitation, construction debris, dredge spoils, incinerator residue, demolition debris, coal ash, fly ash, and non-hazardous
    waste. &quot;Historic fill material&quot; does not include any material which is chemical production waste or waste from processing of metal or mineral ores, residues, slag or tailings. In addition, historic fill material does not include a municipal solid
    waste site built after nineteen hundred sixty two. &quot;Light to moderate levels of contamination&quot; shall mean detectable levels of contamination, the presence of which does not require an applicant or enrollee to conduct any mandatory, governmental-supervised
    investigation or remediation of the contamination under any state or federal law. &quot;Local brownfield site&quot; or &quot;site&quot; shall mean any real property within the city, the redevelopment or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence
    of light to moderate levels of contamination, or any real property that meets the definition of a delegated brownfield site, including, but not limited to, real property containing historic fill material and real property rejected from state programs
    on grounds that the environmental contamination is not sufficient to warrant state involvement. &quot;Local brownfield site&quot; or &quot;site&quot; shall not include real property: (1) containing discharges of petroleum, except as authorized by the state department
    of environmental conservation upon agreement with the office or by state law, (2) at the time of application to this program and pursuant to section 27-1305 of the environmental conservation law, listed in the state registry of inactive hazardous
    waste disposal sites and classified as either (i) causing or presenting an imminent danger of causing irreversible or irreparable damage to the public health or environment--immediate action required, or (ii) significant threat to the public health
    or environment--action required; (3) listed on the national priorities list pursuant to 42 U.S.C. section 9605; (4) subject to an enforcement action under title seven or nine of article twenty-seven of the environmental conservation law, except a
    treatment, storage or disposal facility subject to a permit; provided, that nothing herein contained shall be deemed to exclude from the scope of the term &quot;local brownfield site&quot; a hazardous waste treatment, storage or disposal facility having interim
    status according to regulations promulgated by the state department of environmental conservation; (5) subject to an order for cleanup pursuant to article twelve of the navigation law or pursuant to title ten of article seventeen of the environmental
    conservation law except such property shall not be deemed ineligible if it is subject to a stipulation agreement; or (6) subject to any other on-going city, state or federal environmental enforcement action related to the contamination which is at
    or emanating from the real property. &quot;Office&quot; shall mean the office of environmental remediation. &quot;Participant&quot; shall mean an enrollee who either: (1) was the owner of the local brownfield site at the time of disposal or discharge of contaminants,
    or (2) is otherwise a person responsible according to applicable principles of statutory or common law liability, unless such person&#39;s liability arises solely as a result of such person&#39;s ownership or operation of or involvement with the site subsequent
    to the disposal or discharge of contaminants. &quot;Petroleum&quot; shall mean oil or petroleum of any kind and in any form including, but not limited to, oil, petroleum, fuel oil, oil sludge, oil refuse, oil mixed with other wastes and crude oils, gasoline
    and kerosene. &quot;Remedial action work plan&quot; shall mean a written document providing for the development and implementation of a remedial program for contamination within the boundaries of the local brownfield site; provided, however, that a participant
    shall also be required to provide in the remedial action work plan for the development and implementation of a remedial program for contamination that has emanated from the local brownfield site. &quot;Remedial investigation report&quot; shall mean a report
    that fully characterizes the nature and extent of contamination at and/or emanating from a brownfield site. &quot;Site management&quot; shall mean the management of physical barriers and methods and non-physical means to limit human and environmental exposure
    to contamination at and/or emanating from a site, as well as the implementation of any necessary monitoring, reporting, certification and/or operation and maintenance of a remedy, after the issuance of a certificate of completion. &quot;Site management
    plan&quot; shall mean a written document providing for site management. &quot;Volunteer&quot; shall mean an enrollee other than a participant, including without limitation a person whose liability arises solely as a result of such person&#39;s ownership or operation
    of or involvement with the local brownfield site subsequent to the disposal or discharge of contaminants, provided, however, that such person exercises appropriate care with respect to contamination found at the site by taking reasonable steps to:
    (1) stop any continuing release; (2) prevent any threatened future release; and (3) prevent or limit human, environmental, or natural resource exposure to any previously released contamination.</span>
