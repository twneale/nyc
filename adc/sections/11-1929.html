                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/adc/sections/11-1929.html'>§ 11-1929</a> Limitations on credit or refund. (a) General. Claim for credit or refund of an overpayment of tax shall be filed by the taxpayer within three years from the time the return was filed or two years from the time the tax was paid, whichever of
    such periods expires the later, or if no return was filed, within two years from the time the tax was paid. If the claim is filed within the three year period, the amount of the credit or refund shall not exceed the portion of the tax paid within
    the three years immediately preceding the filing of the claim plus the period of any extension of time for filing the return. If the claim is not filed within the three year period, but is filed within the two year period, the amount of the credit
    or refund shall not exceed the portion of the tax paid during the two years immediately preceding the filing of the claim. Except as otherwise provided in this section, if no claim is filed, the amount of a credit or refund shall not exceed the amount
    which would be allowable if a claim had been filed on the date the credit or refund is allowed. (b) Extension of time by agreement. If an agreement under the provisions of paragraph two of subdivision (b) of <a href='/adc/sections/11-1925.html'>section 11-1925</a> of this subchapter (extending
    the period for assessment of tax) is made within the period prescribed in subdivision (a) of this section for the filing of a claim for credit or refund, the period for filing a claim for credit or refund, or for making credit or refund if no claim
    is filed, shall not expire prior to six months after the expiration of the period within which an assessment may be made pursuant to the agreement or any extension thereof. The amount of such credit or refund shall not exceed the portion of the tax
    paid after the execution of the agreement and before the filing of the claim or the making of the credit or refund, as the case may be, plus the portion of the tax paid within the period which would be applicable under subdivision (a) if a claim had
    been filed on the date the agreement was executed. (c) Notice of change or correction of federal or New York state income. If a taxpayer is required by <a href='/adc/sections/11-1922.html'>section 11-1922</a> of this chapter to report a change or correction in federal or New York state taxable
    income or self-employment income reported on his or her federal or New York state tax return, or to report an assessment or a change or correction which is treated in the same manner as if it were an overpayment for federal or New York state income
    tax purposes, or to file an amended return with the commissioner, claim for credit or refund of any resulting overpayment of tax shall be filed by the taxpayer within two years from the time the notice of such change or correction or such amended
    return was required to be filed with the commissioner. If the report or amended return required by <a href='/adc/sections/11-1922.html'>section 11-1922</a> of this chapter is not filed within the ninety day period therein specified, interest on any resulting refund or credit shall cease
    to accrue after such ninetieth day. The amount of such credit or refund shall not exceed the amount of the reduction in tax attributable to such federal or New York state change, correction or items amended on the taxpayer&#39;s amended federal or New
    York state income tax or self-employment tax return. This subdivision shall not affect the time within which or the amount for which a claim for credit or refund may be filed apart from this subdivision. (d) Failure to file claim within prescribed
    period. No credit or refund shall be allowed or made, except as provided in subdivision (e) of this section or subdivision (d) of <a href='/adc/sections/11-1932.html'>section 11-1932</a> of this subchapter after the expiration of the applicable period of limitation specified in this chapter
    unless a claim for credit or refund is filed by the taxpayer within such period. Any later credit shall be void and any later refund erroneous. No period of limitations specified in any other law shall apply to the recovery by a taxpayer of moneys
    paid in respect of taxes under this chapter. (e) Effect of petition to commissioner. If a notice of deficiency for a taxable year has been mailed to the taxpayer under <a href='/adc/sections/11-1923.html'>section 11-1923</a> of this subchapter and if the taxpayer files a timely petition
    with the commissioner under <a href='/adc/sections/11-1931.html'>section 11-1931</a> of this subchapter, the commissioner may determine that the taxpayer has made an overpayment for such year (whether or not the commissioner also determines a deficiency for such year). No separate claim
    for credit or refund for such year shall be filed, and no credit or refund for such year shall be allowed or made, except: (1) as to overpayments determined by a decision of the commissioner which has become final; (2) as to any amount collected in
    excess of an amount computed in accordance with the decision of the commissioner which has become final; (3) as to any amount collected after the period of limitation upon the making of levy for collection has expired; and (4) as to any amount claimed
    as a result of a change or correction described in subdivision (c) of this section. (f) Limit on amount of credit or refund. The amount of overpayment determined under subdivision (e) of this section shall, when the decision of the commissioner has
    become final, be credited or refunded in accordance with subdivision (a) of <a href='/adc/sections/11-1928.html'>section 11-1928</a> of this subchapter and shall not exceed the amount of tax which the commissioner determines as part of his or her decision was paid: (1) after the mailing
    of the notice of deficiency, or (2) within the period which would be applicable under subdivision (a), (b) or (c) of this section, if on the date of the mailing of the notice of deficiency a claim has been filed (whether or not filed) stating the
    grounds upon which the commissioner finds that there is an overpayment. (g) Early return. For purposes of this section, any return filed before the last day prescribed for the filing thereof shall be considered as filed on such last day, determined
    without regard to any extension of time granted the taxpayer. (h) Prepaid tax. For purposes of this section, any tax paid by the taxpayer before the last day prescribed for its payment, any tax withheld from the taxpayer during any calendar year,
    and any amount paid by the taxpayer as estimated tax for a taxable year shall be deemed to have been paid by the taxpayer on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the close of his or her taxable year with respect to which such amount constitutes
    a credit or payment. (i) Return and payment of withholding tax. Notwithstanding subdivision (g) of this section, for purposes of this section with respect to any withholding tax: (1) if a return for any period ending with or within a calendar year
    is filed before April fifteenth of the succeeding calendar year, such return shall be considered filed on April fifteenth of such succeeding calendar year; and (2) if a tax with respect to remuneration paid during any period ending with or within
    a calendar year is paid before April fifteenth of the succeeding calendar year, such tax shall be considered paid on April fifteenth of such succeeding calendar year. (j) Cross reference. For provision barring refund of overpayment credited against
    tax of a succeeding year, see subdivision (d) of <a href='/adc/sections/11-1928.html'>section 11-1928</a> of this subchapter.</span>
