                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/adc/sections/16-508.html'>§ 16-508</a> License application. a. An applicant for a license pursuant to this chapter shall submit an application in the form and containing the information prescribed by the commission. An application shall include, without limitation: (i) a list of
    the names and addresses of all principals of the applicant business, including any manager or other person who has policy or financial decision-making authority in the business; and (ii) a list of the names and job titles of all employees and prospective
    employees of the applicant business who are or will be engaged in the operation of the trade waste business; and (iii) such other information as the commission shall determine by rule will properly identify such employees and prospective employees.
    b. An applicant shall: (i) be fingerprinted by a person designated for such purpose by the commission and pay a fee to be submitted by the commission to the division of criminal justice services for the purposes of obtaining criminal history records;
    and (ii) provide to the commission, upon a form prescribed by the commission and subject to such minimum dollar thresholds and other reporting requirements established on such form, information for the purpose of enabling the commission to determine
    the good character, honesty and integrity of the applicant, including but not limited to: (a) a listing of the names and addresses of any person having a beneficial interest in the applicant, and the amount and nature of such interest; (b) a listing
    of the amounts in which such applicant is indebted, including mortgages on real property, and the names and addresses of all persons to whom such debts are owed; (c) a listing of such applicant&#39;s real property holdings or mortgage or other interest
    in real property held by such applicant other than a primary residence and the names and addresses of all co-owners of such interest; (d) a listing of mortgages, loans, and instruments of indebtedness held by such applicant, the amount of such debt,
    and the names and addresses of all such debtors; (e) the name and address of any business in which such applicant holds an equity or debt interest, excluding any interest in publicly traded stocks or bonds; (f) the names and addresses of all persons
    or entities from whom such applicant has received gifts valued at more than one thousand dollars in any of the past three years, and the name of all persons or entities (excluding any organization recognized by the Internal Revenue Service under section
    501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code) to whom such applicant has given such gifts; (g) a listing of all criminal convictions, in any jurisdiction, of the applicant; (h) a listing of all pending civil or criminal actions to which such applicant is
    a party; (i) a listing of any determination by a federal, state or city regulatory agency of a violation by such applicant of laws or regulations relating to the conduct of the applicant&#39;s business where such violation has resulted in the suspension
    or revocation of a permit, license or other permission required in connection with the operation of such business or in a civil fine, penalty, settlement or injunctive relief in excess of threshold amounts or of a type set forth in the rules of the
    commission; (j) a listing of any criminal or civil investigation by a federal, state, or local prosecutorial agency, investigative agency or regulatory agency, in the five year period preceding the application, wherein such applicant has: (A) been
    the subject of such investigation, or (B) received a subpoena requiring the production of documents or information in connection with such investigation; (k) a certification that the applicant has paid all federal, state, and local income taxes related
    to the applicant&#39;s business for which the applicant is responsible for the three tax years preceding the date of the application or documentation that the applicant is contesting such taxes in a pending judicial or administrative proceeding; (l) the
    name of any trade association in which the applicant is or has been a member or held a position and the time period during which such membership or position was held; (m) the names and addresses of the principals of any predecessor trade waste business
    of the applicant; and (n) such additional information concerning good character, honesty and integrity that the commission may deem appropriate and reasonable. An applicant may submit to the commission any material or explanation which the applicant
    believes demonstrates that any information submitted pursuant to subparagraphs (g), (h), (i), or (j) of this paragraph does not reflect adversely upon the applicant&#39;s good character, honesty and integrity. The commission may require that such applicants
    pay such fees to cover the expenses of fingerprinting and background investigations provided for in this subdivision as are set forth in the rules promulgated pursuant to <a href='/adc/sections/16-504.html'>section 16-504</a> of this chapter. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
    chapter, for purposes of this section: (A) in the case of an applicant which is a regional subsidiary of or otherwise owned, managed by or affiliated with a business that has national or international operations: (aa) (i) fingerprinting and disclosure
    under this section shall also be required of any persons not employed by the applicant who has direct management supervisory responsibility for the operations or performance of the applicant; and (ii) the chief executive officer, chief operating officer
    and chief financial officer, or any person exercising comparable responsibilities and functions, of any regional subsidiary or similar entity of such business over which any person subject to fingerprinting and disclosure under item (i) of this clause
    exercises similar responsibilities shall be fingerprinted and shall submit the information required pursuant to subparagraphs (g) and (h) of this paragraph, as well as such additional information pursuant to this paragraph as the commission may find
    necessary; and (bb) the listing specified under subparagraph (j) of this paragraph shall also be provided for any regional subsidiary or similar entity of the national or international business for which fingerprinting and disclosure by principals
    thereof is made pursuant to (aa) of this paragraph; and (B) &quot;predecessor trade waste business&quot; shall mean any business engaged in the removal, collection or disposal of trade waste in which one or more principals of the applicant were principals in
    the five year period preceding the application. For purposes of determining the good character, honesty and integrity of a business that removes, collects or disposes of trade waste, a trade waste broker or a business issued a registration by reason
    of the grant pursuant to <a href='/adc/sections/16-505.html'>section 16-505</a> of this chapter of an exemption from the requirement for a license, the term &quot;applicant&quot; shall apply to the business of such trade waste business, trade waste broker or exempt business and, except as specified
    by the commission, all the principals thereof; for purposes of investigations of employees or agents pursuant to <a href='/adc/sections/16-510.html'>section 16-510</a> of this chapter, the term &quot;applicant&quot; as used herein shall be deemed to apply to employees, agents or prospective employees
    or agents of an applicant for a license or a licensee. Notwithstanding any provision of this subdivision, the commission may accept, in lieu of submissions required pursuant to this subdivision, information, such as copies of submissions to any federal,
    state or local regulatory entity, where and to the extent that the commission finds that the contents of such submissions are sufficient or comparable to that required by this subdivision. c. A licensee shall, in accordance with rules promulgated
    by the commission pursuant to <a href='/adc/sections/16-504.html'>section 16-504</a> of this chapter, inform the commission of any changes in the ownership composition of the licensee, the addition or deletion of any principal at any time subsequent to the issuance of the license, membership
    in a trade association in addition to an association identified in the application submitted pursuant to this section, the arrest or criminal conviction of any principal of the business, or any other material change in the information submitted on
    the application for a license. A licensee shall provide the commission with notice of at least ten business days of the proposed addition of a new principal to the business of such licensee. The commission may waive or shorten such period upon a showing
    that there exists a bona fide business requirement therefor. Except where the commission determines within such period, based upon information available to it, that the addition of such new principal may have a result inimical to the purposes of this
    chapter, the licensee may add such new principal pending the completion of review by the commission. The licensee shall be afforded an opportunity to demonstrate to the commission that the addition of such new principal pending completion of such
    review would not have a result inimical to the purposes of this chapter. If upon the completion of such review, the commission determines that such principal lacks good character, honesty and integrity, the license shall cease to be valid unless such
    principal divests his or her interest, or discontinues his or her involvement in the business of such license, as the case may be, within the time period prescribed by the commission. d. Each applicant shall provide the commission with a business
    address in New York city where notices may be delivered and legal process served.
