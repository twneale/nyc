                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/adc/sections/11-2206.html'>§ 11-2206</a> Determination of tax. If a return required by this chapter is not filed or if a return when filed is incorrect or insufficient, or if a tax or any part thereof due hereunder be not paid when required, the amount of tax due shall be determined
    by the commissioner of motor vehicles or by the commissioner of finance if designated as his or her agent, from such information as may be obtainable, including motor vehicle registration with the department of motor vehicles of the state of New York
    and/or other factors. Notice of such determination shall be given to the person liable for the tax. Such a determination by the commissioner of motor vehicles shall finally and irrevocably fix the tax unless the person against whom it is assessed,
    within ninety days after the giving of notice of such determination, shall apply to the commissioner of motor vehicles for a hearing, or unless such commissioner of his or her own motion shall redetermine the same. If the commissioner of finance is
    designated as the agent of the commissioner of motor vehicles, such a determination by the commissioner of finance shall finally and irrevocably fix the tax unless the person against whom it is assessed, within ninety days after the giving of such
    determination, or, if the commissioner of finance has established a conciliation procedure pursuant to <a href='/adc/sections/11-124.html'>section 11-124</a> of the code and the taxpayer has requested a conciliation conference in accordance therewith, within ninety days from the mailing
    of a conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner&#39;s confirmation of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding, both (1) serves a petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2) applies to the tax appeals tribunal for a hearing by
    filing a petition, or unless the commissioner of finance of his or her own motion shall redetermine the same. A hearing following a petition to the tax appeals tribunal and any appeal to the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc from the decision rendered
    in such hearing shall be conducted in the manner and subject to the requirements prescribed by the tax appeals tribunal pursuant to sections one hundred sixty-eight through one hundred seventy-two of the charter. After such hearing by the commissioner
    of motor vehicles or the tax appeals tribunal, the commissioner of motor vehicles, if he or she holds the hearing, or the tax appeals tribunal if the tax appeals tribunal holds the hearing, shall give notice of the determination or decision to the
    person against whom the tax is assessed and in the case of a tax appeals tribunal decision, to the commissioner of finance. Such determination by the commissioner of motor vehicles, or a decision of the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc shall be
    reviewable for error, illegality or unconstitutionality or any other reason whatsoever by a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules if application therefor is made to the supreme court by the person against whom
    the tax was assessed within four months after the giving of the notice of such determination or tax appeals tribunal decision. A proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules shall not be instituted by a taxpayer unless
    (a) the amount of any tax sought to be reviewed, with penalties and interest thereon, if any, shall be first deposited with the commissioner of motor vehicles and there shall be filed with the commissioner of motor vehicles an undertaking, issued
    by a surety company authorized to transact business in this state and approved by the superintendent of insurance of this state as to solvency and responsibility, in such amount as a justice of the supreme court shall approve, to the effect that if
    such proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the taxpayer will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of the proceeding; or (b) at the option of the taxpayer such undertaking filed with the commissioner of motor vehicles
    may be in a sum sufficient to cover the taxes, penalties and interest thereon stated in such determination or decision, plus the costs and charges which may accrue against it in the prosecution of the proceeding, in which event the taxpayer shall
    not be required to deposit such taxes, penalties and interest as a condition precedent to the application.</span>
