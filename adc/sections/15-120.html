It shall be the duty of the commissioner to make suitable regulations under which the officers and members of the department shall be required to wear an appropriate uniform and badge by which
    the authority and relations of the officers and members in such department may be known. The commissioner shall select the grade of cloth and quality required for such uniforms, but shall not prescribe where or from whom such uniforms or uniform clothing
    shall be purchased, or the price to be paid therefor. It shall be unlawful for any contractor or agent or employee of any contractor for the making of uniforms for the department to have an office within any building belonging to or under the control
    of the department. b. It shall be a misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment for a period of not less than sixty days, for a person not enrolled or employed, or appointed by the department, to wear the whole or any part of the uniform or insignia prescribed
    to be worn by the rules or regulations of the department, or to do any act as firefighter not duly authorized by the commissioner, or to interfere with the property or apparatus of the department in any manner unless by the authority of the commissioner.
    Any person who shall falsely represent any member of the uniformed force of the department, or who shall maliciously, with intent to deceive, use, or imitate any of the signs, fire caps, badges, signals or devices adopted or used by the department,
    shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be subject to a fine of not less than twenty-five dollars or more than two hundred fifty dollars, and to imprisonment for a term of not less than ten days, or more than three months, such fine when
    collected to be paid into the general fund of the city established pursuant to section one hundred nine of the charter.</span>
