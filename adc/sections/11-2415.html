Except in accordance with proper judicial order, or as otherwise provided by law, it shall be unlawful for the commissioner, the tax appeals tribunal or any officer or employee of the city to divulge or make known
    in any manner any information relating to the business of a taxpayer contained in any return required under this chapter. The officers charged with the custody of such returns shall not be required to produce any of them or evidence of anything contained
    in them in any action or proceeding in any court, except on behalf of the commissioner in an action or proceeding under the provisions of this chapter, or on behalf of any party to any action or proceeding under the provisions of this chapter when
    the returns or facts shown thereby are directly involved in such action or proceeding, in either of which events the court may require the production of, and may admit in evidence, so much of said returns or of the facts shown thereby, as are pertinent
    to the action or proceeding and no more. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the delivery to a taxpayer or the taxpayer&#39;s duly authorized representative of a certified copy of any return filed in connection with his or her tax nor to prohibit
    the publication of statistics so classified as to prevent the identification of particular returns and the items thereof, or the inspection by the corporation counsel or other legal representatives of the city, or by the district attorney of any county
    within the city, of the return of any taxpayer who shall bring action to set aside or review the tax based thereon, or against whom an action or proceeding under this chapter may be instituted. Returns shall be preserved for three years and thereafter
    until the commissioner permits them to be destroyed. (b) (1) Any officer or employee of the city who willfully violates the provisions of subdivision (a) of this section shall be dismissed from office and be incapable of holding any public office
    in this city for a period of five years thereafter. (2) Cross-reference: For criminal penalties, see chapter forty of this title. (c) This section shall be deemed a state statute for purposes of paragraph (a) of subdivision two of section eighty-seven
    of the public officers law. d. Notwithstanding anything in subdivision a of this section to the contrary, if a taxpayer has petitioned the tax appeals tribunal for administrative review as provided in section one hundred seventy of the charter, the
    commissioner of finance shall be authorized to present to the tribunal any report or return of such taxpayer, or any information contained therein or relating thereto, which may be material or relevant to the proceeding before the tribunal. The tax
    appeals tribunal shall be authorized to publish a copy or a summary of any decision rendered pursuant to section one hundred seventy-one of the charter.</span>
