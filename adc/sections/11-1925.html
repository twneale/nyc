                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/adc/sections/11-1925.html'>§ 11-1925</a> Limitations on assessment. (a) General. Except as otherwise provided in this section, any tax under this chapter shall be assessed within three years after the return was filed (whether or not such return was filed on or after the date prescribed).
    (b) Exceptions. (1) Assessment at any time. The tax may be assessed at any time if: (A) no return is filed, (B) a false or fraudulent return is filed with intent to evade tax, or (C) the taxpayer fails to comply with <a href='/adc/sections/11-1922.html'>section 11-1922</a> of this chapter
    in not reporting a change or correction increasing his or her federal or New York state taxable income or self-employment income as reported on the taxpayer&#39;s federal or New York state tax return, or the execution of a notice of waiver and the changes
    or corrections on which it is based or in not reporting an assessment or a change or correction which is treated in the same manner as if it were a deficiency for federal or New York state income tax purposes, or in not filing an amended return. (2)
    Extension by agreement. Where, before the expiration of the time prescribed in this section for the assessment of tax, both the commissioner and the taxpayer have consented in writing to its assessment after such time, the tax may be assessed at any
    time prior to the expiration of the period agreed upon. The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period previously agreed upon. (3) Report of changed or corrected federal or New
    York state income. If the taxpayer shall, pursuant to <a href='/adc/sections/11-1922.html'>section 11-1922</a> of this chapter, report a change or correction or file an amended return increasing the taxpayer&#39;s federal or New York state taxable income or earnings from self-employment or report
    an assessment or a change or correction which is treated in the same manner as if it were a deficiency for federal or New York state income tax purposes, the assessment (if not deemed to have been made upon the filing of the report or amended return)
    may be made at any time within two years after such report or amended return was filed. The amount of such assessment of tax shall not exceed the amount of the increase in city tax on earnings attributable to such federal or New York state change
    or correction. The provisions of this paragraph shall not affect the time within which or the amount for which an assessment may otherwise be made. (4) Recovery of erroneous refund. An erroneous refund shall be considered an underpayment of tax on
    the date made, and an assessment of a deficiency arising out of an erroneous refund may be made at any time within two years from the making of the refund, except that the assessment may be made within five years from the making of the refund if it
    appears that any part of the refund was induced by fraud or misrepresentation of a material fact. (5) Request for prompt assessment. If a return is required for a decedent or for the decedent&#39;s estate during the period of administration, the tax shall
    be assessed within eighteen months after written request therefor (made after the return is filed) by the executor, administrator or other person representing the estate of such decedent, but not more than three years after the return was filed, except
    as otherwise provided in this subdivision and subdivision (c) of this section. (c) Omission of income on return. The tax may be assessed at any time within six years after the return was filed if a taxpayer omits from a return an amount properly includible
    therein which is in excess of twenty-five per centum of the amount of the gross income derived by the taxpayer from any trade or business. For purposes of this subdivision there shall not be taken into account any amount which is omitted in the return
    if such amount is disclosed in the return, or in a statement attached to the return, in a manner adequate to apprise the commissioner of the nature and amount of such item. (d) Suspension of running of period of limitation. The running of the period
    of limitations on or collection of tax or other amount (or of a transferee&#39;s liability) shall, after the mailing of a notice of deficiency, be suspended for the period during which the commissioner is prohibited under subdivision (c) of <a href='/adc/sections/11-1923.html'>section 11-1923</a>
    of this subchapter collecting by levy or proceeding in court.</span>
