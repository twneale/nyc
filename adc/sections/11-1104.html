                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/adc/sections/11-1104.html'>§ 11-1104</a> Returns; requirements as to. a. Except as otherwise provided in subdivision e of this section with respect to taxable periods beginning after nineteen hundred ninety-eight, on or before the twenty-fifth day of September, nineteen hundred sixty-five,
    and on or before the twenty-fifth day of every month thereafter, every person subject to tax hereunder shall file a return with the commissioner of finance on a form to be prescribed by such commissioner. Such return shall state the gross income or
    gross operating income as the case may be for the preceding calendar month, and shall contain any other data, information or other matter which the commissioner of finance may require to be included therein. The commissioner of finance may require
    at any further time a supplemental return hereunder, which shall contain any data upon such matters as such commissioner may specify. Notwithstanding the foregoing and notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision e of this section, a vendor of utility
    services, all of whose gross operating income is excluded from the measure of the tax imposed by this chapter pursuant to subdivision e of <a href='/adc/sections/11-1102.html'>section 11-1102</a> of this chapter during any taxable period, shall not be required to file a return for such taxable
    period, provided, however, that on or before the first day of September of each year, any such vendor of utility services who was not required to file a return for any taxable period during the period covered by the statement required to be filed
    by such date pursuant to subdivision a of <a href='/adc/sections/11-208.1.html'>section 11-208.1</a> of this title shall file an information return covering such period in such form and containing such information as the commissioner of finance may specify. b. The commissioner of finance
    may require amended returns to be filed within twenty days after notice and to contain the information specified in the notice. c. If a return required by this chapter is not filed or if a return when filed is incorrect or insufficient on its face,
    the commissioner of finance shall take the necessary steps to enforce the filing of such return or of a corrected return. d. Where the state tax commission changes or corrects a taxpayer&#39;s sales and compensating use tax liability with respect to the
    purchase or use of items for which a sales or compensating use tax credit against the tax imposed by this chapter was claimed, the taxpayer shall report such change or correction to the commissioner of finance within ninety days of the final determination
    of such change or correction, or as required by the commissioner of finance, and shall concede the accuracy of such determination or state wherein it is erroneous. Any taxpayer filing an amended return or report with the state tax commission relating
    to the purchase or use of such items shall also file within ninety days thereafter a copy of such amended return or report with the commissioner of finance. e. With respect to taxable periods beginning after nineteen hundred ninety-eight, notwithstanding
    the provisions of subdivision a of this section, if the amount of tax imposed hereunder on any person in the base year does not exceed one hundred thousand dollars, the taxable period for which such person is required to file a return is the semiannual
    period described in paragraph i of subdivision fourteen of <a href='/adc/sections/11-1101.html'>section 11-1101</a> of this chapter, and such person shall file a return for each semiannual period of the first calendar year beginning after the base year on or before the twenty-fifth day of
    the month following the end of each such taxable period. Such return shall be filed with the commissioner of finance on a form to be prescribed by such commissioner. Such return shall state the gross income or gross operating income as the case may
    be for the preceding taxable period and shall contain any other data, information or other matter which the commissioner of finance may require to be included therein. The commissioner of finance may require at any further time a supplemental return
    hereunder, which shall contain any data upon such matters as such commissioner may specify. For the purposes of this subdivision, if the amount of tax imposed hereunder on such person in the base year is for a period of less than one year, the amount
    of tax imposed on such person shall be annualized by multiplying the amount of tax imposed by a fraction, the denominator of which is the number of months or parts thereof during which the person was subject to the tax imposed hereunder and the numerator
    of which is twelve. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subdivision, a person that first becomes subject to the tax hereunder shall file a return for each month in the calendar year in which such person first becomes subject to such tax
    in accordance with subdivision a of this section.</span>
