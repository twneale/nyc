                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/adc/sections/19-508.html'>§ 19-508</a> Meters, radios and other equipment. a. All taxicabs shall be equipped with meters, and the equipment which shall store or transmit for storage fare data, including, but not limited to, the rate of fare and the times or locations such rate of
    fares were in effect, pick up and drop-off information and any other data as required by the commission. All data required to be stored or transmitted by such equipment shall be made available to the commission in a form and manner as required by
    the commission. A licensed driver&#39;s fare information, including rate of fare and pickup and drop-off information shall be made available to such driver as required by the commission, at no charge to such drivers. The commission shall prescribe by
    rule, contract or otherwise, responsibility for compliance with the provisions of this section, and for penalties for non-compliance with such provisions. The commission may permit or require other licensed vehicles to be equipped with the same or
    different types of meters. b. The commission may permit or require the installation of radio or other equipment of specified types in licensed vehicles, except that the commission shall require that all wheelchair accessible vans contain two-way radios
    where the owner employs a dispatcher, a number of portable or fixed seat belts equal to the maximum capacity of the van, safety ties sufficient to secure any wheelchair or wheelchairs which the van may at any given time be transporting and such other
    special equipment as the commission shall determine is necessary to insure the safe transportation of physically handicapped persons. The commission shall require the use of a specified frequency for any radio used by licensed vehicles, said frequency
    to be assigned by the federal communications commission. c. 1. For purposes of this section, the term &quot;trouble light&quot; shall mean a help or distress signaling light system consisting of two turn signal type &quot;lollipop&quot; lights. 2. Every for-hire vehicle
    or taxicab placed into operation shall carry a minimum of two spare turn signal type &quot;lollipop&quot; lights of a type approved by the commission. In the event that any authorized enforcement agent indicates to a for-hire vehicle or taxicab driver that
    the vehicle&#39;s trouble light is defective, such driver shall have the opportunity to return such defective trouble light to proper working order by replacing one or both bulbs, or by any other corrective action, in the presence of such enforcement
    agent. If the replacement of a bulb or bulbs, or any other corrective action, restores the trouble light to proper working order, no summons or notice of violation may be issued for operating a for-hire vehicle or taxicab with a defective trouble
    light. In the event that repair of the defective condition is not made in the presence of such enforcement agent and a summons or notice of violation is issued for a defective for-hire vehicle or taxicab trouble light, such summons or notice of violation
    shall be dismissed by the adjudicatory body before which such summons or notice of violation is heard if: (a) proof that repair of such defect was made within twenty-four hours of the issuance of the summons or notice of violation is provided to the
    adjudicatory body and (b) the vehicle was not used for hire during the period of time from when the summons or notice of violation was issued to the time the repair was made. 3. Any person found to have violated the provisions of this subdivision
    shall be liable for a fine of one hundred seventy-five dollars for each such violation and in addition thereto the license for such vehicle shall be suspended until the defective condition is corrected.
