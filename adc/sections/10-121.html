    is issued for breach of the provisions of <a href='//sections/10-119.html'>section 10-119</a> or 10-120 of the code and sets forth thereon civil penalties only, such process shall be returnable to the environmental control board, which shall have the power to impose the civil penalties
    of not less than seventy five dollars nor more than one hundred fifty dollars for the first offense and not less than one hundred fifty dollars nor more than two hundred fifty dollars for the second and each subsequent offense within a twelve month
