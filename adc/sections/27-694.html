                    <span class="" style=""><a href='//sections/27-694.html'>§ 27-694</a> Capping and bracing of piles. (a) Capping of piles. (1) EMBEDMENT. Tops of all piles shall be embedded at least three inches in concrete caps. Such concrete shall conform to the provisions of article five of subchapter ten of this chapter and
    shall extend at least four inches beyond the edge of all piles. Alternatively, and only where the piles project above the future grade and will be readily accessible for visual inspection at all times, the tops of the piles may be capped with timber
    or steel caps, which shall be connected to the piles. Cap plates will not be required for steel H piles embedded in a reinforced concrete cap. Inspection of pile caps shall be as required in <a href='//sections/27-722.html'>section 27-722</a> of article thirteen of this subchapter. (2)
    UPLIFT. Where piles are subject to uplift, they shall be anchored into the cap to resist at least one and one-half times the amount of such uplift without exceeding the basic allowable stresses as established in subchapter ten. (3) REINFORCEMENT.
    Reinforcement shall be placed to provide at least three inches of clear cover, measured to the surface of the pile cap that is in contact with the ground. All reinforcement adjacent to timber or concrete piling shall have a minimum of one inch of
    concrete protection. Reinforcement shall extend to within four inches of the edges of the pile cap. (4) DESIGN. Except as modified above, concrete pile caps shall be designed in accordance with the provisions of reference standard RS 10-3. (b) Bracing
    of piles. Except for short piles as described in subdivision (c) of this section, every pile shall be laterally braced to conform with one or more of the following provisions: (1) RIGID CAP. Three or more piles connected by a rigid cap shall be considered
    as being braced provided that the piles are located in radial directions from the centroid of the group not less than sixty degrees apart (within a tolerance of three inches in location of the pile.) A two-pile group, in a rigid cap, shall be considered
    to be braced along the axis connecting the two piles. (2) BRACE BEAMS. Piles may be braced by the use of brace beams or ties rigidly connecting to at least two other piles in radial directions not less than sixty degrees nor more than one hundred
    twenty degrees apart. Concrete brace beams shall have minimum dimensions of one-twentieth of the clear distance between pile caps, but not less than eight inches. All brace beams shall be proportioned to resist a minimum axial load equal to three
    per cent of the total axial load capacity of the piles that are to be braced by that beam, plus the moment due to any eccentricity between the centroid of the pile group and the line of action of the applied load. Where underlain by soil of class
    9-65, 10-65 or 11-65, brace beams shall be proportioned to support the weight of soil, slab-on-ground, and live load on the slab-on-ground that is contained within vertical planes projected upward from the lateral limits of the brace beam. The design
    of brace beams to resist these loads shall conform to the provision of subchapter ten of this chapter. (3) CONCRETE SLAB-ON-GRADE. A continuous concrete slab or mat on grade, that is five inches or more in thickness and reinforced, and that extends
    at least forty feet in each direction and is anchored to the pile caps (or in which the piles are embedded at least three inches), may be used in lieu of brace beams for bracing of pile caps, providing that the slab is supported on material having
    an allowable bearing pressure of one and one-half tons per square foot or better and such material is not underlain by nominally unsatisfactory bearing materials. (4) OTHER MEANS. Piles may be braced by anchors, anchor wall, or other means acceptable
    to the commissioner. (5) FLOOR SYSTEM. Single-pile or two-pile groups or a single line of piles may be considered to be adequately braced if connected to, and braced by, a self supporting floor system provided: (1) that the details and dimensions
    of the floor and the wall or pier are of adequate strength to resist lateral displacement of the pile cap under conditions of maximum eccentricity of the applied load; and (2) that the wall or pier is braced until connection of the floor framing is
    made and the flooring (or slab) is in place. (6) SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BRACING BATTER PILES. The provisions of paragraphs one through five of this subdivision above shall apply. In addition, provisions shall be made to oppose the lateral thrust
    resulting from the pile inclination. (c) Bracing of short piles. (1) All pile caps supported by piles that penetrate less than ten feet below cutoff level or less than ten feet below ground level shall be braced against lateral movement. Such bracing
    may consist of connection to other pile caps that encompass piles embedded more than ten feet below those levels; the use of suitable anchors, connection to a slab-on-grade or the floor system as described in paragraphs three and five of subdivision
    (b) of this section, or by other equivalent means. The heads of the piles shall be fixed in the cap. In no event shall more than fifty percent of the piles in the foundation of any building penetrate less than ten feet below cut-off-level or less
    than ten feet below ground level. (2) Where the embedded length of piles located near a lot line would be reduced to less than ten feet by excavation of the adjacent site to a depth of ten feet below the nearest established curb level, the provisions
    of paragraph one of this subdivision shall apply.</span>
