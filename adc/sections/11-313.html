The term &quot;metered premises&quot; shall mean premises, or any part thereof, (a) to which water is supplied by the municipal water supply system or by a private water
    company, and (b) at which the quantity of water supplied is measured by a water meter. 2. The term &quot;unmetered premises&quot; shall mean premises, or any part thereof, (a) to which water is supplied by the municipal water supply system or by a private water
    company, and (b) at which the quantity of water supplied is not measured by a water meter. b. The sewer rents charged against metered premises in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs two and three of subdivision b of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/24-514.html'>section 24-514</a> of the
    code and the rules duly promulgated pursuant to such section, including the minimum rents for the use of the sewer system, charged pursuant to such section and rules, and the sewer rents charged against any premises in accordance with the provisions
    of paragraphs four and five of subdivision b of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/24-514.html'>section 24-514</a> of the code and rules duly promulgated pursuant to such section, including the minimum rents for the use of the sewer system, charged pursuant to such section and rules shall become due
    and shall become a charge or lien on the premises when the amount thereof shall have been fixed by the commissioner of environmental protection, and an entry thereof shall have been made against such premises with the date of such entry, in the book
    in which sewer rents are to be entered. The sewer surcharges charged against any premises pursuant to <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/24-523.html'>section 24-523</a> of the code shall become due and shall become a charge or lien on the premises when the amount thereof shall have been fixed by the
    commissioner of environmental protection and an entry thereof shall have been made against such premises in the book in which sewer surcharges are to be entered. A notice thereof, stating the amount due and the nature of the rent, surcharge or charge
    shall be mailed, within five days after such entry, to the last known address of the person whose name appears upon the records in the office of the department of finance as being the owner, occupant or agent or, where no name appears, to the premises
    addressed to either the owner or the occupant. If such rent, surcharge or charge shall have been entered on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred seventy-six but not paid on or before the last day of the month following the month of entry,
    it shall be the duty of the commissioner of finance or his or her designee to charge, collect and receive interest thereon to be calculated at the rate of seven percent per annum from the date of entry to December thirty-first, nineteen hundred seventy-six,
    and at the rate of fifteen percent per annum from January first, nineteen hundred seventy-seven to the date of payment; if entered on or after January first, nineteen hundred seventy-seven but not paid on or before the thirtieth day following the
    date of entry, it shall be the duty of the commissioner of finance or his or her designee to charge, collect and receive interest thereon to be calculated at the rate of fifteen percent per annum from the date of entry to the date of payment. The
    rents or charges for the use of the sewer system charged during any specified period of time pursuant to the provisions of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/24-514.html'>section 24-514</a> of the code and the rules promulgated thereunder shall be computed, in accordance with the provisions of such
    section and the rules duly promulgated thereunder, on the basis of water rents or charges computed for the same period. c. Sewer rents charged against unmetered premises in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs two and three of subdivision
    b of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/24-514.html'>section 24-514</a> of the code and the rules duly promulgated pursuant to such section, for the use of the sewer system during the one-year period commencing on the first day of July of each year, shall be due and payable and shall become a charge
    or lien on the premises on the first day of January following such first day of July, if entered, except that commencing on June thirtieth, nineteen hundred seventy-four such sewer rents shall be due and payable in advance on the thirtieth day of
    June in each year, if entered, and shall become a charge or lien on the premises on such date. If any of such rents or charges which became due and payable on or before June thirtieth, nineteen hundred seventy-six shall not have been paid to the commissioner
    of finance or his or her designee within thirty days after such first day of January, or, commencing on the thirtieth day of June, nineteen hundred seventy-four, on or before the last day of the month following the month of entry, it shall be the
    duty of the commissioner of finance or his or her designee to charge, collect and receive interest thereon to be calculated at the rate of seven percent per annum from the date when such charges became due and payable to December thirty-first, nineteen
    hundred seventy-six, and at the rate of fifteen percent per annum from January first, nineteen hundred seventy-seven to the date of payment. If any of such rents or charges which shall become due and payable on or after June thirtieth, nineteen hundred
    seventy-seven are not paid to the commissioner of finance or his or her designee on or before the last day of the month following the month of entry, it shall be the duty of the commissioner of finance or his or her designee to charge, collect and
    receive interest thereon to be calculated at the rate of fifteen percent per annum from the date when such rents or charges became due and payable to the date of payment. If not so entered and payable, but entered at any time subsequent thereto, they
    shall be due and payable and shall become a charge or lien on the premises when entered and notice thereof shall be mailed within five days after such entry, to the last known address of the person whose name appears upon the records in the department
    of finance as the owner or the occupant or if no name appears, to the premises addressed to either the owner or occupant. If any of such rents or charges which were entered on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred seventy-six but not paid
    on or before the last day of the month following the month of entry, it shall be the duty of the commissioner of finance or his or her designee to charge, collect and receive interest thereon to be calculated at the rate of seven percent per annum
    from the date of entry to December thirty-first, nineteen hundred seventy-six, and at the rate of fifteen percent per annum from January first, nineteen hundred seventy-seven to the date of payment; if entered on or after January first, nineteen hundred
    seventy-seven but not paid on or before the last day of the month following the month of entry, it shall be the duty of the commissioner of finance or his or her designee to charge, collect and receive interest thereon to be calculated at the rate
    of fifteen percent per annum from the date of entry to the date of payment. The sewer rents charged against unmetered premises for the use of the sewer system during the one-year period commencing on the first day of July of each year shall be computed
    in accordance with the provisions of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/24-514.html'>section 24-514</a> of the code and the rules duly promulgated thereunder, upon the basis of water rents or charges computed for the same period. d. Whenever an increase in the amount of the sewer rent charged against
    unmetered premises shall have been made or a charge shall have been made for sewer services for any building completed subsequent to the first day of July in each year, the amount of such increase of the charge or new charge for such new building
    shall not be due or become a lien or charge against the premises until the amounts thereof shall have been entered with the date of such entries, respectively, in the books in which sewer rents charged against such premises are to be entered. e. No
    later than the twenty-fifth day of May in each year, the banking commission shall transmit a written recommendation to the council of a proposed interest rate to be charged for nonpayment of sewer rents. In making such recommendations the commission
    shall consider the prevailing interest rates charged for commercial loans extended to prime borrowers by commercial banks operating in the city and shall propose a rate of at least six per centum per annum greater than such rates. The council may
    by resolution adopt an interest rate to be charged for nonpayment of sewer rents pursuant to <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-224.html'>section 11-224</a> of the code and, for nonpayment of sewer rents that become due and payable on or after July first, two thousand five, pursuant to <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-224.1.html'>section 11-224.1</a>
    of the code, and may specify in such resolution the date on which such interest rate is to take effect.
