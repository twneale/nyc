                    <span class="" style="">* <a href='/adc/sections/26-504.3.html'>§ 26-504.3</a> High income rent deregulation. (a) 1. For purposes of this section, annual income shall mean the federal adjusted gross income as reported on the New York state income tax return. Total annual income means the sum of the annual incomes
    of all persons whose names are recited as the tenant or co-tenant on a lease who occupy the housing accommodation and all other persons that occupy the housing accommodation as their primary residence on other than a temporary basis, excluding bona
    fide employees of such occupants residing therein in connection with such employment and excluding bona fide subtenants in occupancy pursuant to the provisions of section two hundred twenty-six-b of the real property law. In the case where a housing
    accommodation is sublet, the annual income of the tenant or co-tenant recited on the lease who will reoccupy the housing accommodation upon the expiration of the sublease shall be considered. 2. Deregulation income threshold means total annual income
    equal to one hundred seventy-five thousand dollars in each of the two preceding calendar years for proceedings commenced before July first, two thousand eleven. For proceedings commenced on or after July first, two thousand eleven, the deregulation
    income threshold means the total annual income equal to two hundred thousand dollars in each of the two preceding calendar years. 3. Deregulation rent threshold means two thousand dollars for proceedings commenced before July first, two thousand eleven.
    For proceedings commenced on or after July first, two thousand eleven, the deregulation rent threshold means two thousand five hundred dollars. (b) On or before the first day of May in each calendar year, the owner of each housing accommodation for
    which the legal regulated rent equals or exceeds the deregulation rent threshold may provide the tenant or tenants residing therein with an income certification form prepared by the division of housing and community renewal on which such tenant or
    tenants shall identify all persons referred to in subdivision (a) of this section and shall certify whether the total annual income is in excess of the deregulation income threshold in each of the two preceding calendar years. Such income certification
    form shall state that the income level certified to by the tenant may be subject to verification by the department of taxation and finance pursuant to section one hundred seventy-one-b of the tax law and shall not require disclosure of any income
    information other than whether the aforementioned threshold has been exceeded. Such income certification form shall clearly state that: (i) only tenants residing in housing accommodations which have a legal regulated monthly rent, that equals or exceeds
    the deregulation rent threshold are required to complete the certification form; (ii) that tenants have protections available to them which are designed to prevent harassment; (iii) that tenants are not required to provide any information regarding
    their income except that which is requested on the form and may contain such other information the division deems appropriate. The tenant or tenants shall return the completed certification to the owner within thirty days after service upon the tenant
    or tenants. In the event that the total annual income as certified is in excess of the deregulation income threshold in each of the two preceding calendar years, the owner may file the certification with the state division of housing and community
    renewal on or before June thirtieth of such year. Upon filing such certification with the division, the division shall, within thirty days after the filing, issue an order providing that such housing accommodation shall not be subject to the provisions
    of this act upon the expiration of the existing lease. A copy of such order shall be mailed by regular and certified mail, return receipt requested, to the tenant or tenants and a copy thereof shall be mailed to the owner. (c) 1. In the event that
    the tenant or tenants either fail to return the completed certification to the owner on or before the date required by subdivision (b) of this section or the owner disputes the certification returned by the tenant or tenants, the owner may, on or
    before June thirtieth of such year, petition the state division of housing and community renewal to verify, pursuant to section one hundred seventy-one-b of the tax law, whether the total annual income exceeds the deregulation income threshold in
    each of the two preceding calendar years. Within twenty days after the filing of such request with the division, the division shall notify the tenant or tenants named on the lease that such tenant or tenants must provide the division with such information
    as the division and the department of taxation and finance shall require to verify whether the total annual income exceeds the deregulation income threshold in each of the two preceding calendar years. The division&#39;s notification shall require the
    tenant or tenants to provide the information to the division within sixty days of service upon such tenant or tenants and shall include a warning in bold faced type that failure to respond will result in an order being issued by the division providing
    that such housing accommodation shall not be subject to the provisions of this law. 2. If the department of taxation and finance determines that the total annual income is in excess of the deregulation income threshold in each of the two preceding
    calendar years, the division shall, on or before November fifteenth of such year, notify the owner and tenants of the results of such verification. Both the owner and the tenants shall have thirty days within which to comment on such verification
    results. Within forty-five days after the expiration of the comment period, the division shall, where appropriate, issue an order providing that such housing accommodation shall not be subject to the provisions of this law upon the expiration of the
    existing lease. A copy of such order shall be mailed by regular and certified mail, return receipt requested, to the tenant or tenants and a copy thereof shall be sent to the owner. 3. In the event the tenant or tenants fail to provide the information
    required pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision, the division shall issue, on or before December first of such year, an order providing that such housing accommodation shall not be subject to the provisions of this law upon the expiration of
    the current lease. A copy of such order shall be mailed by regular and certified mail, return receipt requested, to the tenant or tenants and a copy thereof shall be sent to the owner. 4. The provisions of the state freedom of information act shall
    not apply to any income information obtained by the division pursuant to this section. (d) This section shall apply only to <a href='/adc/sections/26-504.1.html'>section 26-504.1</a> of this chapter. (e) Upon receipt of such order of deregulation pursuant to this section, an owner shall offer
    the housing accommodation subject to such order to the tenant at a rent not in excess of the market rent, which for the purposes of this section means a rent obtainable in an arm&#39;s length transaction. Such rental offer shall be made by the owner in
    writing to the tenant by certified and regular mail and shall inform the tenant that such offer must be accepted in writing within ten days of receipt. The tenant shall respond within ten days after receipt of such offer. If the tenant declines the
    offer or fails to respond within such period, the owner may commence an action or proceeding for the eviction of such tenant. * NB Expires April 1, 2015</span>
