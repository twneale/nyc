    settlement or injunctive relief in excess of threshold amounts or of a type established by the commission; (i) a listing of any criminal or civil investigation by a federal, state, or local prosecutorial agency, investigative agency or regulatory
    agency, in the five year period preceding the application, wherein such applicant: (A) knew or should have known that the applicant was the subject of such investigation, or (B) has received a subpoena requiring the production of documents or information
    in connection with such investigation; (j) a certification that an applicant business has paid all federal, state, and local income taxes related to the applicant&#39;s business for which the applicant is responsible for the three tax years preceding
    the date of the application or documentation that the applicant is contesting such taxes in a pending judicial or administrative proceeding; (k) a listing of any license, permit or other permission held by the applicant to engage in any capacity in

    applicant believes demonstrates the applicant&#39;s good character, honesty and integrity, including a licensing determination from another jurisdiction. Notwithstanding any provision of this subdivision, an applicant for a certificate of approval shall
    not be required to submit information described in subparagraphs (a) and (m) of this paragraph or any other information the commission determines is not necessary or appropriate. An applicant may also submit to the commission any material or explanation
    which the applicant believes demonstrates that any information submitted pursuant to this paragraph does not reflect adversely upon the applicant&#39;s good character, honesty and integrity. The commission may require that applicants pay fees to cover
    the expenses of fingerprinting and background investigations provided for in this subdivision. iii. In the case of a shipboard gambling business, the commission may also require that an applicant submit any or all of the information required by this
    paragraph with respect to any affiliate or subsidiary of the applicant that owns or operates a business in any jurisdiction. iv. Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, for purposes of this section in the case of an applicant shipboard gambling
    business that has a parent business entity: (A) fingerprinting and disclosure under this section shall be required of any person acting for or on behalf of the parent business who has direct management or supervisory responsibility for the operations
    or performance of the applicant; (B) the chief executive officer, chief operating officer and chief financial officer, or any other person exercising comparable responsibilities and functions, of any subsidiary or affiliate of such parent business
    entity over which any person subject to fingerprinting and disclosure under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph exercises similar responsibilities shall be fingerprinted and shall submit the information required pursuant to subparagraphs (f) and (g)
    of paragraph ii of this subdivision, as well as such additional information pursuant to this paragraph as the commission may find necessary; and (C) the listing specified under subparagraph (i) of paragraph ii of this subdivision shall also be provided
    for any subsidiary or affiliate of the parent business entity for which fingerprinting and disclosure by principals thereof is made pursuant to (B) of this paragraph. v. The chief executive officer, chief operating officer and chief financial officer,
    or any other person exercising comparable responsibilities and functions, of any subsidiary or affiliate of a shipboard gambling business shall be fingerprinted and shall submit the information required pursuant to subparagraphs (f), (g) and (i) of
    paragraph ii of this subdivision, as well as such other information pursuant to this paragraph that the commission may find necessary. c. A business required to be licensed pursuant to this chapter shall inform the commission, within a reasonable
    time, of any changes in the ownership composition of such business, the addition or deletion of any principal at any time subsequent to the issuance of the license, the arrest or criminal conviction of any principal of the business, or any other material
    change in the information submitted on the application for a license. A business required to be licensed shall provide the commission with notice of at least ten business days of the proposed addition of a new principal to such business. The commission
    may waive or shorten such period upon a showing that there exists a bona fide business requirement therefor. Except where the commission determines within such period, based upon information available to it, that the addition of such new principal
    may have a result inimical to the purposes of this chapter, the licensee may add such new principal pending the completion of review by the commission. The licensee shall be afforded an opportunity to demonstrate to the commission that the addition
    of such new principal pending completion of such review would not have a result inimical to the purposes of this chapter. If upon the completion of such review, the commission determines that such principal has not demonstrated that he or she possesses
    good character, honesty and integrity, the license shall cease to be valid unless such principal divests his or her interest, or discontinues his or her involvement in the business of such licensee, as the case may be, within a reasonable time period
    prescribed by the commission. d. Each applicant business shall provide the commission with a business address in New York city where notices may be delivered and legal process served and shall designate a person of suitable age and discretion at such
    address who shall be an agent for service of process.</span>
