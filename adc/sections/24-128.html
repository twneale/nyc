(a) No operating certificate shall be granted for the use or operation of equipment or apparatus for which an installation or alteration permit is required unless the applicant shows
    to the satisfaction of the commissioner that the equipment or apparatus satisfies the standards of <a href='/adc/sections/24-125.html'>section 24-125</a> of this code and is installed or altered in accordance with the requirements and conditions contained in the permit, or if installed

    a certificate is required by subdivision (b) of <a href='/adc/sections/24-122.html'>section 24-122</a> of this code unless the applicant files an application and plans as required by <a href='/adc/sections/24-124.html'>section 24-124</a> of this code for installation and alteration permits, and shows to the satisfaction of the
    commissioner that: (1) The equipment satisfied the standards required by <a href='/adc/sections/24-125.html'>section 24-125</a> of this code for the granting of a permit for similar new or altered equipment, with the exception of the requirements relating to stacks and ducts in paragraph

    with or satisfied. (e) If an owner fails to make application to renew an operating certificate within one hundred eighty days from the date of mailing of notice by the commissioner that such application is required, such owner shall be required to
