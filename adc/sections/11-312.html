    recommendation to the council of a proposed interest rate to be charged for nonpayment of water rents. In making such recommendations the commission shall consider the prevailing interest rates charged for commercial loans extended to prime borrowers
    by commercial banks operating in the city and shall propose a rate of at least six per centum per annum greater than such rates. The council may by resolution adopt an interest rate to be charged for nonpayment of water rents pursuant to <a href='/adc/sections/11-224.html'>section 11-224</a>
    of the code and, for nonpayment of water rents that become due and payable on or after July first, two thousand five, pursuant to <a href='/adc/sections/11-224.1.html'>section 11-224.1</a> of the code, and may specify in such resolution the date on which such interest rate is to take effect.
