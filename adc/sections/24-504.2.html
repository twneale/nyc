The department shall, within eight months of the effective date of this section, complete an analysis of the combined sewer outfall system and its relationship to
    floatables, including medical debris, discharged through the system, which are deposited on beaches and other shorelines throughout the city. This analysis shall include, but not be limited to, identifying, evaluating and providing: 1. The location
    of each combined sewer regulator and outfall within the city of New York; 2. A list identifying priority combined sewer regulators, specifically indicating those which discharge within five hundred feet of designated bathing areas; 3. The general
    composition and quantity of floatables, including medical debris, that are discharged from the combined sewer system, to be compiled from available data; 4. Environmental impacts of floatables, including medical debris, to be compiled from available
    data; 5. The long-term solutions to be advanced to reduce the discharge of floatables, including medical debris, from combined sewer systems onto beaches and shorelines throughout the city, and the costs associated with these efforts; 6. A quarterly
    report about the status of this debris, as evidenced by the city-wide floatables study, which shall include any short-term collection and containment methods discovered, which could be implemented in order to reduce the discharge of floatables from
    the combined sewer system onto beaches and shorelines throughout the city, and the proposed costs associated with these efforts. b. The commissioner shall, within eight months of the effective date of this section, submit to the council a report on
    the findings of such analysis and any recommendations as to regulations or legislation necessary to implement the recommendations of the analysis.</span>
