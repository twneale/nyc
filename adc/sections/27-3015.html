Any license and seal issued hereunder shall expire one year from the year of issuance on the licensee&#39;s date of birth for that year irrespective of the date of issue. Such
    license may be renewed every year thereafter without examination, provided application for such renewal, accompanied by the renewal fees prescribed above and such information as may be required by the commissioner to ensure compliance with <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/27-3016.html'>section
    27-3016</a> of this chapter and evidence of insurance coverage in compliance with <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/27-3013.html'>section 27-3013</a> of this chapter, shall have been filed prior to the expiration of the existing license. 1. Where an applicant can show good and sufficient cause for his
    or her inability to renew his or her license and seal before its expiration, the commissioner may, upon submission of a complete application for late renewal within ninety (90) days after the expiration of such license, permit the issuance, without
    examination, of a new license and seal upon payment of the prescribed fees for such new license and seal within said ninety days. The commissioner may promulgate rules authorizing the renewal of a license up to six months after the expiration of such
    license for extenuating circumstances. 2. No license shall be renewed and no new license and seal shall be issued unless all outstanding fees required by <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/27-3018.html'>section 27-3018</a> of this code have been paid. 3. Renewal shall also be subject to the licensee&#39;s
    good moral character. As provided in department rule, the licensee&#39;s failure to clear open violations in a timely manner may result in the refusal to renew a license until the violations are resolved. 4. The commissioner may promulgate rules requiring
    applicants for the renewal of master or special electrician&#39;s licenses to submit proof, in such form as he or she shall determine, that, in each year of the license term, such applicant completed at least eight hours of continuing education courses
    approved by the department. Such proof shall be submitted with the license renewal application. b. If a master electrician&#39;s or special electrician&#39;s license is suspended for cause, and the restoration thereof is conditional upon some action to be
    taken by the holder of the master electrician&#39;s or special electrician&#39;s license and the holder fails to take action before the expiration of the license, such failure shall be cause for the denial of the subsequent application to renew the license
    and seal.</span>
