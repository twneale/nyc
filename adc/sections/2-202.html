    Island, bounded by the following described line: Beginning at the northerly United States bulkhead line of the Harlem river at the junction of the Hudson and Harlem rivers; thence along the northerly and easterly United States bulkhead lines of the
    Harlem river to the low-water mark on the westerly bank of the Spuyten Duyvil creek as it existed prior to its being filled in; thence along said low-water mark of Spuyten Duyvil creek to the easterly United States bulkhead line of the Harlem river;
    thence southerly along the easterly United States bulkhead line of the Harlem river to a point where said United States bulkhead line of the Harlem river intersects the northerly United States bulkhead line of the Bronx kills; thence along the northerly
    line of the United States bulkhead line of the Bronx kills to the intersection of the northerly United States bulkhead line of the East river; thence across the East river to the low-water mark on the shore of Long Island, so as to include Randall&#39;s
    Island and Ward&#39;s Island; thence along the low-water mark on the shore of Long Island to the southerly side of Red Hook; thence across the Upper bay to the westerly boundary of the state; thence northerly along such westerly boundary of the state
    to a point where a perpendicular drawn from the point or place of beginning intersects such westerly boundary of the state; thence easterly along such perpendicular to the point or place of beginning; including all the islands or parts thereof situated
    within the aforedescribed bounds. 2. The borough of The Bronx shall consist of the territory known as Bronx county which shall contain all that part of the city and state bounded on the east by the middle of the main channel of Long Island sound;
    bounded on the south by the following described line: Beginning at a point in the middle of the channel of Long Island sound where it intersects the middle of the channel of the East river easterly of Throgg&#39;s neck; thence westerly along the middle
    of the channel of the East river to a point where such channel crosses a straight line from the Clason point in the borough and county of the Bronx to College point on Long Island; thence southwesterly to the most easterly point of the United States
    bulkhead line of Rikers Island; thence generally southerly and westerly along said United States bulkhead line of Rikers Island to the most southerly point of said United States bulkhead line; thence westerly still along said United States bulkhead
    line to the most southwesterly point of said United States bulkhead line of Rikers Island; thence northwesterly in a straight line to the junction of the northerly United States bulkhead line of the Bronx kills and the northerly United States bulkhead
    line of the East river; thence bounded on the west by the borough of Manhattan and county of New York and by the westerly boundary of the state, and bounded on the north by the following described line: Beginning at a point in the Hudson river where
    the westerly boundary of the state crosses the westerly prolongation of a straight line drawn from a point on the easterly bank of the Hudson river at latitude 40° 54&#39; 53.21&quot; north and longitude 73° 54&#39; 38.64&quot; west of Greenwich to a point in the center
    of the former bed of the Bronx river at latitude 40° 53&#39; 59.23&quot; north and longitude 73° 51&#39; 35.67&quot; west of Greenwich; thence easterly along such line to a point formed by the intersection of such line with the center line of East Two hundred fortieth
    street; thence easterly along the center line of such street, a distance of 62.23 feet; thence easterly on a line parallel to the northerly line of McLean avenue as it existed the twenty-sixth day of May, nineteen hundred seventeen, and distant 60
    feet southerly therefrom, a distance of 159.46 feet to the aforementioned straight line drawn from a point on the easterly bank of the Hudson river to a point in the center of the former bed of the Bronx river; thence easterly along such line to a
    point fomed by the intersection of such line with the center line of Webster avenue, distant 618.47 feet from a point in the former bed of the Bronx river whose coordinates are north 43554.440 and west 31924.769 based on the United States Coast and
    Geodetic system which is used in that part of the borough of The Bronx to the east of and including the Bronx river; thence northeasterly, a distance of 65.6 feet to a point in the westerly prolongation of the northerly line of East Two hundred thirty-eighth
