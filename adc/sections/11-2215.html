Except in accordance with proper judicial order or as otherwise provided by law, it shall be unlawful for the commissioner of motor vehicles, any officer or employee of the department of motor vehicles, the commissioner
    finance, any officer or employee of the department of finance, the tax appeals tribunal, any commissioner or employee of such tribunal, any agent of the commissioner of motor vehicles, or any person who, pursuant to this section, is permitted to inspect
    any return or to whom a copy, an abstract or portion of any return is furnished, or to whom any information contained in any return is furnished to divulge or make known in any manner any information contained in or relating to any return provided
    for by this chapter. The officers charged with the custody of such returns shall not be required to produce any of them or evidence of anything contained in them in any action or proceeding in any court, except on behalf of the commissioner of motor
    vehicles or the commissioner of finance in an action or proceeding under the provisions of this chapter, or on behalf of any party to an action or proceeding under the provisions of this chapter when the returns or facts shown thereby are directly
    involved in such action or proceeding, in either of which events the court may require the production of, and may admit in evidence, so much of said returns or of the facts shown thereby, as are pertinent to the action or proceeding and no more. The
    commissioner of motor vehicles may, nevertheless, publish a copy or a summary of any determination or decision rendered after a formal hearing held pursuant to <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-2206.html'>section 11-2206</a> or 11-2208 of this chapter. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit
    the delivery to a person or his or her duly authorized representative of a certified copy of any return filed by him or her pursuant to this chapter, or of the receipt, document or other form issued pursuant to <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-2204.html'>section 11-2204</a> of this chapter, or
    a duplicate copy thereof; nor to prohibit the delivery of such a certified copy of such return or of any information contained in or relating thereto, to the United States of America or any department thereof, the state of New York or any department
    thereof, the city of New York or any department thereof provided the same is required for official business; nor to prohibit the inspection for official business of such returns by the corporation counsel or other legal representatives of the city
    or by the district attorney of any county within the city; nor to prohibit the publication of statistics so classified as to prevent the identification of particular returns or items thereof. b. (1) Any officer or employee of the state of New York
    or the city who willfully violates the provisions of subdivision a of this section shall be dismissed from office and be incapable of holding any public office in the state of New York or this city for a period of five years thereafter. (2) Cross-reference:
    For criminal penalties, see chapter forty of this title. c. This section shall be deemed a state statute for purposes of paragraph (a) of subdivision two of section eighty-seven of the public officers law. d. Notwithstanding anything in subdivision
    a of this section to the contrary, if a taxpayer has petitioned the tax appeals tribunal for administrative review as provided in section one hundred seventy of the charter, the commissioner of finance shall be authorized to present to the tax appeals
    tribunal any report or return of such taxpayer, or any information contained therein or relating thereto, which may be material or relevant to the proceeding before the tax appeals tribunal. The tax appeals tribunal shall be authorized to publish
    a copy or a summary of any decision rendered pursuant to section one hundred seventy-one of the charter.
