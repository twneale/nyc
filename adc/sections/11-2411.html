                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/adc/sections/11-2411.html'>§ 11-2411</a> Proceedings to recover tax. a. Whenever any person shall fail to pay any tax or penalty or interest imposed by this chapter as herein provided, the corporation counsel shall, upon the request of the commissioner, bring or cause to be brought
    an action to enforce payment of the same against the person liable for the same on behalf of the city of New York in any court of the state of New York or of any other state or of the United States. If, however, the commissioner in his or her discretion
    believes that a taxpayer subject to the provisions of this chapter is about to cease business, leave the state or remove or dissipate the assets out of which tax or penalties or interest might be satisfied and that any such tax or penalty or interest
    will not be paid when due, he or she may declare such tax or penalty or interest to be immediately due and payable and may issue a warrant immediately. b. As an additional or alternate remedy, the commission may issue a warrant, directed to the city
    sheriff, commanding such sheriff to levy upon and sell the real and personal property of such person which may be found within the city, for the payment of the amount thereof, with any penalties and interest, and the cost of executing the warrant,
    and to return such warrant to the commissioner and to pay to him or her the money collected by virtue thereof within sixty days after receipt of such warrant. The city sheriff shall, within five days after the receipt of the warrant, file with the
    county clerk a copy thereof, and thereupon such clerk shall enter in the judgment docket the name of the person mentioned in the warrant and the amount of the tax, penalties and interest for which the warrant is issued and the date when such copy
    is filed. Thereupon the amount of such warrant so docketed shall become a lien upon the title to and interest in real and personal property of the person against whom the warrant is issued. The city sheriff shall then proceed upon the warrant in the
    same manner and with like effect as that provided by law in respect to executions issued against property upon judgments of a court of record, and for services in executing the warrant such sheriff shall be entitled to the same fees which he or she
    may collect in the same manner. In the discretion of the commissioner a warrant of like terms, force and effect may be issued and directed to any officer or employee of the department of finance, and in the execution thereof such officer or employee
    shall have all the powers conferred by law upon sheriffs, but he or she shall be entitled to no fee for compensation in excess of the actual expenses paid in the performance of such duty. If a warrant is returned not satisfied in full, the commissioner
    may from time to time issue new warrants and shall also have the same remedies to enforce the amount due thereunder as if the city had recovered judgment therefor and execution thereon had been returned unsatisfied. c. Whenever there is made a sale,
    transfer or assignment in bulk of any part or the whole of a stock of merchandise or of fixtures, or merchandise and of fixtures pertaining to the conducting of the business of the seller, transferor or assignor, otherwise than in the ordinary course
    of trade and in the regular prosecution of said business, the purchaser, transferee or assignee shall at least ten days before taking possession of such merchandise, fixtures, or merchandise and fixtures, or paying therefor, notify the commissioner
    by registered mail of the proposed sale and of the price, terms and conditions thereof whether or not the seller, transferor or assignor, has represented to, or informed the purchaser, transferee or assignee that it owes any tax pursuant to this chapter
    and whether or not the purchaser, transferee or assignee has knowledge that such taxes are owing, and whether any such taxes are in fact owing. Whenever the purchaser, transferee or assignee shall fail to give notice to the commissioner as required
    by the preceding paragraph, or whenever the commissioner shall inform the purchaser, transferee or assignee that a possible claim for such tax or taxes exists, any sums of money, property or choses in action, or other consideration, which the purchaser,
    transferee or assignee is required to transfer over to the seller, transferor or assignor shall be subject to a first priority right and lien for any such taxes theretofore or thereafter determined to be due from the seller, transferor or assignor
    to the city, and the purchaser, transferee or assignee is forbidden to transfer to the seller, transferor or assignor any such sums of money, property or choses in action to the extent of the amount of the city&#39;s claim. For failure to comply with
    the provisions of this subdivision, the purchaser, transferee or assignee, in addition to being subject to the liabilities and remedies imposed under the provisions of article six of the uniform commercial code, shall be personally liable for the
    payment to the city of any such taxes theretofore or thereafter determined to be due to the city from the seller, transferor or assignor, and such liability may be assessed and enforced in the same manner as the liability for tax under this chapter.
    d. The commissioner of finance, if he or she finds that the interests of the city will not thereby be jeopardized, and upon such conditions as the commissioner of finance may require, may release any property from the lien of any warrant or vacate
    such warrant for unpaid taxes, additions to tax, penalties and interest filed pursuant to subdivision b of this section, and such release or vacating of the warrant may be recorded in the office of any recording officer in which such warrant has been
    filed. The clerk shall thereupon cancel and discharge as of the original date of docketing the vacated warrant.</span>
