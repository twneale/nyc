                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-2108.html'>§ 11-2108</a> Refunds. a. In the manner provided in this section the commissioner of finance shall refund or credit, without interest, any tax, penalty or interest erroneously, illegally or unconstitutionally collected or paid if application to the commissioner
    of finance for such refund shall be made within one year from the payment thereof. Whenever a refund is made or denied by the commissioner of finance, the commissioner shall state his or her reason therefor and give notice thereof to the taxpayer
    in writing. Such application may be made by the grantor, grantee or other person who has actually paid the tax. The commissioner of finance may, in lieu of any refund required to be made, allow credit therefor on payments due from the applicant. b.
    Any determination of the commissioner of finance denying a refund or credit pursuant to subdivision a of this section shall be final and irrevocable unless the applicant for such refund or credit, within ninety days from the mailing of notice of such
    determination, or, if the commissioner of finance has established a conciliation procedure pursuant to <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-124.html'>section 11-124</a> and the applicant has requested a conciliation conference in accordance therewith, within ninety days from the mailing of a conciliation
    decision or the date of the commissioner&#39;s confirmation of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding, both (1) serves a petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2) files a petition with the tax appeals tribunal for a hearing. Such petition
    for a refund or credit made as herein provided shall be deemed an application for a revision of any tax, penalty or interest complained of. Such hearing and any appeal to the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc from the decision rendered in such
    hearing shall be conducted in the manner and subject to the requirements prescribed by the tax appeals tribunal pursuant to sections one hundred sixty-eight through one hundred seventy-two of the charter. After such hearing, the tax appeals tribunal
    shall give notice of its decision to the applicant and the commissioner of finance. The applicant shall be entitled to review such decision of the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc by a proceeding pursuant to article seventy-eight of the civil
    practice law and rules, provided such proceeding is instituted within four months after the giving of notice of such decision, and provided, in the case of an application by a taxpayer, that a final determination of tax due was not previously made.
    Such a proceeding shall not be instituted by a taxpayer unless an undertaking is filed with the commissioner of finance in such amount and with such sureties as a justice of the supreme court shall approve to the effect that if such proceeding be
    dismissed or the tax confirmed, the taxpayer will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding. c. A person shall not be entitled to a revision, refund or credit under this section of a tax, interest or penalty
    which had been determined to be due pursuant to the provisions of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-2107.html'>section 11-2107</a> of this chapter where he or she has had a hearing or an opportunity for a hearing, as provided in said section, or has failed to avail himself or herself of the remedies
    therein provided. No refund or credit shall be made of a tax, interest or penalty paid after a determination by the commissioner of finance made pursuant to <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-2107.html'>section 11-2107</a> of this chapter unless it be found that such determination was erroneous,
    illegal or unconstitutional or otherwise improper, by the tax appeals tribunal after a hearing, or on the commissioner of finance&#39;s own motion, or, if such tax appeals tribunal affirms in whole or in part the determination of the commissioner of finance,
    in a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules, pursuant to the provisions of said section, in which event refund or credit without interest shall be made of the tax, interest or penalty found to have been overpaid.</span>
