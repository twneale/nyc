                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/nyc/adc/sections/3-706.html'>§ 3-706</a> Expenditures limitations; additional financing and limits. 1. The following limitations apply to all expenditures made by a candidate and his or her principal committee on or after the first day of January preceding the election for which such
    candidate chooses to participate in the public funding provisions of this chapter and to expenditures made at any time prior to such date for services, materials, facilities, advertising or other things of value received, rendered, published, distributed
    or broadcast on or after such date: (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subdivision, in each primary election, in each special election to fill a vacancy, and in each general election, expenditures by a participating candidate or a limited
    participating candidate and his or her principal committee for one of the following offices shall not exceed the following amounts: mayor: $6,158,000 public advocate or comptroller: $3,850,000 borough president: $1,386,000 member of the city council:
    $161,000 (b) (i) The expenditure limitation in a run-off primary election held pursuant to section 6-162 of the New York state election law or a run-off special election held to fill a vacancy shall be one half the amount of the applicable limitation
    provided for an election for such office pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (a) of this subdivision. (ii) The board shall promulgate rules to provide for a separate expenditure limit applicable to campaign expenditures for an additional day for
    voting held pursuant to <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/3-108.html'>section 3-108</a> of the New York state election law, an election held pursuant to court order, or a delayed or otherwise postponed election. (c) Expenditures by participating or limited participating candidates in a primary election
    made prior to or on the date of such primary election shall be deemed to have been made for such primary election. (d) The campaign finance board shall, pursuant to <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/3-713.html'>section 3-713</a>, submit a report to the mayor and the council on or before September
    first, nineteen hundred ninety, containing its recommendations whether the expenditure limitations provided by this subdivision should be modified. Such report shall set forth the amount of, and reasons for, any modifications it recommends. (e) Not
    later than the first day of March in the year two thousand ten and every fourth year thereafter the campaign finance board shall (i) determine the percentage difference between the average over a calendar year of the consumer price index for the metropolitan
    New York-New Jersey region published by the United States bureau of labor statistics for the twelve months preceding the beginning of such calendar year and the average over the calendar year two thousand seven of such consumer price index; (ii) adjust
    each expenditure limitation applicable either pursuant to this subdivision or subdivision 2 of this section by the amount of such percentage difference to the nearest thousand dollars and (iii) publish such adjusted expenditure limitation in the City
    Record. Such adjusted expenditure limitation shall be in effect for any election held before the next such adjustment. 2. The following limitations apply to all expenditures made by a participating or limited participating candidate and his or her
    principal committee in the three calendar years preceding the year of the election for which such candidate chooses to file a certification as a participating or limited participating candidate pursuant to this chapter and to expenditures made at
    any time prior to such date for services, materials, facilities, advertising or other things of value received, rendered, published, distributed or broadcast in such calendar years. Such expenditures by a participating or limited participating candidate
    for one of the following offices and his or her principal committee shall not exceed the following amounts: mayor, public advocate or comptroller: $290,000 borough president: $129,000 member of the city council: $43,000 2-a. (a) If the expenditures
    made by a candidate and his or her principal committee subject to the expenditure limitation of subdivision two of this section exceed the amount of the expenditure limitation applicable under such subdivision, such candidate or his or her principal
    committee shall not be ineligible to receive public funding for qualified campaign expenditures or be in violation of this chapter by reason of exceeding such limitation unless the amount by which such expenditures exceed such limitation is in excess
    of the expenditure limitation which next applies to such candidate or his or her principal committee pursuant to subdivision one of this section; and further provided that the amount of the expenditure limitation which next applies to such candidate
    or his or her principal committee, pursuant to subdivision one of this section, shall be reduced by the amount by which the expenditure limitation applicable under subdivision two of this section is exceeded. (b) Nothing contained in paragraph (a)
    of this subdivision shall: (i) operate to increase or decrease the amount of public funds that may be received pursuant to <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/3-705.html'>section 3-705</a> by the principal committee; (ii) affect the expenditure limitation set forth in paragraph (b) of subdivision one
    of this section; or (iii) affect the expenditure limitation set forth in paragraph (a) of subdivision one of this section for purposes of the application of subdivision three of this section. 3. (a) If any candidate in any covered election chooses
    not to file a certification as a participating or limited participating candidate pursuant to this chapter, and where the campaign finance board has determined that such candidate and his or her authorized committees have spent or contracted or have
    obligated to spend, or received in loans or contributions, or both, an amount which, in the aggregate, exceeds half the applicable expenditure limit for such office fixed by subdivision one of this section, then: (i) such expenditure limit applicable
    to participating candidates and limited participating candidates in such election for such office shall be increased to one hundred fifty percent of such limit; and (ii) the principal committees of such participating candidates shall receive payment
    for qualified campaign expenditures of five dollars for each one dollar of matchable contributions, up to one thousand two hundred fifty dollars in public funds per contributor (or up to six hundred twenty five dollars in public funds per contributor
    in the case of a special election); provided, however, that (A) participating candidates in a run-off election shall receive public funds for such election pursuant to subdivision five of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/3-705.html'>section 3-705</a> and shall not receive any additional public funds
    pursuant to this section, and (B) in no case shall a principal committee receive in public funds an amount exceeding two-thirds of the expenditure limitation provided for such office in subdivision one of this section. (iii) for elections occurring
    after January first, two thousand eight, the campaign finance board shall promulgate rules to provide that the principal committees of such participating candidates shall receive payment for qualified campaign expenditures that will provide the highest
    allowable matchable contribution to be matched by an amount up to one thousand two hundred fifty dollars in public funds per contributor (or up to six hundred twenty five dollars in public funds per contributor in the case of special election); provided,
    however, that (A) participating candidates in a run-off election shall receive public funds for such election pursuant to subdivision five of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/3-705.html'>section 3-705</a> and shall not receive any additional public funds pursuant to this section, and (B) in no case
    shall a principal committee receive in public funds an amount exceeding two-thirds of the expenditure limitation provided for such office in subdivision one of this section. (b) If any candidate in any covered election chooses not to file a certification
    as a participating or limited participating candidate pursuant to this chapter, and where the campaign finance board has determined that such candidate and his or her authorized committees have spent or contracted or have obligated to spend, or received
    in loans or contributions, or both, an amount which, in the aggregate, exceeds three times the applicable expenditure limit for such office fixed by subdivision one of this section, then: (i) such expenditure limit shall no longer apply to participating
    candidates and limited participating candidates in such election for such office; and (ii) the principal committees of such participating candidates shall receive payment for qualified campaign expenditures of six dollars for each one dollar of matchable
    contributions, up to one thousand five hundred dollars in public funds per contributor (or up to seven hundred fifty dollars in public funds per contributor in the case of a special election); provided, however, that (A) participating candidates in
    a run-off election shall receive public funds for such election pursuant to subdivision five of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/3-705.html'>section 3-705</a> and shall not receive any additional public funds pursuant to this section, and (B) in no case shall a principal committee receive in public
    funds an amount exceeding one hundred twenty-five percent of the expenditure limitation provided for such office in subdivision one of this section. (iii) for elections occurring after January first, two thousand eight, the campaign finance board
    shall promulgate rules to provide that the principal committees of such participating candidates shall receive payment for qualified campaign expenditures that will provide the highest allowable matchable contribution to be matched by an amount up
    to one thousand five hundred dollars in public funds per contributor (or up to seven hundred fifty dollars in public funds per contributor in the case of special election); provided, however, that (A) participating candidates in a run-off election
    shall receive public funds for such election pursuant to subdivision five of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/3-705.html'>section 3-705</a> and shall not receive any additional public funds pursuant to this section, and (B) in no case shall a principal committee receive in public funds an amount
    exceeding one hundred twenty-five percent of the expenditure limitation provided for such office in subdivision one of this section. 4. (a) Expenditures made for the purpose of: (i) bringing or responding to any action, proceeding, claim or suit before
    any court or arbitrator or administrative agency to determine a candidate&#39;s or political committee&#39;s compliance with the requirements of this chapter, including eligibility for public funds payments, or pursuant to or with respect to election law
    or other law or regulation governing candidate or political committee activity or ballot status, (ii) expenses to challenge or defend the validity of petitions of designation or nomination or certificates of nomination, acceptance, authorization,
    declination or substitution, and expenses related to the canvassing or re-canvassing of election results, and (iii) expenses related to the post-election audit shall not be limited by the expenditure limitations of this section. (b) A participating
    candidate shall be required to provide detailed documentation substantiating all exempt expenditure claims made pursuant to this subdivision.</span>
