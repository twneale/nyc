                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/adc/sections/17-508.html'>§ 17-508</a> Violations and penalties. a. It shall be unlawful for any person who owns, manages, operates or otherwise controls the use of premises in which smoking is prohibited or restricted pursuant to this chapter, or the designated agent thereof, to
    (i) provide a room designated for smoking including, but not limited to, a separate smoking room or an enclosed room, which fails to comply with the provisions of this chapter; provided, however, that the obligations of an owner or building manager
    of a building (where such owner or building manager of a building in which a public place is located is not the operator or employer of such public place) with respect to such a room shall be limited to work authorized by any permits necessary to
    perform construction obtained by the owner or his or her agent; (ii) fail to post the signs required by <a href='/adc/sections/17-506.html'>section 17-506</a>; (iii) fail to remove ashtrays as required by subdivision d of <a href='/adc/sections/17-506.html'>section 17-506</a>; or (iv) fail to make a good faith effort to comply
    with subdivisions c, d and e of <a href='/adc/sections/17-507.html'>section 17-507</a>. In actions brought for violations of this subdivision, the following shall be affirmative defenses: (i) that during the relevant time period actual control of the premises was not exercised by the respondent
    or a person under the control of the respondent, but rather by a lessee, sublessee or any other person; provided, however, that after receiving the notice of violation, the respondent submits to the department within five business days, by certified
    mail, a sworn affidavit and other such proof as may be necessary, indicating that he or she has not exercised actual control during the relevant time period; (ii) that a person smoking in any area where smoking is prohibited pursuant to <a href='/adc/sections/17-503.html'>section 17-503</a>
    was informed by a person who owns, manages, operates or otherwise controls the use of such premises, or the designated agent thereof, that such person smoking is in violation of this local law and that such person who owns, manages, operates or otherwise
    controls the use of such premises has complied with all applicable provisions of this chapter during the relevant time period; provided, however, that after receiving notice of violation, the respondent submits to the department within five business
    days, by certified mail, a sworn affidavit and other such proof as may be necessary, indicating that respondent informed the person smoking in any area where smoking is prohibited pursuant to <a href='/adc/sections/17-503.html'>section 17-503</a> that such person was in violation of this
    local law and that respondent has complied with all applicable provisions of this chapter during the relevant time period; or (iii) that a person smoking in any restricted common indoor area where smoking is prohibited pursuant to <a href='/adc/sections/17-503.html'>section 17-503</a> was
    not informed by the owner or building manager of the premises (where such owner or building manager of a building in which a public place or a place of employment is located is not the operator or employer of such public place or place of employment)
    or by the operator of a multiple dwelling containing ten or more dwelling units that such person smoking is in violation of this local law because such owner, building manager or operator did not have a designated agent on duty when such person was
    smoking and that such owner or building manager has, where applicable, complied with the mailing of a notice required pursuant to subdivision e of <a href='/adc/sections/17-507.html'>section 17-507</a>; provided, however, that after receiving notice of violation, the respondent submits
    to the department within five business days, by certified mail, a sworn affidavit and other such proof as may be necessary, indicating that a person smoking in any restricted common indoor area where smoking is prohibited pursuant to <a href='/adc/sections/17-503.html'>section 17-503</a>
    was not informed by the respondent that such person smoking is in violation of this local law because the respondent did not have a designated agent on duty when such person was smoking and that the respondent has, where applicable, mailed the notice
    required pursuant to subdivision e of <a href='/adc/sections/17-507.html'>section 17-507</a>. b. It shall be unlawful for an employer whose place of employment is subject to regulation under <a href='/adc/sections/17-504.html'>section 17-504</a> to fail to comply with the provisions of that section, including, but not limited
    to, those provisions requiring the adoption, implementation, dissemination and maintenance of a written smoking policy which conforms to the requirements of subdivision e of <a href='/adc/sections/17-504.html'>section 17-504</a>, or to fail to make a good faith effort to comply with subdivision
    c of <a href='/adc/sections/17-507.html'>section 17-507</a>. In actions brought for violations of this subdivision, it shall be an affirmative defense that the employer (i) has made good faith efforts to insure that employees comply with the provisions of such written smoking policy and
    (ii) has complied with all applicable provisions of this chapter. d. It shall be unlawful for any person to smoke in any area where smoking is prohibited under <a href='/adc/sections/17-503.html'>section 17-503</a> and <a href='/adc/sections/17-504.html'>section 17-504</a>. e. Every person who violates subdivisions a or b of
    this section shall, for a first violation thereof, be liable for a civil penalty of not less than two hundred dollars nor more than four hundred dollars; for a second violation, both of which were committed within a period of twelve months, be liable
    for a civil penalty of not less than five hundred dollars nor more than one thousand dollars; and for a third or subsequent violation, all of which were committed within a period of twelve months, be liable for a civil penalty of not less than one
    thousand dollars nor more than two thousand dollars. Every person who violates subdivision d of this section shall be liable for a civil penalty of one hundred dollars for each violation, except that every person who violates subdivision d of this
    section by smoking in a pedestrian plaza as prohibited by paragraph seven of subdivision c of <a href='/adc/sections/17-503.html'>section 17-503</a> or in a park or other property under the jurisdiction of the department of parks and recreation as prohibited by paragraph three of subdivision
    d of <a href='/adc/sections/17-503.html'>section 17-503</a> shall be liable for a civil penalty of fifty dollars for each violation. f. A proceeding to recover any civil penalty authorized pursuant to the provisions of subdivision e of this section shall be commenced by the service of a
    notice of violation which shall be returnable to the administrative tribunal established by the board of health, except that a proceeding to recover a civil penalty authorized pursuant to subdivision e for violation of subdivision d by smoking in
    a pedestrian plaza or in a park or other property under the jurisdiction of the department of parks and recreation, as prohibited by paragraph seven of subdivision c and by paragraph three of subdivision d of <a href='/adc/sections/17-503.html'>section 17-503</a> respectively, shall be
    commenced by the service of a notice of violation which shall be returnable to the environmental control board. The board of health&#39;s administrative tribunal and the environmental control board shall have the power to impose the civil penalties prescribed
    by subdivision e of this section. g. Whenever a notice of violation of subdivision a or b of this section is served by a person with power to enforce the provisions of this chapter pursuant to subdivision a of <a href='/adc/sections/17-507.html'>section 17-507</a>, such notice shall, where
    applicable, include an order which requires the respondent to correct the condition constituting the violation and to file a certification with the department that the condition has been corrected. Such order shall require that the condition be corrected
    within ten days from the date that the order is issued and that certification of the correction of the condition be filed with the department in a manner and form and within such further period of time to be determined in accordance with rules and
    regulations promulgated by the commissioner. h. If the administrative tribunal established by the board of health or the environmental control board finds, upon good cause shown, that the respondent cannot correct the violation specified in subdivision
    g of this section, it may postpone the period for compliance with such order upon such terms and conditions and for such period of time as shall be appropriate under the circumstances. i. In any proceeding before the administrative tribunal established
    by the board of health or the environmental control board, if the tribunal finds that the department or other agency issuing the notice of violation has failed to prove the violation charged, it shall notify the department or other agency issuing
    the notice of violation, and the order requiring the respondent to correct the condition constituting the violation shall be deemed to be revoked. j. When the owner or operator of a bar has been found to be in violation of subparagraph c of paragraph
    twenty of subdivision a of <a href='/adc/sections/17-503.html'>section 17-503</a> on two or more occasions on the basis of one or more employees being in a separate smoking room at times not permitted under this chapter, the tribunal shall revoke the right of such owner or operator to maintain
    a separate smoking room in such bar. k. The penalties provided by this section shall be in addition to any other penalty imposed by any other provision of law or regulation thereunder.
