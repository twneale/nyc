Notwithstanding the provisions of any law, rule or regulation or the terms or conditions of any license relating to
    the examination of applicants for such licenses or the payment of fees therefor, the head of each agency of the city authorized to issue licenses or permits shall extend or renew any license issued by such agency to any person who shall: 1. Engage
    in the performance of active duty in the army, navy or marine corps of the United States, 2. Be honorably discharged therefrom or be relieved from active duty therein without fault or delinquency, and 3. Hold such license at the time of entrance upon
    such performance of active duty. b. Upon application of any such person to the appropriate agency, within one year from his or her discharge from active duty, and without further examination as to the qualification of the applicant, the head of such
    agency shall renew such license. c. Where the license is one for which there is an annual fee and where the business or occupation has been discontinued while the licensee was in active service, the head of such agency shall credit against the fee
    for the renewed license a sum equal to one-twelfth of the annual fee paid by the applicant for the license held by him or her for each month of such active duty until the expiration of such license. Application for such renewal of license shall be
    made within sixty days after the applicant&#39;s discharge from active duty. If at the time of renewal the credit, computed as above provided, is greater than the fee charged for the renewed license, the remainder of such credit shall be applied to the
    fee charged for the next subsequent renewal of such license. d. Nothing in this section shall affect any law, rule or regulation of any agency relating to the premises where the business or occupation is to be conducted or to the location or sanitary
    condition thereof. e. The term &quot;license&quot; as used in this section shall include permits. f. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section and <a href='//sections/19-505.html'>section 19-505</a> of the code, the following persons shall be entitled to receive taxicab licenses upon the
    following terms and conditions: 1. Any person who held a taxicab license and transferred same immediately preceding entry into the performance of active duty in the army, navy or marine corps of the United States, in anticipation of engaging in the
    performance of such active duty, and was subsequently honorably discharged therefrom. 2. Any person who held a taxicab license at the time of entry into the performance of active duty in the army, navy or marine corps of the United States and transferred
    such taxicab license while engaged in such duty and was or is subsequently honorably discharged. 3. Applications for taxicab licenses under this subdivision must be made to the taxicab and limosine commission within one hundred and twenty days after
    his or her discharge from military service. 4. Taxicab licenses issued pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision shall not be transferable except that licenses issued to World War II veterans (if current and operative April fifteenth, nineteen
    hundred sixty-three), shall be transferable provided said licenses have not been previously revoked for cause or surrendered voluntarily. In the event that the holder of such a license has died prior to March twenty-seventh, nineteen hundred sixty-seven,
    a transferable license shall be issued to the legal representative of the deceased licensee, provided said representative files a suitable application therefor and is qualified to hold such license.</span>
