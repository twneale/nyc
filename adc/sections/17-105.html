                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/adc/sections/17-105.html'>§ 17-105</a> Commercial paper during epidemic; duties of city clerk. a. Whenever the board of health, by public notice, shall designate any portion or district of the city as being the seat of any infectious or contagious disease, and declare communication
    with such portion or district to be dangerous, or shall prohibit such communication, the city clerk, during the continuance of such disease in such district, shall provide and keep in his or her office a book for the purpose of registering in alphabetical
    order, the names, firms and places of business of any inhabitant of the city who shall request such registry to be made. b. All persons and firms usually resident or doing business within such infected district shall register, in the books so provided,
    their names or firms, with the place or places out of such infected district, but within the city to which they may have removed the transaction of their business, or to which they may desire any notices to be sent or served, or any notes, drafts,
    or bills to be presented for acceptance or for payment. Twenty-five cents may be claimed and received by the city clerk for every such registry; but the book in which the same shall be entered shall be open to public examination free of all charges
    at all times during office hours. c. During the continuance of any such disease in such infected district, all drafts, notes and bills, which by law are required to be presented for acceptance or for payment, may be presented for such purpose at the
    place so designated in such registry, and all notices of non-acceptance and non-payment of any note, draft or bill, or of protest for such non-acceptance or non-payment, may be served by leaving the same at the place so designated. d. In case any
    person or firm usually resident or doing business within such infected district shall neglect to make and cause to be entered in the book so provided, the registry herein required, all notes, drafts or bills which by law are required to be presented
    to such person or firm for acceptance or for payment, may be presented to the city clerk during the continuance of such disease, at any time during office hours, and demand of acceptance or payment thereof may be made of such city clerk, to the same
    purpose and with the same effect as if the same had been presented and acceptance or payment demanded of such person or firm at their usual place of doing business. e. In case of omission to make the registry herein required, all notices of the non-acceptance
    or non-payment of any note, draft, or bill, or of protest for such non-acceptance or non-payment, may be served on any person or firm usually resident or doing business within such infected district, by leaving the same at one of the post-offices
    in the city. Such service shall be as valid and effectual as if the notices had been served personally on such person or one of such firm at his, her or their usual place of doing business. f. Whenever proclamation shall be made by the board of health,
    that an infectious or contagious disease in any infected district has subsided, it shall be deemed to have subsided for all purposes contemplated in this section.</span>
