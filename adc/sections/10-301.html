    each single pull of the trigger. The provisions of this chapter relating to shotguns shall not apply to assault weapons except as specifically provided. 4. &quot;Gunsmith.&quot; Any person, firm, partnership, corporation, or company who engages in the business

    company, partnership, corporation, association, cooperative, nonprofit organization or other entity engaged or seeking to engage in the activities regulated pursuant to <a href='//sections/10-302.html'>section 10-302</a> of this chapter. 15. &quot;Semiautomatic.&quot; Any firearm, rifle or shotgun
    that uses part of the energy of a fired cartridge to expel the case of the fired cartridge and load another cartridge into the firing chamber, and which requires a separate pull of the trigger to fire each cartridge. 16. &quot;Assault weapon.&quot; (a) Any
