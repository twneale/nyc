Except as provided in the vehicle and traffic law, no person shall engage in or participate in any race, exhibition or contest of speed, or aid or abet in such race, exhibition or contest of speed, on any highway,
    street, alley, sidewalk, or any public or private parking lot or area. Under this subdivision, &quot;engage in&quot; and &quot;participate&quot; shall mean actions or circumstances that reasonably indicate that a race, exhibition or contest of speed has occurred or is

    or gathering held for the purpose of a race, exhibition or contest of speed not authorized pursuant to the vehicle and traffic law. Under this subdivision, &quot;participate&quot; shall mean acts at the scene of a race, exhibition or contest of speed that reasonably
    appear to support such race, such as wagering on the outcome of the race or actively encouraging the participants to the race, exhibition or contest of speed. c. A violation of subdivision a shall constitute a misdemeanor and be punishable by imprisonment
    of not more than six months or a fine of not more than six hundred dollars, or both such fine and imprisonment. A second violation of subdivision a of this section committed within ten years of a violation of subdivision a of this section shall be
