    plumbers selected to assist the commissioner shall be publicly drawn for each examination from a panel of not less than thirty names furnished to the commissioner by a special committee to consist of one experienced master plumber representing each
    of the established and recognized master plumbers&#39; associations, or branches thereof, in the five boroughs of the city, and one experienced journeyman plumber representing the established and recognized organization having jurisdiction over journeyman
