                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/adc/sections/16-510.html'>§ 16-510</a> Investigation of employees. a. (i) Each person who is not otherwise a principal as defined in <a href='/adc/sections/16-501.html'>section 16-501</a> of this chapter and who is employed or proposed to be employed by a licensee in a managerial capacity, or in a job category specified
    in rules promulgated by the commission pursuant to <a href='/adc/sections/16-504.html'>section 16-504</a> of the chapter, and each person who acts or is proposed to act in such a capacity or in such a category as an agent of a licensee, shall: (i) be fingerprinted by a person designated
    for such purpose by the commission and pay a fee to be submitted by the commission to the division of criminal justice services for the purposes of obtaining criminal history records, and (ii) submit to the commission the information set forth in
    subparagraphs (b) through (n) of paragraph (ii) of subdivision b of <a href='/adc/sections/16-508.html'>section 16-508</a> of this chapter and pay the fee for the investigation of such information set forth in the rules promulgated pursuant to <a href='/adc/sections/16-504.html'>section 16-504</a> of this chapter. Where, at any
    time subsequent to an investigation of an employee subject to the provisions of this subdivision, the commission has reasonable cause to believe that such employee lacks good character, honesty and integrity, the commission may conduct an additional
    investigation of such employee and may require, if necessary, that such employee provide information updating, supplementing or explaining information previously submitted. The job categories specified in rules of the commission for purposes of such
    fingerprinting and disclosure shall not include personnel engaged solely in operating vehicles or handling waste or clerical personnel who have no contact with customers. (ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a licensee shall provide
    the commission with notice of at least ten business days of the proposed addition to the business of the licensee of any person subject to the provisions of this subdivision. The commission may waive or shorten such ten day period upon a showing that
    there exists a bona fide business requirement therefor. Except where the commission determines within such period, based on information available to it, that the addition of such new person may have a result inimical to the purposes of this chapter,
    the licensee may add such person pending the completion of an investigation by the commission. The licensee shall be afforded an opportunity to demonstrate to the commission that the addition of such new person pending completion of the investigation
    would not have a result inimical to the purposes of this chapter. If upon the completion of such investigation, the commission makes a final determination that such person lacks good character, honesty and integrity, the license shall cease to be
    valid unless the employment of such person in the business of such licensee is discontinued within the time period prescribed by the commission. b. (i) Where the commission has reasonable cause to believe that an employee or agent or prospective employee
    or agent of a licensee or an applicant for a license not subject to the provisions of subdivision a of this section lacks good character, honesty and integrity, the commission shall notify such employee or agent or prospective employee or agent that
    he or she shall be required to be fingerprinted and submit the information required by subdivision a of this section. c. Where, following a background investigation conducted pursuant to this section, the official designated by the commission to review
    the findings of such investigation concludes that an employee or agent or prospective employee or agent of a licensee lacks good character, honesty and integrity, such person shall be provided with notice of such conclusion and the reasons therefor
    and may contest the conclusion in person or in writing to such official. Such official shall review such response and, in the event that he or she continues to find that such person lacks good character, honesty and integrity, shall submit such final
    conclusion to the commission. The commission shall provide such person with notice of the conclusion of the official and an opportunity to be heard to appeal such conclusion before the commission makes a final determination. d. A licensee shall not
    employ or engage as an agent any person with respect to whom the commission has made a final determination, following a background investigation conducted pursuant to this section, that such person lacks good character, honesty and integrity.</span>
