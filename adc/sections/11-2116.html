                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-2116.html'>§ 11-2116</a> Notices and limitations of time. a. Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this chapter may be given by mailing the same to the person for whom it is intended in a postpaid envelope addressed to such person at the address
    given in the last return filed by him or her pursuant to the provisions of this chapter in any application made by him or her, or in any deed or instrument which is the subject of the notice, or, if no return has been filed or application made or
    address stated in the deed or instrument, then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of such notice shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the person to whom addressed. Any period of time which is determined according
    to the provisions of this chapter by the giving of notice shall commence to run from the date of mailing of such notice. b. The provisions of the civil practice law and rules or any other law relative to limitations of time for the enforcement of
    a civil remedy shall not apply to any proceeding or action taken by the city to levy, appraise, assess, determine or enforce the collection of any tax or penalty provided by this chapter. However, except in the case of a wilfully false or fraudulent
    return with intent to evade the tax, no assessment of additional tax shall be made after the expiration of more than three years from the date of the filing of a return; provided, however, that where no return has been filed as provided by law the
    tax may be assessed at any time. c. Where, before the expiration of the period prescribed herein for the assessment of an additional tax, a taxpayer has consented in writing that such period be extended, the amount of such additional tax due may be
    determined at any time within such extended period. The period so extended may be further extended by subsequent consents in writing made before the expiration of the extended period. d. Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, if any return,
    claim, statement, notice, application, or other document required to be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or before a prescribed date under authority of any provision of this chapter is, after such period
    or such date, delivered by United States mail to the commissioner of finance, the tax appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person with which or with whom such document is required to be filed, or to which or to whom such payment is required
    to be made, the date of the United States postmark stamped on the envelope shall be deemed to be the date of delivery. This subdivision shall apply only if the postmark date falls within the prescribed period or on or before the prescribed date for
    the filing of such document, or for making the payment, including any extension granted for such filing or payment, and only if such document or payment was deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, properly addressed to the commissioner of finance,
    the tax appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person with which or with whom the document is required to be filed or to which or to whom such payment is required to be made. If any document is sent by United States registered mail, such registration
    shall be prima facie evidence that such document was delivered to the commissioner of finance, the tax appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person to which or to whom addressed, and the date of registration shall be deemed the postmark date.
    The commissioner of finance and, where relevant, the tax appeals tribunal are authorized to provide by regulation the extent to which the provisions of the preceding sentence with respect to prima facie evidence of delivery and the postmark date shall
    apply to certified mail. Except as provided in subdivision f of this section, this subdivision shall apply in the case of postmarks not made by the United States postal service only if and to the extent provided by regulation of the commissioner of
    finance or, where relevant, the tax appeals tribunal. Any return filed electronically shall be deemed to be filed on the date of issuance by the commissioner of finance of a confirmation. e. When the last day prescribed under authority of this chapter
    (including any extension of time) for performing any act falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday in the state, the performance of such act shall be considered timely if it is performed on the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday
    or legal holiday. f. (1) Any reference in subdivision d of this section to the United States mail shall be treated as including a reference to any delivery service designated by the secretary of the treasury of the United States pursuant to section
    seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code and any reference in subdivision d of this section to a United States postmark shall be treated as including a reference to any date recorded or marked in the manner described in section seventy-five
    hundred two of the internal revenue code by a designated delivery service. If the commissioner of finance finds that any delivery service designated by such secretary is inadequate for the needs of the city, the commissioner of finance may withdraw
    such designation for purposes of this title. The commissioner of finance may also designate additional delivery services meeting the criteria of section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code for purposes of this title, or may withdraw
    any such designation if the commissioner of finance finds that a delivery service so designated is inadequate for the needs of the city. Any reference in subdivision d of this section to the United States mail shall be treated as including a reference
    to any delivery service designated by the commissioner of finance and any reference in subdivision d of this section to a United States postmark shall be treated as including a reference to any date recorded or marked in the manner described in section
    seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code by a delivery service designated by the commissioner of finance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation or additional designation by the commissioner of finance shall not
    be effective for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal, unless and until such withdrawal of designation or additional designation is ratified by the president of the tax appeals tribunal. (2) Any equivalent of registered or certified mail
    designated by the United States secretary of the treasury, or as may be designated by the commissioner of finance pursuant to the same criteria used by such secretary for such designations pursuant to section seventy-five hundred two of the internal
    revenue code, shall be included within the meaning of registered or certified mail as used in subdivision d of this section. If the commissioner of finance finds that any equivalent of registered or certified mail designated by such secretary or the
    commissioner of finance is inadequate for the needs of the city, the commissioner of finance may withdraw such designation for purposes of this title. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation or additional designation by the commissioner
    of finance shall not be effective for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal, unless and until such withdrawal of designation or additional designation is ratified by the president of the tax appeals tribunal.</span>
