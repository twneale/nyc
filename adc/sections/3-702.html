    with a candidate&#39;s election or nomination without charge; provided however, that none of the foregoing shall be deemed a contribution if it is made, taken or performed by a person or a political committee independent of the candidate or his or her
    agents or political committees authorized by such candidate pursuant to <a href='/adc/sections/14-112.html'>section 14-112</a> of the New York state election law. For purposes of this subdivision, the term &quot;independent of the candidate or his or her agents or political committees authorized
    by such candidate pursuant to <a href='/adc/sections/14-112.html'>section 14-112</a> of the New York state election law&quot; shall mean that the candidate or his or her agents or political committees so authorized by such candidate did not authorize, request, suggest, foster or cooperate in

    the lender&#39;s business shall be deemed, to the extent not repaid by the date of the first covered election in which such candidate is governed by this chapter following the date of the loan, a contribution by the lender. A loan made to a participating
    candidate or his or her principal committee, or a non-participating candidate or his or her authorized committees in the regular course of the lender&#39;s business shall be deemed, to the extent not repaid by the date of the first covered election in

    such term. c. Notwithstanding anything in this subdivision, a person, as defined by subdivision 20 of <a href='/adc/sections/3-702.html'>section 3-702</a>, who has submitted bids or proposals on contracts for the procurement of goods, services or construction or who has submitted bids
    or proposals for franchises or concessions that are no longer being considered for an award or a person who for any other reason believes he or she should not be on the database may apply to the city chief procurement officer or other person designated
    by the mayor for removal from the doing business database and shall be removed from the database upon a determination that said person should not be included in the database. The city chief procurement officer may promulgate rules for a process by
    which a person, as defined by subdivision 20 of <a href='/adc/sections/3-702.html'>section 3-702</a>, may apply to the city chief procurement officer for a waiver from inclusion in the doing business database as defined by such subdivision in instances in which such person is providing
    essential goods, services or construction such as those necessary for security or other essential government operations. Such rules shall provide that the city chief procurement officer shall transmit to the board a copy of any application for a waiver
    and any such waiver may not be granted prior to the expiration of ten days from the date such application is received by the board. Such rules shall also provide that any such waiver may be granted only after substantial efforts have been made by
    the city chief procurement officer to obtain the information required by this law. Such rules shall also provide that the city chief procurement officer may grant the waiver only upon a finding that it is in the best interests of the city, which finding
    shall only be made upon a determination that (i) there is a compelling need to obtain such essential goods, services or construction from the person seeking the exemption and (ii) no other reasonable alternative exists in light of such considerations
    as cost, uniqueness and the critical nature of such goods, services or construction to the accomplishment of the purchasing agency&#39;s mission. Such rules may also provide that a waiver may be granted when a person is doing business with the city by
    virtue of the city&#39;s exercise of its powers of eminent domain. Any grant of a waiver shall be posted on the city&#39;s and the board&#39;s website in locations that are accessible by the public. d. A person, as defined by subdivision 20 of <a href='/adc/sections/3-702.html'>section 3-702</a>,
    shall be considered to have business dealings with the city as of the date the person&#39;s name is entered in the doing business database, as such date is indicated in such database, or the date the person began doing business with the city, as such
    date is indicated in such database, whichever is earlier, except that the date on which the person is considered doing business with the city shall not be earlier than thirty days before the date the person&#39;s name is entered into such database. 19.
