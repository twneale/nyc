                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/adc/sections/20-963.html'>§ 20-963</a> Conduct of shipboard gambling licensees. a. A shipboard gambling licensee shall be in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local statutes, laws, rules and regulations governing operation of a shipboard gambling business, including
    but not limited to: (i) specifications for design and construction, equipment required to be present on board such vessel, maintenance, inspection, documentation, operation and licensing of such vessels; requirements for the medical fitness, training
    and other qualifications, drug testing and licensing of the crew of such vessels; environmental requirements; requirements regarding safety and conditions of employment on such vessel; and requirements for accessibility under the Americans with Disabilities
    Act and any regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, as such regulations may from time to time be amended and analogous provisions of title eight of this code; (ii) prohibitions of gambling activity or the use of gambling devices within the territorial
    waters of the United States or the state of New York; (iii) applicable zoning and building code requirements; (iv) requirements governing the service and provision of food and alcoholic beverages within the territorial waters of the state of New York;
    and (v) health and sanitary regulations. b. A shipboard gambling licensee shall maintain audited financial statements, records, ledgers, receipts, bills and such other records as the commission determines are necessary or useful for carrying out the
    purposes of this chapter. Such records shall be maintained for a period of time not to exceed five years to be determined by rule of the commission, provided, however, that such rule may provide that the commission may, in its discretion, require
    that records be retained for a period of time exceeding five years. Such records shall be made available for inspection and audit by the commission at its request and, at the option of the commission, at either the licensee&#39;s place of business or
    at the offices of the commission. c. A shipboard gambling licensee shall maintain liability and other insurance as prescribed by rule of the commission. d. A shipboard gambling licensee shall, in accordance with rules of the commission, institute
    and maintain security and safety measures and shall provide and maintain such other public services for the welfare of patrons required by such rules. e. A shipboard gambling licensee shall, upon request by a passenger who does not wish to leave the
    vessel carrying cash on his or her person, provide payment of winnings by check. f. A shipboard gambling licensee shall ensure, by means acceptable to the commission and the department of investigation, that all gambling devices and gambling equipment
    on board the vessel are secured or made inoperable during any period the vessel is in the territorial waters of New York and shall comply with all rules promulgated by the commission regarding the maintenance, safeguarding and storage of gambling
    devices. g. A shipboard gambling licensee shall adopt measures to ensure that persons under eighteen years of age do not engage in gambling aboard a vessel operated by or on behalf of such licensee. h. All advertising by a shipboard gambling licensee
    shall prominently state the age restrictions for engaging in gambling aboard the vessel, and shall comply with all rules governing advertising promulgated by the commission. i. A shipboard gambling licensee shall provide access to the vessel(s) operated
    by or on behalf of the shipboard gambling business to any person authorized by <a href='/adc/sections/20-962.html'>section 20-962</a> of this chapter to enforce the provisions of this chapter including, but not limited to, regular and permanent access by any person assigned to such vessel
    by an agency authorized to enforce the provisions of this chapter. j. A shipboard gambling licensee shall not purchase goods or services from a key vendor or an auxiliary vendor unless such vendor has first obtained a license from or registered with
    the commission, whichever is applicable, unless the shipboard gambling licensee has obtained permission from the commission as provided by rule of the commission pursuant to subdivision q of <a href='/adc/sections/20-950.html'>section 20-950</a> of this chapter or the key vendor or auxiliary
    vendor has been granted a waiver pursuant to such subdivision. k. (i) A shipboard gambling licensee shall not employ any person required to obtain a license, certificate of approval or to register pursuant to the provisions of this chapter unless
    such person has obtained such license, certificate of approval or registration; provided, however, that the commission shall, by rule, make provision for temporary permission for employment pending completion by the commission of review of an applicant
    for a certificate of approval or registration and may, in its discretion, permit the employment of a key employee who has not obtained the required license where the employment of such person is necessary for the operation of the shipboard gambling
    business. (ii) The commission may, upon the request of a shipboard gambling business, make available the names of applicants for employment who have been approved for licenses, certificates of approval or registrations. l. A shipboard gambling licensee
    shall demonstrate and ensure for each vessel operated by or on behalf of such licensee, irrespective of the size of the vessel, that (i) every crew member required by the certificate of inspection issued for each such vessel by the United States coast
    guard or the analogous document issued pursuant to the international convention for the safety of lives at sea meets all marine personnel requirements set forth in such certificate or document and holds the applicable documentation, (ii) at least
    sixty-five percent of the required number of crew actually manning the vessel, as set forth in the certificate of inspection issued for each such vessel by the United States coast guard or the analogous document issued pursuant to the international
    convention for the safety of lives at sea, exclusive of those required to be licensed by the United States coast guard or the international maritime organization, have merchant mariners&#39; documents endorsed for a rating of at least able seaman or the
    international maritime equivalent, and (iii) every person employed on each such vessel has received familiarization training consistent with the standards regarding emergency occupational safety, medical care and survival functions set forth in the
    seafarer&#39;s training, certification and watchkeeping code. m. A shipboard gambling licensee shall comply with all additional rules governing conduct of a shipboard gambling business promulgated by the commission in order to effectuate the purposes
    of this chapter.</span>
