A decision of the commissioner shall be subject to judicial review for error, illegality or unconstitutionality at the instance of any taxpayer affected thereby in the manner provided by law
    for the review of a final decision or action of administrative agencies of the city. An application by a taxpayer for such review must be made within four months after notice of the decision is sent by certified or registered mail to the taxpayer.
    (b) Judicial review exclusive remedy of taxpayer. The review of a decision of the commissioner provided by this section shall be exclusive remedy available to any taxpayer for the judicial determination of the liability of the taxpayer for the taxes
    imposed by this chapter. (c) Collection pending review; review bond. Irrespective of any restrictions on the collection of assessments for deficiencies, the commissioner may collect by levy or, otherwise any assessment of a deficiency after the expiration
    of the period specified in subdivision (a) of this section, nothwithstanding that an application for judicial review in respect of such deficiency has been duly made by the taxpayer, unless the taxpayer, at or before the time his or her application
    for review is made, has paid the assessed deficiency, has deposited with the commissioner the amount of the assessed deficiency, or has filed with the commissioner a bond (which may be a jeopardy bond under subdivision (h) of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-1937.html'>section 11-1937</a> of this
    subchapter) in the amount of the portion of the assessed deficiency (including interest and other amounts) in respect of which the application for review is made with surety approved by a justice of the supreme court of the state of New York, conditioned
    upon the payment of the assessed deficiency (including interest and other amounts) as finally determined. If as a result of a waiver of the restrictions on the collection of a deficiency any part of the amount determined by the commissioner is paid
    after the filing of the review bond, such bond shall, at the request of the taxpayer, be proportionately reduced. A similar bond for all costs and charges which may accrue against the taxpayer in the prosecution of such judicial review proceeding
    must be filed with the commissioner before any such proceeding is instituted. (d) Credit, refund or abatement after review. If the amount of a deficiency assessed and determined by the commissioner is disallowed in whole or in part by the court of
    review, the amount so disallowed shall be credited or refunded to the taxpayer, without the making of claim therefor, or, if payment has not been made, shall be abated. (e) Date of finality of commissioner&#39;s decision. A decision of the commissioner
    shall become final upon the expiration of the period specified in subdivision (a) of this section for making an application for review, if no such application has been duly made within such time, or if such application has been duly made, upon expiration
    of the time for all further judicial review, or upon the rendering by the commissioner of a decision in accordance with the mandate of the court on review. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the purpose of making an application for review, the decision
    of the commissioner shall be deemed final on the date the notice of decision is sent by certified or registered mail to the taxpayer.</span>
