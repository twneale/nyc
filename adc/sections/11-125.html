Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the commissioner of finance shall establish a
    three-month amnesty program, to be effective during the fiscal year of the city beginning July first, nineteen hundred ninety-four, for all taxpayers owing any commercial rent or occupancy tax imposed by chapter seven of this title, utility tax imposed
    by chapter eleven of this title, real property transfer tax imposed by chapter twenty-one of this title or hotel room occupancy tax imposed by chapter twenty-five of this title. Such amnesty program shall apply, (1) in the case of the commercial rent
    or occupancy tax, to tax liabilities for tax periods ending on or before May thirty-first, nineteen hundred ninety-three, (2) in the case of the utility tax, to tax liabilities for tax periods ending on or before March thirty-first, nineteen hundred
    ninety-four, (3) in the case of the real property transfer tax, to tax liabilities arising out of taxable events occurring before April first, nineteen hundred ninety-four and (4) in the case of the hotel room occupancy tax, to tax liabilities for
    tax periods ending on or before February twenty-eighth, nineteen hundred ninety-four. Amnesty tax return forms shall be in a form prescribed by the commissioner of finance and shall provide for specifications by the taxpayer of the tax and the taxable
    period or taxable event for which amnesty is being sought. The taxpayer must also provide such additional information as is required by the commissioner of finance. Amnesty shall be granted only for the tax and taxable periods or taxable events specified
    by the taxpayer on such forms (hereinafter referred to as &quot;designated taxes&quot;). b. Such amnesty program shall provide that upon written application by any taxpayer, and upon evidence of payment to the city of New York by such taxpayer of all designated
    taxes plus interest, the commissioner of finance shall waive any penalties which may be applicable, and no civil, administrative or criminal action or proceeding shall be brought against the taxpayer relating to the designated taxes plus interest.
    Failure to pay all designated taxes plus interest shall invalidate any amnesty granted pursuant to this section. c. Amnesty shall not be granted to any taxpayer who is the subject of any criminal investigation being conducted by any agency of the
    city of New York or of the state of New York or any political subdivision thereof or to any taxpayer who is a party to any civil or criminal litigation which is pending on the date of the taxpayer&#39;s application in any court of this state or the United
    States for nonpayment, delinquency or fraud in relation to any of the designated taxes plus interest. A civil litigation shall not be deemed to be pending if the taxpayer withdraws from such litigation prior to the granting of amnesty. d. No refund
    or credit shall be granted of any penalty paid prior to the time the taxpayer makes a request for amnesty pursuant to subdivision b of this section. e. Unless the commissioner of finance on his or her own motion redetermines the amount of designated
    taxes plus interest, no refund or credit shall be granted of any designated taxes plus interest paid under this amnesty program. f. The commissioner of finance shall formulate such rules as are necessary, issue forms and instructions, and take any
    and all other actions necessary to implement the provisions of this section. The commissioner of finance shall publicize the amnesty program provided for herein so as to maximize public awareness of and participation in such program. g. For purposes
    of this section, the term &quot;taxpayer&quot; shall include any person liable for payment of any tax specified in subdivision a of this section. h. For purposes of this section, the amnesty tax return forms and other documents filed by taxpayers for purposes
    of chapter seven, eleven, twenty-one or twenty-five of this title shall be deemed to be reports or returns referred to in <a href='/adc/sections/11-716.html'>section 11-716</a>, 11-1116, 11-2115 or 11-2516, respectively, of this title.</span>
