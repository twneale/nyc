    shall include but not be limited to the following factors: an analysis of ridership numbers, including a breakdown by time of trip, day and month of the year; a review of any recent or anticipated economic development or other economic or population
    changes that have affected or could affect ridership numbers; and plans for future expansion in service and a timeline for such expansion. Every two years thereafter by April 1 the department in consultation with the office of the mayor shall review

    conditions, emergencies or other similar events beyond the control of the department that would prevent compliance with such schedule. In the event of any such disruption in the schedule of service set forth in subdivision a of this section that lasts
    longer than twenty-four hours, the commissioner or a designee shall submit a written report to the mayor and speaker of the council which shall include the specific reasons for the disruption and the time at which service was restored. If service
    has not been restored by the time the report must be submitted, the report shall also include the estimated duration of the disruption in service and what, if any, attempts are being made to mitigate the loss of scheduled service. In the event a disruption
    in the schedule of service lasts longer than seven days, on the eighth day and every seven days thereafter, the commissioner or a designee shall submit a written report to the mayor and speaker of the council that shall include an update on the status
    of resuming service.</span>
