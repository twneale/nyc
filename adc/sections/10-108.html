                    <span class="" style=""><a href='//sections/10-108.html'>§ 10-108</a> Regulation of sound devices or apparatus. a. Legislative declaration. It is hereby declared that the use or operation of any radio device or apparatus or any device or apparatus for the amplification of sounds from any radio, phonograph or
    other sound-making or sound-producing device, or any device or apparatus for the reproduction or amplification of the human voice or other sounds, in front of or outside of any building, place or premises, or in or through any window, doorway or opening
    of such building, place or premises, abutting or adjacent to a public street, park or place, or in or upon any vehicle operated, standing or being in or upon any public street, park or place, where the sounds therefrom may be heard upon any public
    street, park or place, or from any stand, platform or other structure, or from any airplane or other device used for flying, flying over the city, or on a boat or on the waters within the jurisdiction of the city, or anywhere on or in the public streets,
    parks or places, is detrimental to the health, welfare and safety of the inhabitants of the city, in that such use or operation diverts the attention of pedestrians and vehicle operators in the public streets, parks and places, thus increasing traffic
    hazards and causing injury to life and limb. It is hereby further declared that such use or operation disturbs the public peace and comfort and the peaceful enjoyment by the people of their rights to use the public streets, parks and places for street,
    park and other public purposes and disturbs the peace, quiet and comfort of the neighboring inhabitants. Therefore, it is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination that the prohibition of such use or operation for commercial or business
    advertising purposes and the proper regulation of such use and operation for all other purposes is essential to protect the health, welfare and safety of the inhabitants of the city, to secure the health, safety, comfort, convenience, and peaceful
    enjoyment by the people of their rights to use the public streets, parks and places for street, park and other public purposes and to secure the peace, quiet and comfort of the city&#39;s inhabitants. It is hereby further declared as a matter of legislative
    determination that the expense of supervising and regulating the use and operation of such sound devices and apparatus for purposes other than commercial and business advertising purposes should be borne by the persons using or operating such devices
    and apparatus and that the requirement of a nominal fee for the issuance of a permit for such use and operation as hereinafter prescribed is intended to defray the expenses of regulating such use or operation for the health, welfare and safety of
    all the people. b. Definitions. As used in this section: 1. The term &quot;public holidays&quot; shall mean those days expressly set forth in section twenty-four of the general construction law. 2. The term &quot;sound device or apparatus&quot; shall mean any radio device
    or apparatus, or any device or apparatus for the amplification of any sounds from any radio, phonograph, or other sound-making or sound-producing device, or any device or apparatus for the reproduction or amplification of the human voice or other
    sounds; 3. The phrase &quot;to use or operate any sound device or apparatus in, on, near or adjacent to any public street, park or place,&quot; shall mean to use or operate or cause to be used or operated any sound device or apparatus in front or outside of
    any building, place or premises, or in or through any window, doorway or opening of such building, place or premises, abutting on or adjacent to a public street, park or place, or in or upon any vehicle operated, standing or being in or on any public
    street, park or place, where the sounds therefrom may be heard upon any public street, park or place, or from any stand, platform or other structure, or from any other airplane or other device used for flying, flying over the city, or on a boat or
    on the waters within the jurisdiction of the city, or anywhere on the public streets, parks or places. c. Use and operation of the sound devices and apparatus for commercial and business advertising purposes. It shall be unlawful for any person to
    use or operate any sound device or apparatus in, on, near or adjacent to any public street, park or place, for commercial and business advertising purpose. d. Use and operation of sound devices and apparatus for other than commercial and business
    advertising purposes; permit required. It shall be unlawful for any person to use or operate any sound device or apparatus, in, on, near or adjacent to any public street, park or place, unless such person shall have first obtained a permit to be issued
    by the police commissioner in the manner hereinafter prescribed and unless the police commissioner shall comply with the provisions of this section and the terms and conditions prescribed in such permit. e. Applications. Each applicant for a permit
    to use or operate a sound device or apparatus in, on, near or adjacent to any public street, park or place shall file a written application with the police commissioner, at the police precinct covering the area in which such sound device or apparatus
    is to be used or operated, at least five days prior to the date upon which such sound device or apparatus is to be used or operated. Such application shall describe the specific location in which such sound device or apparatus is proposed to be used
    or operated, the day and the hour or hours during which it is proposed to be used or operated, the volume of sound which is proposed to be used measured by decibels or by any other efficient method of measuring sound, and such other pertinent information
    as the police commissioner may deem necessary to enable the police commissioner to carry out the provisions of this section. f. Issuance of permit; terms. The police commissioner shall not deny a permit for any specific time, location or use, to any
    applicant who complies with the provisions of this section, except for one or more of the reasons specified in subdivision g hereof or for non-payment of the fee prescribed in subdivision h hereof, or to prevent overlapping in the granting of permits,
    provided, however, that a permit issued for multiple days shall be issued only for multiple days within a period of five consecutive calendar days and only at the same location. Each permit issued pursuant to this section shall describe the specific
    location in which such sound device or apparatus may be used or operated thereunder, the exact period of time for which such apparatus or device may be operated in such location, the maximum volume of sound which may be employed in such use or operation
    and such other terms and conditions as may be necessary, for the purpose of securing the health, safety, comfort, convenience and peaceful enjoyment by the people of their right to use the public streets, parks or places for street, park or other
    public purposes, protecting the health, welfare and safety of the inhabitants of the city, and securing the peace, quiet and comfort of the neighboring inhabitants. g. Special restrictions. The police commissioner shall not issue any permit for the
    use of a sound device or apparatus: 1. In any location within five hundred feet of a school, courthouse or church, during the hours of school, court or worship, respectively, or within five hundred feet of any hospital or similar institution; 2. In
    any location where the commissioner, upon investigation, shall determine that the conditions of vehicular or pedestrian traffic or both are such that the use of such a device or apparatus will constitute a threat to the safety of pedestrians or vehicular
    operators; 3. In any location where the commissioner, upon investigation, shall determine that conditions of overcrowding or of street repair or other physical conditions are such that the use of a sound device or apparatus will deprive the public
    of the right to the safe, comfortable, convenient and peaceful enjoyment of any public street, park or place for street, park or other public purposes, or will constitute a threat to the safety of pedestrians or vehicle operators; 4. In or on any
    vehicle or other device while it is in transit; 5. Between the hours of ten p. m. and nine a. m.; or 6. Between the hours of eight p.m. or sunset, whichever is later, and nine a.m. on weekdays and between the hours of eight p.m. or sunset, whichever
    is later, and ten a.m. on weekends and public holidays, in any location within fifty feet of any building that is lawfully occupied for residential use. The distance of fifty feet shall be measured in a straight line from the point on the exterior
    wall of such building nearest to any point in the location for which the permit is sought. h. Fees. Each applicant for a single-day permit issued under the provisions of this section shall pay a fee of forty-five dollars for the use of each such sound
    device or apparatus and each applicant for a multiple-day permit issued under the provisions of this section shall pay a fee of forty-five dollars for the use of each such sound device or apparatus for the first day and a fee of five dollars for the
    use of each such sound device or apparatus for each additional day up to a maximum of four additional days, provided, however, that permits for the use of such sound devices or apparatus shall be issued to any bureau, commission, board or department
    of the United States government, the state of New York, and the city of New York, without fee. i. Exceptions. The provisions of this section shall not apply to the use or operation of any sound device or apparatus by any church or synagogue on or
    within its own premises, in connection with the religious rites or ceremonies of such church or synagogue. j. Violations. 1. Any person who shall violate any provision of this section, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine of not more
    than one hundred dollars or imprisonment for thirty days, or both. 2. Any person who shall violate any provision of this section, any rule promulgated pursuant thereto or the terms of a permit issued pursuant to subdivision f of this section, shall
    be liable for a civil penalty recoverable in a civil action brought in the name of the police commissioner or the commissioner of environmental protection or in a proceeding before the environmental control board in an amount of two hundred fifty
    dollars for the first violation, five hundred dollars for the second violation and seven hundred fifty dollars for the third and each subsequent violation. However, any person who commits a fourth and any subsequent violation within a period of six
    months shall be classified as a persistent violator and shall be liable for a civil penalty of one thousand dollars for each such violation. k. Rules. The police commissioner shall have the power to make such rules as may be necessary to carry out
