                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/adc/sections/20-674.html'>§ 20-674</a> Violations. a. (1) Any person who violates the provisions of this subchapter or any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder, other than sections 20-673.1 and 20-673.2 and any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder, shall be guilty
    of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not less than five hundred dollars nor more than ten thousand dollars, or by imprisonment for not more than thirty days, or by both such fine and imprisonment. (2) Any person who violates the provisions of
    this subchapter or any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder, other than sections 20-673.1 and 20-673.2 and any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder, who has been found guilty of a violation of any such sections or such rules or regulations
    two times within the preceding twenty-four month period shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not less than one thousand dollars nor more than fifteen thousand dollars, or by imprisonment for not more than ninety days, or by both
    such fine and imprisonment. (3) In addition to the penalties prescribed by paragraph one of subdivision a of this section, any person who violates the provisions of this subchapter or any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder, other than sections
    20-673.1 and 20-673.2 and any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder, shall be liable for a civil penalty of not less than five hundred dollars nor more than ten thousand dollars. (4) In addition to the penalties prescribed by paragraph two of
    subdivision a of this section, any person who violates the provisions of this subchapter or any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder, other than sections 20-673.1 and 20-673.2 and any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder, who has been
    found guilty of a violation of any such sections or such rules or regulations two times within the preceding twenty-four month period shall be liable for a civil penalty of not less than one thousand dollars nor more than fifteen thousand dollars.
    b. Any person who violates the provisions of <a href='/adc/sections/20-673.1.html'>section 20-673.1</a> of this subchapter or any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder shall be liable for a civil penalty of not less than five hundred dollars nor more than ten thousand dollars. c. (1)
    If, after providing due notice and an opportunity to be heard, the commissioner finds that a person has violated any of the provisions of <a href='/adc/sections/20-673.2.html'>section 20-673.2</a> of this subchapter or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder, he or she shall be authorized
    to issue and serve upon such person an order requiring such person to cease and desist from engaging in the prohibited activity. Such order shall become final (i) upon the expiration of the time allowed for filing any administrative appeal which may
    be available and for commencing a proceeding pursuant to article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules or (ii) upon the exhaustion of all appeals arising out of the proceedings described in item (i) of this paragraph. Any person who violates
    an order of the commissioner issued hereunder after it has become final shall be liable for a civil penalty of not less than five hundred dollars nor more than ten thousand dollars for each violation. (2) Any person who violates the provisions of
    <a href='/adc/sections/20-673.2.html'>section 20-673.2</a> of this subchapter or any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder with actual knowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective circumstances that the act or practice underlying the violation is unfair or deceptive
    shall be liable for a civil penalty of not less than five hundred dollars nor more than ten thousand dollars; provided, however, that in order for any retailer to be held liable under this paragraph for violating any of the provisions of subdivisions
    d or e of such <a href='/adc/sections/20-673.2.html'>section 20-673.2</a>, such retailer shall be shown to have had actual knowledge that the act or practice underlying the violation is unfair or deceptive. In determining the amount of any civil penalty imposed under this paragraph, the following
    shall be considered: the degree of culpability; any history of prior such conduct; ability to pay; effect on ability to continue to do business; and such other matters as justice may require. d. In the case of a violation through continuing failure
    to comply with any of the provisions of this subchapter, any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder, or any order of the commissioner issued pursuant to subdivision c of this section, each day of the continuance of such failure shall be treated
    as a separate violation. e. The civil penalties prescribed by the provisions of this section may be imposed by the commissioner after due notice and an opportunity to be heard have been provided or may be recovered in a civil action in the name of
    the city, commenced in a court of competent jurisdiction. In any civil action commenced to recover civil penalties for violation of a final order of the commissioner issued pursuant to subdivision c of this section, the supreme court of New York is
    empowered to grant such injunctive or equitable relief as the court deems appropriate in the enforcement of such final order. f. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the commissioner shall cause to be published in the City Record once each month the name
    and business location of any person, firm or corporation that has been found to have violated any provision of sections 20-673.1 or 20-673.2 during the month immediately preceding.</span>
