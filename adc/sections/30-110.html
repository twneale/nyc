The commissioner, in consultation with relevant federal, state and local agencies, shall develop or update a plan no later than December first, two thousand thirteen for the tracking of persons in special medical

    the ability of agencies responding to an emergency to implement plans, modify plans, or take steps not described in any written plan, in a manner appropriate to circumstances particular to that emergency: a. a mechanism to adequately track persons
    who enter or exit a special medical needs shelter; b. a mechanism for the dissemination of bracelets or other wearable identification devices to be used on a voluntary basis by any person entering a special medical needs shelter if such device has
    not been provided by the state, which shall include to the extent permitted by state and federal law such person&#39;s name, address, emergency contact information, and information provided regarding the medical needs of such person, or an identification
    number or other identifier that will enable the shelter operator to locate such information; c. a mechanism to track the medical needs of any person using a special medical needs shelter if such mechanism has not been provided by the state and to
    the extent information regarding such medical needs is available, including but not limited to needed medications; d. a mechanism for enabling persons who use special medical needs shelters and who do not object to disclosure of their location to
    be contacted by their family members and guardians, including the establishment of a designated point of contact for such information and a description of how such mechanism will be publicized; and e. a mechanism for consulting community based organizations
