                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/nyc/adc/sections/19-702.html'>§ 19-702</a> Legislative findings and intent. The Council hereby finds that the city of New York&#39;s water borne commuter services facilities are not uniformly accessible to disabled persons. This is a matter of serious concern affecting the public safety
    and welfare. The Council believes that there is an immediate need for regulation of water borne commuter services in order to enable disabled members of the public to have access to such services on an equal basis with non-disabled persons. The Council
    believes that under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), disabled persons have the right to access commuter transportation services on an equal and non-discriminatory basis. However, the Council finds that no federal or state laws, rules or
    regulations are in effect that establish specific standards regarding access by disabled persons to water borne commuter services facilities in the city or the safety of such persons when utilizing such facilities. As a result, disabled persons in
    the city of New York are not assured that they can safely and consistently access water borne commuter services facilities. This legislation sets specific standards in relation to mandating accessible water borne commuter services facilities for disabled
    persons, thereby minimizing the tremendous and unfair burden placed on disabled persons who rely on these services. The Council further finds that the city&#39;s transportation needs and system are unique in that, unlike many other cities, major waterways
    are interspersed throughout the greater New York city area, resulting in residential concentrations that are in many instances separated by water from major centers of employment. Consequently, the city historically has had an extensive passenger
    ferry system. Furthermore, because of increasing levels of traffic congestion and air pollution, and concerns regarding the threat of terrorism to other modes of transportation, the city is rapidly developing an increasingly expansive system of passenger
    ferry transportation. The Council finds that it is imperative that such development results in water borne commuter services facilities that are accessible to all persons.</span>
