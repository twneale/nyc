                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/adc/sections/11-260.html'>§ 11-260</a> Application for certificate of eligibility. a. Application for a certificate of eligibility pursuant to this part may be made immediately and continuing until June 30, 2008; provided, however, that application for a certificate of eligibility
    for renovation construction work for property located in the renovation exemption area specified in subparagraph (b) of paragraph (4) of subdivision d of <a href='/adc/sections/11-258.html'>section 11-258</a> of this part may not be made after January 31, 1995; provided, further, however,
    that application for a certificate of eligibility for construction of a new building or structure that meets the requirements set forth in subdivision i of <a href='/adc/sections/11-259.html'>section 11-259</a> of this part in the new construction exemption area specified in paragraph (1)
    of subdivision e of <a href='/adc/sections/11-258.html'>section 11-258</a> of this part may not be made after December 31, 1996; provided, further, however, that application for a certificate of eligibility for construction of a new building or structure that meets the requirements set
    forth in subdivision i of <a href='/adc/sections/11-259.html'>section 11-259</a> of this part in the new construction exemption area specified in paragraph (2) of subdivision e of <a href='/adc/sections/11-258.html'>section 11-258</a> of this part may not be made after June 30, 2003. Such application shall state whether it is
    for industrial, commercial or renovation construction work, and shall be filed with the department of finance. In addition to any other information required by such department, the application shall include cost estimates or bids for the proposed
    construction and an affidavit of a professional engineer or architect of the applicant&#39;s choice, certifying that detailed plans for the construction work have been submitted to the department of buildings. Such application shall also state that the
    applicant agrees to comply with and be subject to the rules issued from time to time by the department of finance to secure compliance with all applicable city, state and federal laws or which implement mayoral directives and executive orders designed
    to ensure equal employment opportunity. Such application shall also certify that all taxes currently due and owing on the property which is the subject of the application have been paid or are currently being paid in timely installments pursuant to
    written agreement with the department of finance. b. The burden of proof shall be on the applicant to show by clear and convincing evidence that the requirements for granting an exemption from or abatement or deferral of payment of taxes pursuant
    to this part have been satisfied. The department of finance shall have the authority to require that statements in connection with the application be made under oath. c. Upon receipt of an application, the department of finance shall send written
    notice thereof to the council member representing the district where the proposed construction work is to take place. d. The department of finance shall issue a certificate of eligibility upon determining that the applicant satisfies the requirements
    for industrial, commercial or renovation construction work in an area where benefits are available for such work. Such certificate shall state whether such benefits are to be granted for industrial, commercial or renovation construction work, and
    in which class of area the property is located. The effective date of such certificate, except as provided in paragraph (2) or paragraph (4) of subdivision c of <a href='/adc/sections/11-259.html'>section 11-259</a> of this part, shall be the earlier of (1) the date on which a building
    permit for the construction work is issued by the department of buildings, or (2) the last day before the effective date of any designation of boundaries by the commission which changes the class of area in which the property is located so as to reduce
    the level of benefits for commercial construction work on such property. Where the effective date of the certificate of eligibility is July 1, 1992 or after, the benefits granted for industrial, commercial or renovation construction work pursuant
    to this part shall be in accordance with the provisions of this part as amended by local law number 73 for the year 1992, local law number 40 for the year 1994, local law number 58 for the year 1995, local law number 44 for the year 1999, local law
    number 48 for the year 2003 and the local law for the year 2007 that added this clause. Where the effective date of the certificate of eligibility is June 30, 1992 or before, the benefits granted for industrial or commercial construction work pursuant
    to this part shall be in accordance with the provisions of this part as it was in effect until June 30, 1992 immediately prior to its amendment by local law number 73 for the year 1992. No recipient whose property is the subject of a certificate of
    eligibility for commercial construction work in a deferral area shall be eligible to apply for a certificate of eligibility for renovation construction work on the same property, where the renovation construction work is the same as, or similar to,
    the commercial construction work for which the deferral area certificate was issued, until three years after the effective date of the deferral area certificate. No recipient shall receive a tax deferral and a tax exemption for the same expenditure
    on eligible construction work. e. A copy of the certificate of eligibility shall be filed by the department of finance in the manner prescribed for recording a mortgage pursuant to section two hundred ninety-one-d of the real property law. f. The
    department of finance may provide by rule for reasonable administrative charges or fees necessary to defray expenses in administering the benefit program provided by this part.</span>
