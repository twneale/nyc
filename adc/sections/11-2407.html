                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-2407.html'>§ 11-2407</a> Determination of tax. If a return required by this chapter is not filed, or if a return when filed is incorrect or insufficient, the commissioner shall determine the amount of tax due from such information as may be obtainable and, if necessary,
    may estimate the tax on the basis of external indices. Notice of such determination shall be given to the person liable for the payment of the tax. Such determination shall finally and irrevocably fix the tax unless the person against whom it is assessed,
    within ninety days after the giving of notice of such determination, or, if the commissioner of finance has established a conciliation procedure pursuant to <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-124.html'>section 11-124</a> of the code and the taxpayer has requested a conciliation conference in accordance
    therewith, within ninety days from the mailing of a conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner&#39;s confirmation of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding, both (1) serves a petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2) files
    a petition with the tax appeals tribunal for a hearing, or unless the commissioner of his or her own motion shall redetermine the same. Such hearing and any appeal to the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc from the decision rendered in such hearing
    shall be conducted in the manner and subject to the requirements prescribed by the tax appeals tribunal pursuant to sections one hundred sixty-eight through one hundred seventy-two of the charter. After such hearing the tax appeals tribunal shall
    give notice of its decision to the person against whom the tax is assessed and to the commissioner of finance. A decision of the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc shall be reviewable for error, illegality or unconstitutionality or any other reason
    whatsoever by a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules if application therefor is made to the supreme court by the person against whom the tax was assessed within four months after the giving of the notice of such
    tax appeals tribunal decision. A proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules shall not be instituted by a taxpayer unless: (a) the amount of any tax sought to be reviewed, with penalties and interest thereon, if any,
    shall be first deposited with the commissioner and there shall be filed with the commissioner an undertaking issued by a surety company authorized to transact business in this state and approved by the superintendent of insurance of this state as
    to solvency and responsibility, in such amount as a justice of the supreme court shall approve, to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the taxpayer will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution
    of the proceedings or (b) at the option of the taxpayer, such undertaking may be in a sum sufficient to cover the taxes, interest and penalties stated in such decision, plus the costs and charges which may accrue against it in the prosecution of the
    proceeding, in which event the taxpayer shall not be required to pay such taxes, interest or penalties as a condition precedent to the application.
