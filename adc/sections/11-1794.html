                    <span class="" style=""><a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-1794.html'>§ 11-1794</a> Jeopardy assessment. (a) Authority for making. If the tax commission believes that the assessment or collection of a deficiency will be jeopardized by delay, it shall, notwithstanding the provisions of sections 11-1781 and 11-1796, immediately
    assess such deficiency (together with all interest, penalties and additions to tax provided for by law), and notice and demand shall be made by the tax commission for the payment thereof. (b) Notice of deficiency. If the jeopardy assessment is made
    before any notice in respect of the tax to which the jeopardy assessment relates has been mailed under <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-1781.html'>section 11-1781</a>, then the tax commission shall mail a notice under such section within sixty days after the making of the assessment. (c) Amount
    assessable before decision of tax commission. The jeopardy assessment may be made in respect of a deficiency greater or less than that of which notice is mailed to the taxpayer and whether or not the taxpayer has theretofore filed a petition with
    the tax commission. The tax commission may, at any time before rendering its decision, abate such assessment, or any unpaid portion thereof, to the extent that it believes the assessment to be excessive in amount. The tax commission may in its decision
    redetermine the entire amount of the deficiency and of all amounts assessed at the same time in connection therewith. (d) Amount assessable after decision of tax commission. If the jeopardy assessment is made after the decision of the tax commission
    is rendered, such assessment may be made only in respect of the deficiency determined by the tax commission in its decision. (e) Expiration of right to assess. A jeopardy assessment may not be made after the decision of the tax commission has become
    final or after the taxpayer has made an application for review of the decision of the tax commission. (f) Collection of unpaid amounts. When a petition has been filed with the tax commission and when the amount which should have been assessed has
    been determined by a decision of the tax commission which has become final, then any unpaid portion, the collection of which has been stayed by bond, shall be collected as part of the tax upon notice and demand from the tax commission, and any remaining
    portion of the assessment shall be abated. If the amount already collected exceeds the amount determined as the amount which should have been assessed, such excess shall be credited or refunded to the taxpayer as provided in <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-1786.html'>section 11-1786</a> without
    the filing of claim therefor. If the amount determined as the amount which should have been assessed is greater than the amount actually assessed, then the difference shall be assessed and shall be collected as part of the tax upon notice and demand
    from the tax commission. (g) Abatement if jeopardy does not exist. The tax commission may abate the jeopardy assessment if it finds that jeopardy does not exist. Such abatement may not be made after a decision of the tax commission in respect of the
    deficiency has been rendered or, if no petition is filed with the tax commission, after the expiration of the period for filing such petition. The period of limitation on the making of assessments and levy or a proceeding for collection, in respect
    of any deficiency, shall be determined as if the jeopardy assessment so abated had not been made, except that the running of such period shall in any event be suspended for the period from the date of such jeopardy assessment until the expiration
    of the tenth day after the day on which such jeopardy assessment is abated. (h) Bond to stay collection. The collection of the whole or any amount of any jeopardy assessment may be stayed by filing with the tax commission, within such time as may
    be fixed by regulation, a bond in an amount equal to the amount as to which the stay is desired, conditioned upon the payment of the amount (together with interest thereon) the collection of which is stayed at the time at which, but for the making
    of the jeopardy assessment, such amount would be due. Upon the filing of the bond the collection of so much of the amount assessed as is covered by the bond shall be stayed. The taxpayer shall have the right to waive such stay at any time in respect
    of the whole or any part of the amount covered by the bond, and if as a result of such waiver any part of the amount covered by the bond is paid, then the bond shall at the request of the taxpayer, be proportionately reduced. If any portion of the
    jeopardy assessment is abated, or if a notice of deficiency under <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-1781.html'>section 11-1781</a> is mailed to the taxpayer in a lesser amount, the bond shall, at the request of the taxpayer, be proportionately reduced. (i) Petition to tax commission. If the bond
    is given before the taxpayer has filed his or her petition under <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-1789.html'>section 11-1789</a>, the bond shall contain a further condition that if a petition is not filed within the period provided in such section, then the amount, the collection of which is stayed
    by the bond, will be paid on notice and demand at any time after the expiration of such period, together with interest thereon from the date of the jeopardy notice and demand to the date of notice and demand under this subdivision. The bond shall
    be conditioned upon the payment of so much of such assessment (collection of which is stayed by the bond) as is not abated by a decision of the tax commission which has become final. If the tax commission determines that the amount assessed is greater
    than the amount which should have been assessed, then the bond shall, at the request of the taxpayer, be proportionately reduced when the decision of the tax commission is rendered. (j) Stay of sale of seized property pending tax commission decision.
    Where a jeopardy assessment is made, the property seized for the collection of the tax shall not be sold: (1) if subdivision (b) of this section is applicable, prior to the issuance of the notice of deficiency and the expiration of the time provided
    in <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-1789.html'>section 11-1789</a> for filing a petition with the tax commission, and (2) if a petition is filed with the tax commission (whether before or after the making of such jeopardy assessment), prior to the expiration of the period during which the assessment
    of the deficiency would be prohibited if subdivision (a) of this section were not applicable. Such property may be sold if the taxpayer consents to the sale, or if the tax commission determines that the expenses of conservation and maintenance will
    greatly reduce the net proceeds, or if the property is perishable. (k) Interest. For the purpose of subdivision (a) of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-1784.html'>section 11-1784</a>, the last date prescribed for payment shall be determined without regard to any notice and demand for payment issued
    under this section prior to the last date otherwise prescribed for such payment. (l) Early termination of taxable year. If the tax commission finds that a taxpayer designs quickly to depart from this state or to remove his or her property therefrom,
    or to conceal himself or herself or his or her property therein, or to do any other act tending to prejudice or to render wholly or partly ineffectual proceedings to collect the city personal income tax for the current or the preceding taxable year
    unless such proceedings be brought without delay, the tax commission shall declare the taxable period for such taxpayer immediately terminated, and shall cause notice of such finding and declaration to be given the taxpayer, together with a demand
    for immediate payment of the tax for the taxable period so declared terminated and of the tax for the preceding taxable year or so much of such tax as is unpaid, whether or not the time otherwise allowed by law for filing return and paying the tax
    has expired; and such taxes shall thereupon become immediately due and payable. In any proceeding brought to enforce payment of taxes made due and payable by virtue of the provisions of this subdivision, the finding of the tax commission made as herein
    provided, whether made after notice to the taxpayer or not, shall be for all purposes presumptive evidence of jeopardy. (m) Reopening of taxable period. Notwithstanding the termination of the taxable period of the taxpayer by the tax commission, as
    provided in subdivision (1), the tax commission may reopen such taxable period each time the taxpayer is found by the tax commission to have received income, within the current taxable year, since the termination of such period. A taxable period so
    terminated by the tax commission may be reopened by the taxpayer if he or she files with the tax commission a true and accurate return of taxable income and credits allowed under this chapter for such taxable period, together with such other information
    as the tax commission may by regulations prescribe. (n) Furnishing of bond where taxable year is closed by the tax commission. Payment of taxes shall not be enforced by any proceedings under the provisions of subdivision (1) of this section prior
    to the expiration of the time otherwise allowed for paying such taxes if the taxpayer furnishes, under regulations prescribed by the tax commission, a bond to insure the timely making of returns with respect to, and payment of, such taxes or any city
    personal income taxes for prior years.
