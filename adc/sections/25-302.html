    shall be the current assessed valuation established by the city, which is in effect at the time of the filing of the request for a certificate of appropriateness; provided that: (a) The commission may make a determination that the valuation of the
    improvement parcel is an amount different from such assessed valuation where there has been a reduction in the assessed valuation for the year next preceding the effective date of the current assessed valuation in effect at the time of the filing
    of such request; and (b) The commission may make a determination that the value of the improvement parcel is an amount different from the assessed valuation where there has been a bona fide sale of such parcel within the period between March fifteenth,
    nineteen hundred fifty-eight, and the time of the filing of such request, as the result of a transaction at arm&#39;s length, on normal financing terms, at a readily ascertainable price, and unaffected by special circumstances such as, but not limited
    to, a forced sale, exchange of property, package deal, wash sale or sale to a cooperative. In determining whether a sale was on normal financing terms, the commission shall give due consideration to the following factors: (1) The ratio of the cash
    payment received by the seller to (a) the sales price of the improvement parcel and (b) the annual gross income from such parcel; (2) The total amount of the outstanding mortgages which are liens against the improvement parcel (including purchase
    money mortgages) as compared with the assessed valuation of such parcel; (3) The ratio of the sales price to the annual gross income of the improvement parcel, with consideration given, where the improvement is subject to residential rent control,
    to the total amount of rent adjustments previously granted, exclusive of rent adjustments because of changes in dwelling space, services, furniture, furnishings, or equipment, major capital improvements, or substantial rehabilitation; (4) The presence
    of deferred amortization in purchase money mortgages, or the assignment of such mortgages at a discount; (5) Any other facts and circumstances surrounding such sale which, in the judgment of the commission, may have a bearing upon the question of
    financing. (3) For the purposes of this subdivision v: (a) Net annual return shall be the amount by which the earned income yielded by the improvement parcel during a test year exceeds the operating expenses of such parcel during such year, excluding
    mortgage interest and amortization, and excluding allowances for obsolescence and reserves, but including an allowance for depreciation of two per centum of the assessed value of the improvement, exclusive of the land, or the amount shown for depreciation
    of the improvement in the latest required federal income tax return, whichever is lower; provided, however, that no allowance for depreciation of the improvement shall be included where the improvement has been fully depreciated for federal income
    tax purposes or on the books of the owner; and (b) Test year shall be (1) the most recent full calendar year, or (2) the owner&#39;s most recent fiscal year, or (3) any twelve consecutive months ending not more than ninety days prior to the filing (a)
    of the request for a certificate, or (b) of an application for a renewal of tax benefits pursuant to the provisions of <a href='//sections/25-309.html'>section 25-309</a> of this chapter, as the case may be. w. &quot;Scenic landmark.&quot; Any landscape feature or aggregate of landscape features,

    fence, railing, porch, balcony or roof, including dormers, bays, gables and parapets; and (vi) a storefront, but not including the installation of signs, awnings, flagpoles or banners; (b) the removal of or alterations to a significant portion of
    a protected feature of an interior landmark as described in the designation report; (c) the construction of all or a portion of a new building, structure, addition or any other improvement on a landmark site or within the boundaries of a historic
    district. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any significant modification of the existing bulk or envelope of a building shall be a violation under this paragraph; (d) the elimination by paving or other construction of a significant
    portion of an area-way, planting area, or front, rear or side yards, where such feature is a significant component of the landmark or historic district; (e) where the improvement is not a building or an interior landmark, the removal of or alterations

    of this chapter, and where such condition results or may result in significant deterioration of either a significant portion of the improvement or a character-defining, protected, architectural feature of such improvement. (a) For purposes of this
    subdivision, and without limiting the scope thereof, the term &quot;significant deterioration&quot; shall include the failure to maintain: (i) the improvement in a structurally sound or reasonably water-tight condition; or (ii) a character-defining, protected,
    architectural feature in a structurally sound or reasonably water-tight condition or otherwise failing to preserve the integral historic material of such feature. (b) For purposes of this subdivision, the term &quot;significant deterioration&quot; shall not
    include: (i) any condition that may permit some water penetration and/or evidence slight structural deterioration, unless such condition has existed over a period of time such that it has led or may reasonably lead to significant water penetration
    or structural damage to a significant part of a facade or roof; or (ii) the failure to maintain a small part of a single, character-defining, protected, architectural feature or a small portion of the decorative, architectural features of the improvement
    taken as a whole. (3) &quot;Type C violation&quot;. All other violations of this chapter, except for violations of <a href='//sections/25-311.html'>section 25-311</a> of this chapter.</span>
