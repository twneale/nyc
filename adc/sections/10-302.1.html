    other entity, it shall be considered to have been acquired by each natural person who is an officer, director or other principal of such entity, unless the firearm, rifle or shotgun is acquired on behalf of such entity by a person who is licensed
    by the commissioner as gun custodian or special gun custodian, or acquired on behalf of an organization possessing an organization registration certificate, as those terms are used in title thirty-eight of the rules of the city of New York. c. Before
    disposing of any firearm, rifle or shotgun to a person licensed by the commissioner to possess firearms, rifles or shotguns, any dealer in firearms, dealer in rifles and shotguns or other person shall contact the police department to ensure compliance
    with the requirements of this section. d. Any dealer in firearms, dealer in rifles and shotguns or other person who disposes of any firearm, rifle or shotgun to a person licensed by an authority other than the commissioner to possess firearms, rifles
    or shotguns shall make reasonable efforts to contact such licensing authority and to ascertain the most recent date of acquisition by such licensee of a firearm, in the case of disposition of a firearm, or of a rifle or shotgun, in the case of disposition
    of a rifle or shotgun. e. Any dealer in firearms or dealer in rifles or shotguns who disposes of any firearm, rifle or shotgun shall, before or at the time of disposing of such firearm, rifle or shotgun, record, in the record book required to be kept
    by subdivision n of <a href='/adc/sections/10-302.html'>section 10-302</a>, the efforts made by such dealer to ensure compliance with the requirements of this section, any exception or exemption set forth in this section that such dealer reasonably believes would authorize the disposal
    of such firearm, rifle or shotgun, and the grounds for such dealer&#39;s belief that such exception or exemption applies. f. Exceptions. The provisions of this section shall not apply to the sale of firearms, rifles or shotguns to (i) a police officer,

    transport, installation and testing under the requirements of such contract, (vii) peace officers as defined in section 2.10 of the criminal procedure law, provided that such peace officers are authorized pursuant to law or regulation of the state
    or city of New York to possess a firearm, rifle or shotgun within the city of New York without a license or permit therefor, and are authorized by their employer to possess such firearm, rifle or shotgun, (viii) persons licensed as dealers, manufacturers
    or importers of firearms pursuant to chapter 44 of title 18 of the United States Code, (ix) any motion picture, television or video production company or entertainment or theatrical company whose production involves the use of firearms, rifles or
    shotguns, provided that such weapons shall be properly registered and a special theatrical permit shall have been issued for such weapons pursuant to rules established by the commissioner, (x) with respect to the sale of firearms only, persons licensed
    by the commissioner as gun custodians or special gun custodians, as those terms are used in title thirty-eight of the rules of the city of New York, and (xi) with respect to the sale of rifles and shotguns only, organizations possessing an organization
    registration certificate, as that term is used in title thirty-eight of the rules of the city of New York. g. Exempt transactions. The requirements of this section shall not apply to: (i) any transaction in which a person acquires a firearm, rifle
    or shotgun by operation of law, or because of the death of another person for whom such person is an executor or administrator of an estate or a trustee of a trust created in a will, provided that within fifteen days such person surrenders such firearm,
    rifle or shotgun to the commissioner until it can be reacquired without violation of this section or other applicable law. If a firearm, rifle or shotgun is surrendered pursuant to this subdivision but no written request to reacquire it is received
    by the commissioner within two years of such surrender, the commissioner shall dispose of such firearm in accordance with the provisions of section 400.05 of the penal law; (ii) the exchange of a firearm, rifle or shotgun by a dealer in firearms or
    a dealer in rifles and shotguns for another firearm, rifle or shotgun previously purchased from such dealer by the person requesting such exchange, provided that such exchange takes place within thirty days of such request; (iii) the acquisition or
    disposal of an antique firearm, rifle or shotgun which is incapable of being fired or discharged or which does not fire fixed ammunition, or a firearm, rifle or shotgun manufactured prior to eighteen hundred ninety-four or whose design was patented
    and whose commercial manufacture commenced prior to eighteen hundred ninety-four and whose manufacture continued after such year without any substantial alteration in design or function, and for which cartridge ammunition is not commercially available
    and is possessed as a curiosity or ornament or for its historical significance and value; (iv) the acquisition or disposal of a firearm at an indoor or outdoor pistol range when such acquisition or disposal begins a period of possession or use of
    the firearm that is authorized by paragraphs 7-a, 7-b, or 7-e of subdivision a of section 265.20 of the penal law; (v) the sale of a firearm by a dealer in firearms to a person whose firearm is stolen or irretrievably lost, provided that: (1) such
    person has complied with any legal requirement to report the loss or theft, including but not limited to the applicable provisions of title thirty-eight of the rules of the city of New York and section 400.10 of the penal law; (2) such person provides
    to such dealer a copy of a police report of the loss or theft or of any report made pursuant to the applicable provisions of title thirty-eight of the rules of the city of New York and section 400.10 of the penal law, which copy the dealer shall attach
    to the record book required to be kept by subdivision n of <a href='/adc/sections/10-302.html'>section 10-302</a>; (3) the copy provided pursuant to subparagraph two of this paragraph contains the name and address of the regulated firearm owner, a description of the regulated firearm, the
    location of the loss or theft, if known, the date of the loss or theft, if known, and the date when the loss or theft was reported to the law enforcement agency; and (4) such person&#39;s attempt to replace the regulated firearm occurs within thirty days
    of the loss or theft of such firearm, if known, or, if such date is not known, within thirty days of the date when the loss or theft was reported to the law enforcement agency, as reflected by the information recorded on the police report; and (vi)
    any other transaction authorized in advance in writing by the commissioner. h. Penalties. (i) In addition to the penalties specified in <a href='/adc/sections/10-310.html'>section 10-310</a>, any act or omission that constitutes or would constitute a violation of this section or of rules
    and regulations issued by the commissioner pursuant thereto shall be grounds for the revocation of a license to deal in firearms, deal in rifles and shotguns, possess firearms, or possess a rifle or shotgun. (ii) Any firearm disposed of or acquired
    in violation of this section shall be a nuisance subject to surrender and forfeiture in accordance with the procedures specified in section 400.05 of the penal law. i. The commissioner may make and promulgate such rules and regulations as are necessary
