(a) A taxpayer that has obtained the certifications required by chapter six-B of title twenty-two of the code shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter, provided,
    however, that a taxpayer that is a vendor of utility services shall not be allowed the credit against the tax imposed by this chapter unless it elects as provided in subdivision (d) of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/22-622.html'>section 22-622</a> of the code to take the credit against the tax
    imposed by this chapter. The amount of the credit shall be the amount determined by multiplying one thousand dollars or, in the case of an eligible business that has obtained pursuant to chapter six-B of such title twenty-two a certification of eligibility
    dated on or after July first, two thousand, for a relocation to eligible premises located within a revitalization area defined in subdivision (n) of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/22-621.html'>section 22-621</a> of the code, three thousand dollars, by the number of eligible aggregate employment
    shares maintained by the taxpayer during the calendar year with respect to particular premises to which the taxpayer has relocated; provided, however, with respect to a relocation for which no application for a certificate of eligibility is submitted
    prior to July first, two thousand three, to eligible premises that are within a revitalization area, if the date of such relocation as determined pursuant to subdivision (j) of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/22-621.html'>section 22-621</a> of the code is on or after January first, nineteen hundred
    ninety-nine, and before July first, two thousand, the amount to be multiplied by the number of eligible aggregate employment shares shall be one thousand dollars; provided, however, that no credit shall be allowed for the relocation of any retail
    activity or hotel services; and provided that in the case of an eligible business that has obtained pursuant to chapter six-B of such title twenty-two certifications of eligibility for more than one relocation, the portion of the total amount of eligible
    aggregate employment shares to be multiplied by the dollar amount specified in this subdivision for each such certification of a relocation shall be the number of total attributed eligible aggregate employment shares determined with respect to such
    relocation pursuant to subdivision (o) of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/22-621.html'>section 22-621</a> of the code. For purposes of this subdivision, the terms &quot;eligible aggregate employment shares&quot;, &quot;relocate&quot;, &quot;retail activity&quot; and &quot;hotel services&quot; shall have the meanings ascribed by <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/22-621.html'>section
    22-621</a> of the code. (b) The credit allowed under this subdivision with respect to eligible aggregate employment shares maintained with respect to particular premises to which the taxpayer has relocated shall be allowed for the taxable periods in the
    first calendar year during which such eligible aggregate employment shares are maintained with respect to such premises and for taxable periods in any of the twelve succeeding calendar years during which eligible aggregate employment shares are maintained
    with respect to such premises, provided that the credit allowed for the taxable periods in the twelfth succeeding calendar year shall be calculated by multiplying the number of eligible aggregate employment shares maintained with respect to such premises
    in the twelfth succeeding calendar year by the lesser of one and a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the calendar year of relocation less the number of days the eligible business maintained employment shares in the eligible
    premises in the calendar year of relocation and the denominator of which is the number of days in such twelfth succeeding year during which such eligible aggregate employment shares are maintained with respect to such premises. The credit allowable
    under this section shall be applied against the amount of tax otherwise required to be paid for the last taxable period of the calendar year as provided in subdivision a of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-1105.html'>section 11-1105</a> of this chapter, shall be deducted from the taxpayer&#39;s tax
    prior to the deduction of the credit provided in subdivision b of such section, and shall be claimed on the tax return for the last taxable period of the calendar year. Except as provided in subdivision (c) of this section, if the amount of the credit
    allowable under this subdivision for any calendar year exceeds the tax imposed for such last taxable period in such calendar year, the excess may be carried over, in order, to the immediately succeeding taxable periods in the five immediately succeeding
    calendar years and, to the extent not previously allowable, shall be applied against the tax otherwise required to be paid for such periods. Such carryover credit shall be deducted from the taxpayer&#39;s tax prior to the deduction of the credit provided
    in subdivision b of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-1105.html'>section 11-1105</a> of this chapter. With respect to the last taxable period in a calendar year, the credit for such calendar year shall be taken prior to any carryover credit. If in any period there are carryover credits available
    from more than one year, such credits shall be applied against the tax in the order in which they were earned with the oldest available credit being taken first. (c) In the case of a taxpayer that has obtained a certification of eligibility pursuant
    to chapter six-B of title twenty-two of the code dated on or after July first, two thousand for a relocation to eligible premises located within the revitalization area defined in subdivision (n) of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/22-621.html'>section 22-621</a> of the code, the credits allowed
    under this section, or in the case of a taxpayer that has relocated more than once, the portion of such credits attributed to such certification of eligibility pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section, against the tax imposed by this chapter for
    the calendar year of such relocation and for the four calendar years immediately succeeding the calendar year of such relocation, shall be deemed to be erroneous payments of tax by the taxpayer to be credited or refunded, in accordance with the provisions
    of <a href='/nyc/adc/sections/11-1108.html'>section 11-1108</a> of this chapter. For such calendar years, such credits or portions thereof may not be carried over to any succeeding taxable year; provided, however, that this subdivision shall not apply to any relocation for which an application
    for a certification of eligibility was not submitted prior to July first, two thousand three unless the date of such relocation is on or after July first, two thousand.
