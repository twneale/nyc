Should an original plan member discontinue city-service except by death or retirement, he or she shall be paid such part of the amount of the accumulated contributions (as defined in
    subdivision seven of <a href='//sections/13-313.html'>section 13-313</a> of this subchapter), that is, his or her contributions without interest, standing to the credit of his or her individual account in the contingent reserve fund as he or she shall demand. Such board, however, in
    its discretion, may withhold for not more than one year after such member last rendered city-service all or part of his or her accumulated contributions, if after a previous discontinuance of service he or she withdrew from the retirement allowance
    accumulation fund or the contingent reserve fund, as the case may be, all or part of the amount of his or her accumulated contributions and failed to redeposit such withdrawn amount in such fund. b. Should an improved benefits plan member discontinue
    city-service except by death or retirement, he or she shall be paid such part of the amount of the accumulated deductions (as defined in subdivision seven-a of such <a href='//sections/13-313.html'>section 13-313</a> of this subchapter) standing to the credit of his or her individual
    account in the annuity savings fund as he or she shall demand. Such board, however, in its discretion, may withhold for not more than one year after such a member last rendered city-service all or part of his or her accumulated deductions, if after
