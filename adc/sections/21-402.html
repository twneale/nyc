    period of reporting for the report issued concurrent with the issuance of the mayor&#39;s management report shall be the most recent fiscal year ended, and the period of reporting for the report issued concurrent with the issuance of the preliminary mayor&#39;s
    management report shall be the first four months of the fiscal year in which such report is issued. b. The commissioner shall submit to the city council copies of the following reports, and any revisions, updates or modifications to such reports,
    at the same time that each is submitted to the appropriate New York state agency or officer, or any successor thereto, elected official or other governmental body pursuant to any applicable statute, law, regulation or rule: i. the community services
    block grant management plan required to be submitted to the department of state; ii. the community services block grant program report required to be submitted to the governor and state legislature; and iii. the comprehensive planning report required
    to be submitted to the New York state division for youth within the executive department. c. Commencing on January 1, 2014 and annually thereafter, no later than every January 1st, the commissioner, in consultation with the commissioner of the administration
    for children&#39;s services (&quot;ACS&quot;) shall submit a yearly report to the speaker of the city council, documenting the number of youth in contact with the department&#39;s runaway and homeless youth services or ACS who are referred as, self-report as, or who
    the department or ACS later determine to be sexually exploited children, disaggregated by age utilizing the following ranges under 12 years old, 12-16 years old, 16-18 years old and over 18 years old, by gender and by whether such children had contact
    with the department or ACS. The department and ACS shall also determine and document in such report the number of such children identified as having received services from both the department and ACS. Such report shall also include a description of
    the services provided by the department and ACS to meet the needs of youth who are or have been sexually exploited children including, but not limited to the number of beds designated for such children and the types of mental health and health services
    provided to such children. Such report shall also include the department&#39;s and ACS&#39;s methods for collecting data regarding the number of sexually exploited children. Nothing herein shall require the department or ACS to share information that identifies
    such children. No information that is required to be reported pursuant to this section shall be reported in a manner that would violate any applicable provision of federal, state or local law relating to the privacy of such children&#39;s information.</span>
